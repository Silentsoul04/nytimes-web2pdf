bones.'}\label{id-like-to-meet-my-bones}}

\emph{--- From the poem ``If I Shut My Eyes, What Other Doors in Me Fly
Open,'' by Ben Purkert, in the collection ``For the Love of Endings''
(Four Way Books, 2018, Page 6).}

``The difference between the almost right word and the right word,''
Mark Twain wrote, ``is really a large matter --- 'tis the difference
between the lightning-bug and the lightning.'' Good writers,
accordingly, sift and combine words with the patient discernment of a
pharmacist or a pastry chef or a child sorting Legos. They measure
shades of meaning by the milligram.

Consider, for instance, the word ``meet.'' As Ben Purkert deploys it in
the sentence above, the word carries precisely the right dosage.
``Meet'' is common, simple and cheerful --- and yet in this context,
applied to one's own bones, it is also eerie and jarring and
nonsensical. It holds those very different feelings carefully in
suspension.

Purkert highlights a familiar paradox of human life. We are both
radically connected to, and yet disconnected from, our physical bodies.
Each of us carries, inside ourselves, a dark, slimy ecosystem: the wet
bags of our lungs, the spongy filters of our livers, the 100,000 miles
of our veins. If we are lucky, we will never actually see this world;
our job is to ride the roller coaster of consciousness, not examine the
engine room. Still, it is natural to be curious about these internal
objects --- to wonder what our bones look like or what our gallbladder
is doing at this very moment.

But body parts are emphatically not things we can ``meet.'' To meet is a
formal social transaction; it requires sentient beings on both sides.
You meet your roommate's parents or your biological mother or your
parole officer. Your rib cage is not a jaunty new acquaintance you can
chat with ata party. We might, in various ways, see our bones or know
our bones, but ``meet'' is precisely the wrong word. Which makes it, of
course, precisely the right word to communicate this fundamental human
truth: our alienation from ourselves.
