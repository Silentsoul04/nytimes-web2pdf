# How Bauhaus Redefined What Design Could Do for Society

A century after its founding, the German school of art and architecture
remains one of the most transcendent — and frustrating — movements of
the Modernist age.

ON APRIL 11, 1933, the architect [Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/ludwig-mies-van-der-rohe)
stepped off the tram in the Steglitz neighborhood in southwest
[Berlin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/23/t-magazine/berlin-guide.html),
crossed a bridge and found that his place of work had been surrounded by
the police. [The
Bauhaus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/14/travel/bauhaus-germany-art-design.html),
where he taught and served as the director, had occupied an old
telephone factory building there since 1932. The school first opened in
Weimar in 1919, as a place for uniting craftsmanship with the arts in
the service of architecture; over time, it changed, becoming more about
uniting art with industrial techniques. Once Mies took over the
directorship in 1930, it became almost purely a school for architecture.

But this instability, even vagueness, of purpose helped propagate its
influence. In just over a decade, it had become a byword for modernity
in design, a symbol of a progressive age across the world, from [New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/11/03/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-manhattan-new-york-city.html)
to
[Calcutta](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/22/travel/budget-travel-kolkata-india.html?login=email&auth=login-email).
The Nazis perceived the Bauhaus to be, along with atonal music and
Expressionist painting, yet another specimen of the globe-spanning
Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy they sought to eliminate. They weren’t wrong
to intuit a basic radicalism at the heart of the Bauhaus project:
Uniting all of its multiple tendencies and impulses was an attempt to
put art and architecture to use as social regeneration for the world’s
working classes. As National Socialism steadily took power across the
country, the school became itinerant, always in search of a safe home.
It traveled from Weimar, where it lay not far from where the
constitution of the first German Republic had been drawn up, to
industrial Dessau, where it left its most enduring architectural
presence, before ending up in the capital, where its time would be
fleeting, with no physical testament to its having ever been there. By
that point, the Bauhaus was on its third director, Mies; political
developments ensured that he was to be the last.

The local government in Dessau, among the first municipalities in
Germany to be won by the National Socialists in 1931, had voted to close
the Bauhaus, which was a state-funded school, in 1932. Mies reopened it
as a private institution in Berlin later that year, but it only lasted
one semester. The Nazis in Dessau sought, according to one fascist
editorial, nothing less than “the disappearance from German soil of one
of the most prominent places of Jewish-Marxist ‘art’ manifestation,” and
they were not going to relent. With Hitler now chancellor of Germany,
the Dessau public prosecutor called for a search of the school’s new
Berlin headquarters. The police found materials that were deemed to be
subversive, making it subject to closure. Three months of fruitless
attempts by Mies and others to forestall this inevitable conclusion
followed; they tried various ways to accommodate themselves to the Nazis
and preserve the Bauhaus as a private art school. But in the end, the
Dessau authorities used a new Nazi law to declare that “support for and
action on behalf of the Bauhaus, which presented itself as a Bolshevist
cell,” amounted to a political crime. In July 1933, Mies and other
Bauhaus masters gathered together at the studio of the interior designer
Lilly Reich in Berlin. Mies discussed the financial and political
situation of the school and proposed that it should be closed. The
proposal was met with unanimous agreement, and the Bauhaus was
dissolved.

THIS, THE FORMAL end to the Bauhaus as a school, only precipitated the
birth of the Bauhaus as an enduring myth, with its various iterations
created and carried on by its former students and teachers, who began to
flee Germany, arriving on the shores and at the borders of other nations
as refugees. What might plausibly have been only a minor episode in the
history of Modernism became a recurring one, translated into different
languages and geographies and contexts and economies: a movement whose
aesthetic was inextricable from the fact of its diaspora. In retrospect,
the Bauhaus invested a particular concept, “design,” with such a
quantity of meaning that it overwhelmed the word. Governments across the
globe were experimenting with forms of planning, from the city block to
the factory floor to the entire economy itself. In that context, the
Bauhaus was an idea that could accompany that process — could give
aesthetic, architectural and spiritual weight to the revival of society
through design.

Naturally, everyone had their own version of what this looked like. Over
time, the exodus took the Bauhaus to
[London](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/16/travel/five-places-to-visit-in-london.html),
New York,
[Chicago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/18/travel/what-to-do-in-chicago.html),
[Tel
Aviv](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2015/12/30/travel/what-to-do-in-36-hours-in-tel-aviv.html).
Walter Gropius, the principal founder, made his way to Massachusetts and
became a longtime professor at
[Harvard](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/harvard-university);
Hannes Meyer, the second director and an avowed Marxist, followed his
political ideals to the Soviet Union. After the war, some stayed abroad
in their newly adopted homes; others returned to one or another side of
a newly divided Germany, each part of which would refashion its own
Bauhaus. The New Bauhaus was founded in Chicago in 1937 (now known as
the [Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of
Technology](https://id.iit.edu/the-new-bauhaus/)), and another “new”
Bauhaus was founded in the West German city of Ulm in the 1950s (the Ulm
School of Design). The politics of the Cold War constricted and hardened
the available meanings of the Bauhaus. West Germany adopted the Bauhaus
as a symbol of democracy, East Germany much later as a symbol of
progress. For left-wing members of the ’68 student revolts, Bauhaus was
stultifying conformity; for the right-wing American novelist and writer
[Tom
Wolfe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/15/obituaries/tom-wolfe-pyrotechnic-nonfiction-writer-and-novelist-dies-at-88.html),
author of the 1981 polemic “[From Bauhaus to Our
House](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312429140),” it was the same.
Everyone had founded or refounded or kept in their memory their own
Bauhaus, each smaller than the original. It was among the oldest stories
of exile: Remember Aeneas, the refugee, who, on the wayward trail to
Italy, finds that Helenus, a son of Priam, is married to the widowed
wife of his brother Hector, and that they have built for themselves a
Troy in miniature.

I went to Germany in September of last year to visit the remaining sites
of the Bauhaus in advance of the 100th anniversary of its opening, but
it was impossible not to think of its closing and the trajectories of
the school’s refugees. “You’ve picked an interesting time to come to
Germany,” a friend told me when I arrived in Berlin. Just days before,
thousands of neo-Nazis had [marched in
Chemnitz](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/30/world/europe/germany-neo-nazi-protests-chemnitz.html),
in eastern Germany, and, surrounding an enormous statue of Karl Marx,
who had once fled Germany for political reasons himself, had declared
their hostility to immigration and refugees. In Bitterfeld, where I was
transferring trains from Dessau to Weimar — toward the end of the German
Democratic Republic, it was the world’s most polluted city — a drunk man
seated himself next to me and repeatedly asked me where I came from and
why I came, denouncing [Angela
Merkel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/07/world/europe/angela-merkel-germany.html)’s
refugee policy. Inspecting the collections of the [Bauhaus-Universität
Weimar](https://www.uni-weimar.de/en/university/start/), the archivist
reminded me that the Bauhaus was forced to leave the city because of the
rise of the political right — “just like today\!” she cried, with
gallows cheeriness. Last October, Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union
party posted disastrous results in regional elections in Bavaria and
Hesse, and [Merkel
announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/29/world/europe/angela-merkel-germany.html?module=inline)
that she would step down as party leader and would not seek re-election
as chancellor in 2021. Even sections of the political left were
proposing more restrictions on asylum for
refugees.

Germany is beset by anniversaries, many of them celebrating unhappy or
ambiguous events, which it nonetheless feels duty bound to observe. But
the founding of the Bauhaus happens to be one of the few good ones, and
the country is marking the centenary with a flurry of building and
activity. Two new museums are set to open this year, in Dessau and
Weimar; the [Bauhaus-Archiv](https://www.bauhaus.de/en/) in Berlin is
adding a new building to be completed in 2022; and all the various
sites, from small housing projects to the central, monumental building
in Dessau, are being outfitted with new displays. A full calendar of
events is taking place in each city throughout the year. Television
shows are in the works: During my visit, at the site of the school’s
first headquarters in Weimar, a German production company was filming a
six-part dramatic mini-series with the working title “Bauhaus: The New
Era.” The floors were strewn with piles of camera equipment and period
newspapers, and I waited for a mustachioed, cream-suited, fictional
Gropius to finish conducting business in the real Gropius’s original
office before I could make my visit. The subject of the show is typical
of a newer approach to the Bauhaus: The main protagonist is a historical
figure, Dörte Helm, a painter who entered the school in 1919 and found
both freedom and constriction in the heady atmosphere. In the show, Helm
has an affair with Gropius (there was a rumor that he had an affair with
a student in Weimar, but it was never proven), and she protests the
unequal treatment of women at the school. For years, the roster of
Bauhaus luminaries — such as Gropius, Mies, [Wassily
Kandinsky](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/search?query=Kandinsky%252C+Wassily)
and [Paul
Klee](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/search?query=Klee%252C+Paul) —
was seen as exclusively male; recently, the contributions (as well as
marginalization) of its brilliant women designers — such as Gunta Stölzl
and [Anni
Albers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/08/arts/tate-modern-anni-albers-retrospective.html)
in textiles; Lotte Stam-Beese in architecture; and Ré Soupault in
fashion design, photography and journalism — have been the subject of
continuing scholarship. “Blaupause” (“Blueprint”), a well-received novel
by Theresia Enzensberger about a female student at the Bauhaus who wants
to be an architect, is coming out in English this year.

While “Bauhaus” became shorthand for functionalist architecture, an
identikit style of angular, boxy white buildings and ribbon windows,
there were, in fact, many different Bauhauses that existed during the
school’s short life span, and even more so in its afterlife. What made
for its vitality was the sheer number of movements for which the Bauhaus
provided temporary shelter: Expressionism, functionalism and — as the
Nazis correctly surmised — Communism. Many came to the Bauhaus because
they wanted to refound the world, from the pot in which you brewed your
tea to the painting you hung on your wall to the housing complex that
you lived in and the street that you walked on. Only a few buildings
emerged from the brains on campus. More common were the designs for
typefaces, furniture, flatware: a planned revolution in the texture and
feel and look of everyday life. Gropius would speak of a “new unity,”
first of craft and fine art, later of art and technology, the ultimate
aim being the building as a *Gesamtkunstwerk*, or total work of art (he
would later call this “total architecture”). It was a school that was
also — unusual for Germany — a campus: a place where students and
teachers came to live. It was meant to embody the life that its teachers
and students were also expected to make available to the world.

The sensuous, humane, world-changing spirit of the Bauhaus was captured
by the American poet, essayist and former architecture student [June
Jordan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/06/18/arts/june-jordan-65-poet-and-political-activist.html)
in her book “[Civil
Wars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1981/08/09/books/opinions-and-poems.html)”
(1981). Recalling her early interest in architecture in New York City,
she remembered thinking while paging through design books at the public
library that:

> If I could make things as simple, as necessary, and as wonderful as a
> spoon of Bauhaus design, then I could be sure, in a deep way, of doing
> some good, of changing, for instance, the kitchen where I grew up,
> baffled by the archaeological layers of aimless, wrong-year calendars,
> and high-gloss, clashing wall colors, and four cans of paprika and
> endlessly, dysfunctional clutter/material of no morale, of clear,
> degenerating morass and mire, of slum, of resignation.

One hundred years on, the Bauhaus will once again be exhumed, today amid
conditions around the world that echo those of its birth and collapse: a
decade of economic crisis; hundreds of millions poorly or not at all
housed; plutocracy unchecked; the far-right rampant; endless war, now
often conducted under the aegis of the United States; swelling attacks
on migrants and refugees; the appearance everywhere of walls, camps,
barbed wire; the sudden resurgence in the public sphere of Nazi salutes
and swastikas.

In Berlin, where the Bauhaus ended, it also re-emerges in one of the
worst housing crises since the end of World War II, where lately prices
have been rising faster than in any other city in the world. “The
hardest hit, as everywhere, are those who have no choice,” wrote the
philosopher Theodor Adorno, reflecting broadly on the idea of the home,
in 1944. “They live, if not in slums, in bungalows that tomorrow may be
leaf-huts, trailers, cars, camps, or the open air.” The Bauhaus emerged
to forestall just such a dire situation, only to be defeated by it. But
what remains of its sparse record, its ennobled settings for the
underprivileged, demonstrates the possibility for art and architecture
to not only serve as a balm for a turbulent history but also as an
alternative to
it.

TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL of the Bauhaus is in some sense to invite
disappointment. Not much was built that the Bauhaus could call its own.
The central building, finished in sleepy Dessau in 1926, has been
lovingly restored and is its one gleaming masterpiece: an asymmetrical
complex separated into functions, only comprehensible in its use rather
than at a single glance, with brightly colored beams and accent walls.
The Masters’ Houses, where Gropius and his colleagues lived, give less
to the imagination. Both Gropius’s and the photographer [Laszlo
Moholy-Nagy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/27/arts/design/moholy-nagy-future-present-vision-and-precision-in-a-fluid-braid.html)’s
homes were bombed during the war and were reconstructed in a more
streamlined form in 2014 by the architecture firm [Bruno Fioretti
Marquez](https://bfm.berlin/); the Kandinsky/Klee House, which survived
the war, is being renovated. In fact, all of these buildings were
designed by Gropius’s office, not by students or teachers in the
Bauhaus. But part of the disappointment also comes from the fact that
some of the school’s best achievements are, while thoughtful, not
immediately beautiful. They bear the impress of a collective setting out
to solve fundamentally social, rather than formal, problems.

theater designer [Oskar
Schlemmer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1984/01/22/arts/dance-bauhaus-design-by-oskar-schlemmer.html).
Hidden in the folds of this fairly straightforward history is an
enormous variety of activities that went on under the name Bauhaus:
controversies and internal dissent, party going and occult happenings,
affairs and fights and struggles simply to maintain the school’s
financial existence in one of the most tumultuous periods in the history
of Germany. Gropius, a man of military build and significant reserve —
his ex-wife, [Alma
Mahler](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1964/12/12/archives/alma-m-werfel-widow-of-writer-she-was-also-married-to-mahler-and.html),
wrote to him, “Your beautiful male hardness is a wall around you” —
emphasized collective work but preserved medieval hierarchies: In the
manner of a guild, there were various ranks of “masters.” When Gropius
introduced an architecture course led by Hannes Meyer in 1927, women
were steered away from taking it, and overall, they were largely
segregated in the textile classes.

Much of the early controversy around the Bauhaus centered on Johannes
Itten, the first teacher of the school’s innovative, multidisciplinary
preliminary course (Vorkurs). A follower of Mazdaznan, a religion with
roots in
[Zoroastrianism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/09/06/us/06faith.html),
he shaved his head, dressed in robes and practiced strict vegetarianism.
(Alma Mahler, a composer who, before Gropius, was married to the
composer Gustav Mahler, and after to the writer Franz Werfel, expressed
in her 1958 memoir her horror at the “obligatory diet of uncooked mush
in garlic” that Itten insisted be served on campus and noted that she
found “Bauhaus disciples recognizable at a distance, by the garlic
smell.”) Itten began classes with gymnastics and breathing exercises
before moving on to elemental discussions of the nature of materials,
the contrasts between them and aspects of color theory — all in order to
reground students in new perceptions of the basics of making art and
objects. He held classes at the Tempelherrenhaus, an 18th-century
neo-Gothic folly, where he could scandalize the bourgeoisie of Weimar en
plein air. Eventually seen as too spiritual and craft-oriented for the
early Bauhaus, Itten was essentially forced to depart by Gropius. He was
replaced in 1923 by Moholy-Nagy, who had a far more traditional
pedagogical approach — though Itten’s influence on the curriculum
persisted for several
years.

On the other side of Ittenism lay the Bauhaus’s communism, another
insolubility. Early histories of the Bauhaus, filtered through West
Germany, where the first Bauhaus archive was founded, and the United
States, where several of the key instructors lived after the school
closed down, minimized the influence of socialism on the school. At the
start of the Bauhaus, Gropius’s own sympathies were often unstated and
unclear. In 1920, he had designed an exceptional monument to the
striking workers who had resisted a putsch attempt to end the German
republic in Weimar: a snaking concrete thunderbolt rising up in the
middle of the cemetery among the grave sites of Thuringia’s most
hallowed bourgeois families. His appeals to unite craft and fine art
echoed the British socialist William Morris, who blamed capitalism for
the degradation of the decorative arts, among other societal ills. But
he was otherwise unaffiliated, and having moved to the United States in
1937, he did his best after World War II to accommodate himself to the
Cold War norm.

The mandarin Mies, who had also produced a monument to the left — his
was to the assassinated Communists Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg —
made no secret of his hostility to Communists at the Bauhaus, expelling
many of them, as he programmatically tried to ensure that the Bauhaus
became strictly an architecture school, focused on producing work of
high quality for the upper classes. Both Mies’s and Gropius’s leftist
memorials were eventually destroyed by the Nazis, but in 1933, out of
some combination of ego, opportunism and survival instinct, the two of
them seriously competed for Hitler’s first big architectural commission,
a new building for the national bank, which brings to mind the [Bertolt
Brecht](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/14/books/review/bertolt-brecht-collected-poems.html)
aphorism “Robbing a bank’s no crime compared to owning one.”

Historians have especially sought to separate the Bauhaus from politics
by denigrating the contributions of its least-understood director,
Hannes Meyer, a committed Communist who led the Bauhaus from 1928 to
1930. Where Gropius had attempted to move the school toward a closer
union with German industry, with the aim of making products for a
general market, as well as adopting a broadly formalist approach to
architecture, Meyer, though also working with industry, was more
explicitly political in his aims. “*Volksbedarf statt Luxusbedarf*”
(“The needs of the people instead of the need of luxury”) became his
slogan and that of the students who followed him. He reorganized the
curriculum, emphasizing the importance of building as a social, rather
than formal, phenomenon. In April 1919, Gropius had published the
founding manifesto along with the basic program for the school: “The
ultimate aim of all artistic activity is building\!” he wrote. “The
ultimate, if distant, aim of the Bauhaus is the unified work of art.” In
1929, writing in the Bauhaus journal, Meyer consciously revised the
statement, in poetic form, no less: “thus the ultimate aim of all
Bauhaus work / the summation of all life-forming forces / to the
harmonious arrangement of our society.” Later, Gropius would adopt
similar language, calling for the planner and designer to take up “the
civilized life of man in all its major aspects,” a form of dirigisme
that could only be satisfied under comprehensive central planning.

Despite his short tenure, Meyer has a nearly equal claim with Gropius to
what remains of the Bauhaus’s built record, including the one Bauhaus
building in the region around Berlin: a trade-union school in the De
Chirico-dreary suburb of Bernau. This building, not a standard stop on
the Bauhaus tour, is one of the school’s most extraordinary achievements
and a monument to its educational mission. Except that here, the
education was designed for ordinary workers, and the spirit of the
Bauhaus was meant to infuse the everyday lives of trade unionists.

Unlike Gropius’s Bauhaus building, which rises from a flattened
landscape and makes a show of a long glass curtain-walled facade, the
ADGB Trade Union School is built into a hillside, its various rooms and
functions disaggregated into a series of connected buildings of
diminishing height: more a complex than a single structure,
incomprehensible at any particular moment or angle. Its most bravura
feature is a glass-walled corridor that descends the slope on the
school’s northwest side, breaking off on the right into dormitories as
you walk down. Even on a gray afternoon, floods of light pour in through
the windows, and the landscape runs right up to meet you on the other
side of the curtain wall. There is also a subtle use of materials and
color: The low, dark-wood-slatted roof is threaded with thin red beams,
and the floor is gray cement, at once brightening and subduing the
atmosphere. Like the corridor, designed to encourage fraternizing in
between courses, the other collective spaces are simultaneously
light-filled, airy and monumental-feeling. In the extraordinary dining
hall, thick exposed concrete columns and beams lift and segment the
roof, which is lined with glass brick to filter in light.

Outside the bungalows for the ADGB Trade Union schoolteachers, a small
plaque with a relief sculpture records a tribute to Hermann Duncker, one
of the founders of the German Communist Party, with the slogan “*Jeder
kann alles lernen*” (“Everyone can learn everything”). After 1933, the
Nazis turned the ADGB into a training school for the
SS.

THE HISTORY OF the Bauhaus is therefore also a history of its
controversies, false starts and failures: Directors failed to maintain
order, politics overran the school, women were consistently
subordinated. It is also a history in which design as a social concern
gave way to design as the styling of consumer goods. But it is also a
history of other schools, with which it was contemporary and to which it
gave birth. The poet Rabindranath Tagore’s [Visva-Bharati
University](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/02/03/travel/where-a-poets-vision-lives-on-in-india.html),
founded in Santiniketan in rural West Bengal, India, in 1921, bears
comparison with the Bauhaus. (Tagore, who visited the school on a trip
to Europe that year, also helped organize a 1922 exhibition in Calcutta
featuring artists from the Bauhaus and the Indian avant-garde.) So, too,
does [Black Mountain
College](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/12/18/arts/design/the-short-life-and-long-legacy-of-black-mountain-college.html)
in Asheville, N.C., founded in 1933, the year the Bauhaus closed, where
Josef and Anni Albers taught. [Max
Bill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1994/12/14/obituaries/max-bill-85-painter-sculptor-and-architect-in-austere-style.html),
a former Bauhaus student, co-founded the [Ulm School of
Design](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1964/02/04/archives/ulm-school-carries-on-bauhaus-aims.html)
in 1953 in West Germany, which collaborated early on with the German
manufacturing company Braun, whose Dieter Rams-designed products
directly influenced [Jony
Ive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1998/02/05/garden/at-home-with-jonathan-ive-making-computers-cute-enough-to-wear.html),
the chief designer of Apple. Which brings us back via a commodius vicus
to design as the styling of consumer goods.

Why did things end up there? After all, the Bauhaus began as a protest
against the thoughtless direction of industrialization, the harm it did
to mind and spirit. “Only work which is the product of an inner
compulsion can have spiritual meaning,” Gropius wrote in 1923.
“Mechanized work is lifeless, proper only to the lifeless machine ...
The solution depends on a change in the individual’s attitude toward his
work.” But Gropius was also intent on partnering with German industry to
market Bauhaus products; under Meyer’s directorship, the Bauhaus
actually became profitable through its commercial partnerships.
Nonetheless, he encouraged the internal agitation of the increasing
number of Communist students — even the Bauhaus journal took on a
communist bent — and his activities (not to mention the prospect of a
financially independent Bauhaus) began to be viewed with alarm by the
Dessau authorities. In July 1930, the mayor dismissed him, and Mies was
anointed as his successor. In an alternately lugubrious, self-pitying
and sarcastic open letter, Meyer accused the city of “attempting to rid
the Bauhaus, so heavily infected by me, of the spirit of Marxism”:

> Morality, propriety, manners, and order are now to return once more
> hand in hand with the Muses. As my successor you have had Mies van der
> Rohe prescribed for you by Gropius and not — according to the statutes
> — on the advice of the Masters. My colleague poor fellow, is no doubt
> expected to take his pickax and demolish my work in blissful
> commemoration of the Moholyan past of the Bauhaus. It looks as if this
> wicked materialism is to be fought with the sharpest weapons and hence
> the very life beaten out of the innocent white Bauhaus box. ... I see
> through it all. I understand nothing.

In 1930, Meyer arrived in Moscow along with several of his students. He
became involved in several Soviet projects, including commissions
related to the country’s first five-year plan, but he found that
scarcity of materials, plus the neo-Classical taste of [Joseph
Stalin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/joseph-stalin),
stymied many of his efforts. Like countless others, Meyer and his
foreign associates came under suspicion in the era of Stalin’s purges,
and in 1936, he emigrated to Switzerland. Two years later, he moved to
Mexico, where he was appointed the director of a short-lived institute
for urban planning. He remained there for 10 years, working mostly in
public service, before returning to Switzerland, where he died in
1954.

The triumph, after the war, of the Bauhaus as a style and a brand were
almost inversely proportional to its failure as a social program.
Bauhaus furniture and objects became marketable, Bauhaus architecture a
cuboid product available to anyone. Bauhaus became one more form of
enabling the growth of consumer society, with its microgradations of
taste corresponding to class and status. One of the high (or low) points
was the [exhibition of a model
house](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3251?) by the Bauhaus
alumnus [Marcel
Breuer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1981/07/02/nyregion/marcel-breuer-79-dies-architect-and-designer.html)
in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art in 1949: An early
blockbuster exhibition in MoMA’s history, it also betrayed the spirit of
the school by showing a house that was far too expensive for most
working-class Americans. (John D. Rockefeller Jr. bought the actual
house that was exhibited and used it as a guesthouse on his estate in
Pocantico Hills, N.Y.) This was a trend observable even to Bauhaus
contemporaries. In a 1930 essay titled “Ten Years of the Bauhaus,” the
Hungarian art theorist Erno Kallai, who edited the Bauhaus journal under
Meyer, laconically telegraphed the standardization of form at the
expense of content: “Tubular steel armchair frames: Bauhaus style. Lamp
with nickel-coated body and a disk of opaque glass as lampshade: Bauhaus
style. Wallpaper patterned in cubes: Bauhaus style. No painting on the
wall: Bauhaus style.”

One of the fears that attends the centenary is that this Bauhaus brand
will overwhelm any similar attempt to revive the radical spirit of the
school at its founding. As the Bauhaus’s influence spread across the
world as the pre-eminent global design concept of the postwar era, its
history and goals became increasingly watered down, a way to sell
gift-shop-ready objects and promote cultural tourism instead of using
design to improve the lives of working-class people. This contrast has
created a complicated legacy. A loose grouping of intellectuals and
architectural theorists, which goes under the name Projekt Bauhaus,
intends to take the problem head-on. Last September, I met with Anh-Linh
Ngo, one of its members and the editor in chief of [Arch+
magazine](https://www.archplus.net/home/), in eastern Mitte, a now tony
section of former East Berlin with many examples of spruced up
Plattenbau, prefab concrete housing construction. Ngo told me the group
wants to “look at the legacy of the Bauhaus from an outside, critical
perspective.” In honor of the original Bauhaus’s critical spirit, they
intend — while everyone in Berlin, Dessau and Weimar is celebrating the
centenary — to conduct a ceremonial “burial” of the Bauhaus, culminating
in a musical requiem directed by Schorsch Kamerun at the Volksbühne
theater in Berlin in June.

“We need to bury this kind of undead figure — this kind of zombie — to
put certain aspects of the Bauhaus to rest in order to deal with our own
problems,” Ngo told me. Those problems are much in evidence in Germany,
he said, with the rise once more of the far right. He pointed to their
attempts to gain hegemony in urban spaces using techniques pioneered by
the student movement. There are reconstruction projects taking place all
over Germany that focus on aspects of pre-20th century German heritage
(especially churches), which are primarily initiatives of the far right.
Perhaps thinking of the attacks on refugees that had taken place in
Chemnitz just a week before we spoke, he suggested quietly that, rather
than resurrect the Bauhaus once again, it was “more important to think
about the mutual obligations we have toward each other.”

TO SEE THE SITES of the Bauhaus firsthand today is in many ways to
glimpse the failure of its collective wisdom: Buildings that weren’t
destroyed or commandeered by the Nazis were left to slowly decay after
the war, and the ones that still function mostly do so as tourist
landmarks. And yet, especially with the works that still operate as they
were originally intended, it is possible to glimpse the image of the
future that the Bauhaus evoked for its students, teachers and
contemporaries.

Unlike Weimar, with its overwhelming German classical and Romantic
heritage — the erstwhile home of Goethe and Liszt — the eerie, moribund
town of Dessau is overwhelmed by the legacy of the Bauhaus. The capital
of one of the country’s numerous provincial princely states from the
16th to the early 19th century, it was almost completely destroyed by
Allied bombing in World War II, which targeted the city because of its
role in airplane manufacturing. During the onslaught, the main Bauhaus
building was somehow spared, if damaged. During the German Democratic
Republic, it again became an industrial center and played host to an
impressive variety (if that is the term) of Plattenbau, still visible
across the skyline. The average age of the residents is 50.

In Dessau, the complex known as the Laubenganghäuser, and usually
translated with dogged literalness as the “Houses With Balcony Access,”
reflects the humane principles of reproducible workers’ housing.
Designed under Hannes Meyer, these, like the ADGB Trade Union School,
were true Bauhaus buildings, conceived and executed under the collective
imprimatur of the Bauhaus. Three-story brick buildings, with apartments
linked by long-running balconies — a precursor to the “streets in the
sky” of later British social housing complexes — the Laubenganghäuser
cram a number of amenities into small spaces. Kitchen cabinets are
hidden behind sliding doors; bright shades of maroon and mauve enliven
the otherwise incredibly tight quarters, which give off an impression of
openness and space. A current resident recently told Berlin’s [Monopol
magazine](https://www.monopol-magazin.de/) that because there aren’t
“sterile corridors in the building,” residents “spend a lot of time
outdoors, so neighbors often come into contact with each other. It feels
more like a community than an apartment building, and many people have
become friends.” Here was a vision of the Bauhaus’s potential beyond
consumer society, beyond the rule of markets and private property — one
in which collective provision defeats private greed, and in which
strangers are made to feel welcome as members of a group. Had history
not intervened, there might have been more of them in Dessau: nearly
anonymous testaments to the ideals of the old, fractious, continuously
fascinating school, present only by implication, as its students and
teachers wanted, in everyday life.
