A few days before Christmas, a group of 20 or so people crowded into the
Mexican novelist Valeria Luiselli’s living room. Luiselli dipped in and
out among her guests, serving mulled wine as school-aged children from
Still Waters in a Storm, an educational center in Brooklyn focused on
reading and writing, prepared to perform an original musical adapted
from Cervantes’ “Don Quixote.” The children had worked with the center’s
founder, Stephen Haff, to translate the book from the Spanish and write
songs reinterpreting the story with a chorus of migrant children. By the
time Haff told the children to find their spots on the small makeshift
stage, the seats had filled up, so Luiselli sat on the floor next to her
9-year-old daughter, Maia. It wasn’t the first time Luiselli had seen
the show, but she still cried, as did her daughter, when the children
sang songs with lyrics like, “Innocence needs a home.”

The experiences of asylum-seeking children from Latin America have
preoccupied Luiselli for several years now and serve as a central theme
in her latest book about a family road trip across the United States.
“Lost Children Archive,” which will be published by Knopf next week,
is Luiselli’s fifth book, and the first of her novels to be written in
English.

\[ [*Read our review of “Lost Children
Archive.”*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/11/books/review-lost-children-archive-valeria-luiselli.html)
\]

When Luiselli, 35, started writing “Lost Children Archive” in the summer
of 2014, she struggled with using it “as a loudspeaker for all of my
political rage.” She had volunteered as a court translator for child
refugees from Latin America and was therefore familiar with the
migration crisis. She set aside the novel and wrote [“Tell Me How it
Ends: An Essay in 40
Questions,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/28/books/review/tell-me-how-it-ends-valeria-luiselli.html)
a meditation on the children’s stories and the circumstances that
brought them to the United States. It was formatted after the
questionnaire the court had her use to interview the children and was a
finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism in
2017. Afterward, Luiselli said, she was able to return to her novel and
offer “more open questions and open ends instead of political stances
that are too loud and obvious by themselves.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The formal inventiveness of “Tell Me How It Ends” is characteristic of
all of Luiselli’s former work. Diego Rabasa, who has edited Luiselli’s
books with Sexto Piso, an independent press in Mexico City, said her
first book, “Papeles Falsos” (translated as “Sidewalks” in English),
contained elements of literary, personal and travel essays. “There has
always been a distinct aura of brilliance and intelligence surrounding
her,” said Rabasa. “What dazzled us was the audacity of a young writer
who was starting on such an original path.”

Luiselli characterized her first book, which was rejected by several
publishing houses before it was acquired by Sexto Piso, as an attempt to
“write myself into my mother tongue” after a lifetime living away from
Mexico. She had always studied in English, so when it came to Spanish,
“I never had the inflections of the people my age. It didn’t get
renewed with slang and street
talk.”

Luiselli first left Mexico at the age of 2, when her father moved the
family to Madison, Wis., to complete his doctorate. From there, her
father’s work as a diplomat took them to Costa Rica, South Korea and
South Africa, where they arrived in 1994, shortly after Mandela’s
historic election. By then, her mother had left the family to join the
Zapatista movement in Mexico. “I come from a matriarchal line of women
who have always been very involved politically and socially,” she said,
referring also to her grandmother, who worked with indigenous
communities in Puebla, Mexico. After attending boarding school in India,
she decided, as she puts it, “I need to go back to Mexico and become
Mexican,” Luiselli recalled. She was 19 when she enrolled at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico to major in philosophy and
began writing there.

Luiselli followed “Papeles Falsos” in 2011 with a novel, “Los
Ingrávidos” (“Faces in the Crowd”). It has been translated into 20
languages. Rabasa noted that the book remains one of Sexto Piso’s most
popular and is reprinted every year. “The Story of my Teeth,” Luiselli’s
second novel, was the product of a collaboration with Jumex factory
workers in Mexico, in which she sent them chapters, and they helped her
shape the plot. Her books always reflect a deep plunge into her
sensibilities — books and cultural references, and even real people and
places where she’s been. In “Lost Children Archive,” for instance, Still
Waters in a Storm is mentioned, as are Haff, obscure Italian writers and
Ezra Pound.

“I have never written a novel that just sort of springs from the head of
Zeus, from an absolute space of fiction,” Luiselli said. “I always begin
my work documenting my

“She’s really wrestling with a certain strand of Latino and Latin
American identity in the U.S. in this political moment,” said the
novelist Daniel Alarcón, who has sat on panels with Luiselli. In “Tell
Me How It Ends,” in particular, he said, “she confronts directly
questions of privilege and gaze, at the same time wrestling with a
political moment that affects not just all Latinos but all Americans.”

“Without knowing it or planning to, she has opened doors,” said her
friend, the writer Laia Jufresa, who told me she never imagined a
Mexican writer could plausibly achieve the number of translations,
awards or critical acclaim Luiselli has in her early career.

Both the novelist Francisco Goldman and Rabasa mentioned the —
“insufferable,” in Goldman’s words — macho culture of Mexican
literature. Goldman rattled off a list of woman writers, besides
Luiselli, who have been causing a seismic shift in the country’s
literary world over the last decade: Gabriela Jauregui, Guadalupe
Nettel, Verónica Gerber Bicecci, Jufresa and Fernanda Melchor.

The Argentine novelist Samanta Schweblin, whose second book, “Mouthful
of Birds,” was published in January, said Luiselli’s vision is a cross
between the Latin American and the North American views of the world.
“Both visions are so nostalgic, critical, loving and painful at the
same time. Valeria belongs to both territories and therefore understands
their signals, but at the same time she seems to always understand
herself as a foreigner,” wrote Schweblin in a recent email. Perhaps, she
said, having one foot in each world is why Luiselli’s literature is
charged with the lucidness of estrangement.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Luiselli is currently exploring different art forms altogether. She
recently received an Art for Justice fellowship to research and write
about mass incarceration in the United States, with an emphasis on
detention centers. “The same companies own immigration jails and normal
jails,” she said, and many don’t understand that “immigration detention
and mass incarceration are exactly the same thing.”

She started a literary program to teach creative writing to girls in a
detention center in upstate New York. She is also working on a
performance piece related to mass incarceration and violence against
women with the poet Natalie Diaz. In the fall, she will begin a two-year
residency at Bard College.

Luiselli lives in the Bronx and jokes that she is raising her daughter,
whose father is the Mexican novelist Álvaro Enrigue, in a household full
of women (her niece lives with her and her mother visits often). “I feel
my female bonds stronger than ever in my life, the way that women can
group and discuss and think politically, and also just how friends can
get together and be a network of support,” Luiselli said.

“Lost Children Archive” was in large part a response to seeing her
daughter try to interpret the current migration crisis. “Children can
add a tinge of bizarreness to what is possibly accepted as normal but
actually is not,” said Luiselli. Her approach is to discuss issues with
her daughter “in a way that she is not scared — that she finds the right
balance between a certain rage or outrage and clarity to imagine
possible change.”
