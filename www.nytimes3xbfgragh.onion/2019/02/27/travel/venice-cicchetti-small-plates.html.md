# When in Venice, Eat Like a Venetian

</div>

When they want a bite, locals head to their favorite bacaro for
cicchetti, the Venetian version of tapas. Here are seven of the best
places to find them.

Each year, 20 million tourists visit Venice. The vast majority will pay
too much for indifferent food eaten mostly in the company of other
tourists. But there’s one way to eat great Venetian food that’s
thrilling, filling and authentic. You’ll find it at a place where you’re
almost certain to rub and bend elbows with locals. Visit a bacaro.

Like Spain’s tapas bars, the bacaro ** serves infinitely varied,
kaleidoscopically colorful small plates at prices even a budget traveler
can afford. What makes the Venetian version unique is that the menu
changes not only seasonally (you’re in Italy after all), but day by day
and hour by hour.

Venetians call these small plates cicchetti (pronounced “chi-KET-tee”) —
said to derive from the Latin “ciccus,” meaning “little” or “nothing.”
The term embraces a broad range of dishes: polpette (fried meatballs),
crostini (small open-faced sandwiches), panini (small sandwiches on
crusty rolls), tramezzini (triangular white bread sandwiches) — and a
scintillating array of pickled, baked, stuffed or sauced seafoods and
vegetables.

You find cicchetti at a bacaro ** (wine bar), but also at a botegòn,
cantina, cicchetteria*,* enoteca ** and ** osteria — confused yet? And
likely at your neighborhood bar*.* Depending on whom you ask, bacaro **
comes from the Venetian word for “wine” or “a good bar,” or even from
the ancient Roman god of wine, Bacchus*.*

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Venetians eat cicchetti ** at breakfast time, for lunch, dinner and a
midnight snack — mostly with their fingers. It’s look-and-point food: no
special mastery of Italian required. And you don’t need to wait to be
seated to enjoy it. (That’s not even an option at some bacari*.*)
Cicchetti are cheap, costing on average a couple of euros — or dollars,
for that matter — apiece (a bit more for more substantial seafood or
meat cicchetti). Six to eight make a meal, and the local wines served by
the glass are affordable, too. There are few ways more delectable or fun
to get to know La Serenissima than by embarking on a bar crawl. Here are
some of my favorites*.*

Let Jiro dream of sushi. Alessandra De Respinis dreams of cicchetti. The
septuagenarian owner of [this hobbit-size
b](http://www.cantinaschiavi.com/)a[car](http://www.cantinaschiavi.com/)o
** in the artsy Dorsoduro District turns out these diminutive open-faced
sandwiches by the hundreds. And she constantly invents new ones, like a
cicchetto di castagna that plays the earthy sweetness of chestnut purée
against the creamy funk of robiola cheese. Or her gamberi in saór — a
shrimp riff on classic Venetian sweet and sour sardines piled on a
crusty slice of baguette.

“My customers would revolt if I stopped serving the tartare di tonno,”
said Ms. De Respinis of her caper- and brandy-laced chopped tuna dusted
with unsweetened cocoa powder. That surprising combination won her a
prize at a culinary contest in Mexico City. But Ms. De Respinis is no
globe-trotting chef: day in, day out, you’ll find her behind the bar,
white hair swept back, striped apron tied around her waist, with a gold
fork pinned to her blouse — a gift from a customer in homage to her
preferred cooking utensil. On a given day, già Schiavi serves 25 wines —
mostly from the Veneto — by the glass. I’m partial to the minerally
white Orto di Venezia, grown on the nearby island of Sant’Erasmo. Just
don’t expect to enjoy it sitting down. As Ms. De Respinis cautioned
about a meal at her cantina: “You eat, drink and pay standing up.”

## All’Arco

Matteo Pinto grates a fresh horseradish root so hard, you can hear it
rasp as the fiery shreds fall on bread slices topped with pink slices of
ham and caramelized onions. His father, Francesco Pinto, pours an ombra
(“shadow,” literally — glass of wine in local parlance) for a Rialto
fish merchant speaking Veneziano (a dialect quite distinct from Italian)
with a woman rocking a child in a baby carriage. If the Piazza San Marco
is Europe’s drawing room (to quote Napoleon),
[All’Arco](https://www.google.com/search?q=All%E2%80%99Arco&oq=All%E2%80%99Arco&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1342j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
is its neighborhood tavern. Situated in a maze of alleyways behind the
Rialto fish market, this has been a bacaro ** for more than a century,
explains All’Arco founder Francesco Pinto, who took over the one-room
bar in 1996. He started with a dozen cicchetti — classic porchetta **
sandwiches*,* for example, and crostini smeared with gorgonzola and
anchovies.

Today, you’ll find more than 30 in an ever-changing repertory of
hundreds. “We make our crostini by the minute, not by the hour,”
explained Matteo Pinto. “The freshness must be apparent in each bite.”
You don’t get much fresher than the season’s first canocchie,
supernaturally sweet mantis shrimp fresh from the Lagoon, served atop
tiny arugula leaves and tomatoes. In the winter, you’ll find heavier
fare, such as veal stracotto (stew) — piled on a crusty roll, ** like
some Venetian version of pulled pork. All’Arco takes its name from the
ancient stone arch facing the bar — said to symbolize the matrimonial
union of two neighboring households centuries ago. The bacaro fills
quickly, soustomers spill out to small tables lining the sidewalk. The
ambience is joyous and jovial — the perfect embodiment of a Venetian
institution designed not only to slake your thirst and assuage your
appetite, but also to build your sense of community. “We’ve lost so much
of our city,” Mr. Pinto said. “This is one of the places where Venetians
come to feel Venetian.”

## Osteria al Squero

Squero refers to a boatyard where gondolas are built or repaired. This
appropriately named osteria ** faces the Squero San Trovaso — one of the
last such working boatyards in Venice. Founded by two brothers
(Alessandro Vio runs the front of the house; Cristiano makes the
cicchetti), [Al Squero](https://osteriaalsquero.wordpress.com/) ** draws
an animated crowd of art students from the nearby Academia Museum and
tourists from around the planet. Wine bottles line the walls and
cicchetti sparkle in the showcase.

Of course, they serve the ubiquitous baccalà mantecato ** (salt cod
simmered in milk and whipped with oil to a snowy mousse) and sarde in
saór (sweet and sour sardines). But you’ll also find such decidedly
untraditional cicchetti as tissue-thin slices of lardo perfumed with
honey, rosemary and pink peppercorns, and crostini heaped with roasted
pumpkin, porcini and ricotta. There are meatless polpette ** for
vegetarians, and in a nod to the ecological concerns of young Venetians,
the cicchetti come on biodegradable plates. The Vio brothers specialize
in wines from northern Italy, including a particularly refreshing J.
Hoffstatter Gewürztraminer from the Alto Adige.

They’ve also upscaled Venice’s indispensable cocktail, the spritz, here
made with your choice of electric orange Aperol, ruby red Campari, or
bracingly bitter artichoke-based Cynar. If you really want to seem in
the know, order a mezzo e mezzo — prepared with half Aperol and half
Campari. All come festooned with a salty olive on a skewer instead of
the traditional orange slice.

## Cantina Do Spade

To embark on a cicchetti crawl in Venice without trying Do Spade’s
polpetta di spianata calabra ** would be like visiting San Marco and
overlooking the basilica. It’s a meatball, but, oh, what a meatball:
fiery Calabrian sausage mashed with smoked cheese ** and potatoes, and
lightly breaded and fried. “We wanted to open a cicchetteria that serves
more than open-faced sandwiches,” explained Francesco Munarini, a former
bank executive who opened [Do Spade](https://cantinadospade.com/) a
decade ago with his wife, Pilar, and sister, Giovanna. (The storefront
has housed an osteria since 1488.) Inspired by the Rialto fish market
nearby, the Munarini family decided to specialize in seafood seasoned
with the big-flavored spices that made the fortunes of Venetian traders
for centuries.

In quick succession, I downed calamari ripieni (tender squid stuffed
with olives and bread crumbs), fiori de zucca farciti con baccalà
mantecato ** (fried squash flowers filled with creamed codfish),
moscardini in umido ** (stewed baby octopus), la buzara ** (scampi
simmered in ginger- and pepper-piqued tomato sauce) and what may well be
the best sarde in saór in Venice. The local-leaning wine list is
ecumenical enough to include bottles from Istria, now part of Croatia,
but which belonged to Italy before World War II. Recognizable by the
crossed sabers in the window and spillover crowds in the alleyway, Do
Spade (“Two Swords”) offers seating in a warren of simply decorated blue
rooms, but most customers prefer to eat standing by the open kitchen or
in the street.

## Osteria Bancogiro

For half a millennium or so, Venice dominated Europe’s international
commerce, so it should come as no surprise that two modern financial
instruments originated here: the bancarotta (bankruptcy”—“broken bench,”
literally) and the bancogiro, bank transfer (named for the world’s first
publicly funded bank, founded in Venice in 1587). A lengthy introduction
to one of the most scenic barcari in Venice. Housed in a former
vegetable depot, [Bancogiro](https://www.osteriabancogiro.it/en/) is
part wine bar and part osteria (restaurant). Unlike most bacari, there’s
outdoor seating on a wide terrace situated directly on the Grand Canal.
(At lunch and dinner time, these tables are reserved for people who
order a full meal, so arrive early.) If the water were any closer, you’d
have to dine in a gondola (more on that in a minute).

Here, too, seafood figures prominently, from a luscious crostino of
piovra, lardo e melanzana ** (octopus, lardo and eggplant) to
Bancogiro’s signature ricotta salata con gamberi al curry (salted
ricotta and curried shrimp over a rectangle of creamy squid ink polenta)
— the latter popular with the gluten-free crowd. If cold cuts are your
thing, you’ll find artisanal mortadella from Bologna dotted with toasted
sweet pistachios, and crostini carpeted with lacy coppa ** (shoulder
ham) cured with Amarone wine.

On any given day, Bancogiro offers 17 wines by the glass, including a
house white blended from Garganega and Durella grapes. After your meal,
follow the signs to the nearby Traghetto Santa Sofia ** for a ride on
what I call a poor man’s gondola. Two euros gets you on an oversize
gondola across the Grand Canal in the company of Venetians with their
market bags. Gentlemen take note: It’s considered good manners for the
male passengers to remain standing.

## Basegò

Like most Venetians, Tobia Lenarda deplores mass tourism. So the
one-time conservatory pianist, recognizable by his salt-and-pepper beard
and red sneakers, chose a singular way to fight back: He opened a
new-school bacaro. “I toured the tapas bars in Spain and Portugal to get
ideas,” he said. “I researched sushi and Mexican street food.” He called
his venture Basegò, the Venetian dialect word for basil. “It’s clean,
it’s bright, it’s fresh — just like basil,” he said. Basegò doesn’t
look like your typical bacaro, not with pin spots casting a discrete
light on clean walls of exposed brick, natural wood and white plaster.
Wine barrels and wall shelves serve as tables, with the day’s selection
of wines written on a blackboard. The cicchetti are as fresh as the
décor. Tonno afumicato (smoked tuna) comes with avocado “mayonnaise.”
(“Think of it as Venetian guacamole,” said Mr. Lenarda.) Wasabi lights
up a salmon cicchetto. Gorgonzola comes with balsamic vinegar-marinated
strawberries.

Equal care goes into Basegò’s wines. “We try to work with heroic
vintners, who grow varieties and make wines no one bothers with any
more.” One such wine, Calzo della Vignia, comes from Giglio Island in
Tuscany. “The hills are so steep, they have to harvest the grapes on
foot and by hand,” Mr. Lenarda said. The result: a golden wine with an
earth taste so rich, you can almost chew it. Mr. Lenarda summed up his
view of customer service this way: “If you treat you customers politely
— and that includes tourists — they pay you back with courtesy.” He
thinks for a minute and paraphrases John F. Kennedy. “Ask not what
Venice can do for you. Ask what you can do for Venice.” The philosophy
earns high praise from the locals. The morning I was there, the only
languages I heard were Italian and Venetian.

## Bar 5000

Bacari specialize in wine, of course, and
[Bar 5000](http://www.lunasentada.it/home) takes that mandate seriously,
offering an impressive selection of vino bio, vino biodinámico and vino
vegano. The first is organic wine (made from grapes grown without
chemical fertilizers or fungicides), while the second are wines vinified
without supplemental yeast or other additives. As for vegan wines,
they’re clarified without gelatin, a fining agent derived from animal
bones. And all three are available on a 120-bottle list at this
new-school wine bar, located on the tranquil Campo San Severo in the
Castello District near Piazza San Marco. Gone, the mosh pit crowds of
the Rialto bacari. The clean modern interior runs to up-lit brick walls,
polished concrete floors, and a chandelier blown by the Murano glass
master Fabio Fornasier. Weather permitting, you can sit at one of a
handful of tables along the quiet Severno canal.

When it comes to the cicchetti, Bar 5000 may lack the jaw-dropping
variety of All’Arco or già Schiavi, but the six to eight daily
selections in the showcase are thoughtfully chosen and well prepared. A
plump salty sun-dried tomato crowns a crostino of sopressata cut
paper-thin on a Berker meat slicer. Fresh oranges and mostarda (fruit
jam) counterpoint a tiny wedge of Monte Veronese cheese. The pickles
come from vegetables grown on Sant’Erasmo Island. “We bake our own bread
daily,” said Micael Nordio. co-owner of Bar 5000. “We don’t have a
freezer, so you know our food is fresh.” Twice a month, Bar 5000 stages
wine dinners, often with live music. If you’re still hungry after the
cicchetti, you can go for a proper meal at the sister restaurant, Luna
Sentada, next door.
