``Get ready for a lot of rules,'' says Carli Jones, a court clerk from
Kansas whose boyfriend of two years is serving a life sentence in an
Ohio prison. Look online to find the regulations dictating what you can
send, wear, say and do inside your loved one's prison. Jones, 32, writes
her boyfriend five-page letters almost daily and talks to him by phone
and video chat multiple times a week. She sent her first letter to a
prisoner as a college assignment; she wrote to the man who is now her
boyfriend after graduation, and within weeks the two were in love.
Fifteen months later, they met for the first time in a visitation room
and were allowed one kiss and one hug.

Prison staff censor or monitor all communication and prohibit sexually
explicit language and contact. Build intimacy by chronicling and sharing
other parts of your life. Jones often takes a photo of her shopping cart
at the grocery store, for example, and sends it to her boyfriend. She'll
never wake up next to him, but she can ask him to describe the minutiae
of his morning routine. ``You have to work on your communication,'' she
says, ``because it's pretty much all you have.''

Your financial contributions will most likely be unequal. Many prisoners
work, but wages can be less than 20 cents an hour. Jones transfers about
\$100 a month to her boyfriend's account so he can buy food and supplies
from the prison commissary, as well as credits for phone calls. ``It's
your choice if you want to help them out financially,'' she says.

Almost everyone will ask about your partner's crime. Don't feel obliged
to share that information. ``It's important to know that you're not
alone,'' says Jones, who volunteers with the support group Strong Prison
Wives \& Families. Dating a prisoner, she says, will change your
assumptions about the 2.2 million people currently incarcerated in the
United States. Jones studied criminology and for a long time conceived
of the criminal-justice system as good law enforcement versus bad
people. Love muddled that equation. ``These aren't just criminals on
paper,'' she says. ``These are fathers, brothers and sons, and they want
to love and be loved just like the rest of us.''
