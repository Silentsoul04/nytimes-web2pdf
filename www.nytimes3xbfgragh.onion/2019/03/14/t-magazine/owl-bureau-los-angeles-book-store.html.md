The joy of printed books, according to Richard Christiansen, founder of
the ad agency [Chandelier
Creative](https://www.chandeliercreative.com/), “is that you really feel
as though you can wrap your arms around craft and culture in the world —
to really appreciate not just what’s in those books, but the craft and
skill that goes into making them.” He vividly recalls the transformative
effect that Madonna’s 1992 coffee table book, “Sex,” had on him as a
teenager. Edited by Glenn O’Brien and photographed by Steven Meisel —
“amazing luminaries I had no idea of at the time” — it offered him a
glimpse outside his sheltered upbringing in rural Australia. “I remember
thinking, oh my god, I want to be able to create work like that. I want
to be part of that world.”

Fast forward to our current digital age, and Christiansen still believes
in the power of print. This week he opens his own bookstore, Owl Bureau,
in Highland Park, a northeast Los Angeles neighborhood not far from the
[hillside
home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/14/t-magazine/los-angeles-dream-house-flamingo-estate.html)
he bought in 2013. On Figueroa Street, where trendy new coffee shops
have recently joined the longstanding mix of mom-and-pop storefronts, it
shares space with Chandelier Creative’s Los Angeles outpost inside a
former pharmacy called Owl Drugs, which is still complete with its
original
signage.

Inside, the Los Angeles-based designers Waka Waka and Machinehistories
have erected a curved wall of blond California wood where the books rest
on shelves and wooden pegs. Christiansen, with the Paris-based
architects [Studio
KO](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/23/t-magazine/minimalism-design-studio-ko.html),
conceived of a fanciful shrine to print media, culminating in a pair of
doors ornately carved with reliefs of owls, cactuses and bumblebees (the
office is just on the other side). The inventory, curated in
collaboration with [Mast Books](https://www.mastbooks.com/), is a mix of
new titles in art, fashion, architecture and design, plus 200 or so from
Christiansen’s personal collection. Madonna’s “Sex,” is there, alongside
other rare gems that include Herb Ritts’s “Notorious” celebrity
portraits and the kitsch catalog to Karl Lagerfeld’s 1991 Sotheby’s
auction of Memphis furniture.

Christiansen sees the space as a place to host book and magazine
launches, signings and readings, like an evening with the French
architectural photographer François Halard, who will be signing a few
rare publications at the shop’s opening on Saturday. Owl Bureau will
also host an artist residency on site (the first artist will be ceramist
Alex Reed) and will eventually even serve coffee. For Christiansen, the
space also fulfills a personal need for a store he felt had been lacking
— a place to buy a copy of French Vogue within a 45-minute drive from
his house.

As for the books he will be selling from his personal collection, he
says: “I almost feel like they’ve been my best friends; I have turned to
them when I’ve needed inspiration, and when I’ve needed solace.” But he
doesn’t feel a shred of sadness about parting ways. “Hopefully they can
end up in someone’s hand who pores over every page like I did, and does
something great with where it takes them.”

*Starting Monday, March 18, Owl Bureau will be open seven days a week,
from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., at 5634 N. Figueroa Street, Los Angeles.*
