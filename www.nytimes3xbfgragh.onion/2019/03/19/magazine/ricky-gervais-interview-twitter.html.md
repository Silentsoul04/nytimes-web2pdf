Since Ricky Gervais’s 2001 hit “The Office” — which was at once
hilarious, cringe-worthy and divisive — the comedian has cemented
himself in the space where comedy might make you a little uncomfortable.
“Anything you do that’s the slightest bit interesting,” he said, “as
many people are going to hate it as love it.” [He talked to David
Marchese about<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>provocation,
picking targets and outrage
culture.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/03/19/magazine/ricky-gervais-after-life-comedy-twitter.html)
Here are six things we learned.

**Gervais uses Twitter to look for material.** His 13 million Twitter
followers allow him to see a “cross-section of society a thousand times
faster than I could’ve otherwise.” He’ll ask them questions like,
“What’s a subject you should never joke about?” and can come up with
some jokes that way, sometimes just reading out the responses. It’s
funny, he maintains, because you think about the one person who would be
angry about the joke. “The audience has got to be clever enough to know
when I’m playing the idiot and saying the wrong thing for comic effect.
That’s one of the things of comedy: laughing at the wrong thing because
you know what the right thing is.”

**Even his more offensive jokes work because they’re so sophisticated.**
During his “Humanity” special, Gervais made a joke that begins with a
celebrity killing a person with a car and ends in wanting to
self-identify as a chimp named Bobo. Still, Gervais maintains that his
audience is logical enough to get it. “I become the idiot who believes
that being transgender is the same as changing into a chimp,” he told
Marchese. “But I have to do the joke like I mean it for it to work.” He
continued, “Most people haven’t got the time to analyze the jokes, and I
go in and out of the parody too fast for some. But as long as I know the
target and some people get it and agree with me, I think the jokes are
justified.”

**He wants people to know he’s a nice guy.** As a comedian and actor who
achieved fame for socially awkward characters like David Brent in “The
Office,” Gervais tries to be self-aware in his real life. “I do ironic
jokes in my social life. All people do that when they joke with each
other, and they don’t have to explain themselves. Whereas you do feel
the need to explain jokes to strangers.”

**It’s perfectly fine for awards shows to be political.** “Despite what
people think of me, I’m not judgmental at all,” Gervais said. He walks
both sides of this argument — that Hollywood can take itself too
seriously or that, say, President Trump shouldn’t care about Hollywood.
He’s able to strike this balance, he says, because he keeps his politics
out of the show; if you rely on an audience to agree with you, you lose
something. “Comedy is an intellectual pursuit, not an emotional one.”

**He has complicated feelings on cancel culture.** “If people don’t
accept a person’s apology for a mistake, there’s no value in that person
trying to improve,” he told Marchese, regarding the recent backlash
against Kevin Hart’s being offered to host the Oscars after some of his
old jokes were thought to be homophobic. Gervais hates virtue signaling,
which, to him, allows people to show off how great they are. Canceling
someone should depend on a lot of things: the deed, the accusation, the
time, how much you liked them. “The Louis C.K. thing — is he allowed to
gig? Yeah, he is. Are people allowed to protest? Yeah, they are. But you
can’t change history.”

**Not everyone likes “The Office.”** “Some people hate it,” he told
Marchese, “which is comforting.”
