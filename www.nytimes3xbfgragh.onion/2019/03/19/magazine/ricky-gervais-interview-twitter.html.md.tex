Since Ricky Gervais's 2001 hit ``The Office'' --- which was at once
hilarious, cringe-worthy and divisive --- the comedian has cemented
himself in the space where comedy might make you a little uncomfortable.
``Anything you do that's the slightest bit interesting,'' he said, ``as
many people are going to hate it as love it.''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/03/19/magazine/ricky-gervais-after-life-comedy-twitter.html}{He
talked to David Marchese about provocation, picking targets and outrage
culture.} Here are six things we learned.

\textbf{Gervais uses Twitter to look for material.} His 13 million
Twitter followers allow him to see a ``cross-section of society a
thousand times faster than I could've otherwise.'' He'll ask them
questions like, ``What's a subject you should never joke about?'' and
can come up with some jokes that way, sometimes just reading out the
responses. It's funny, he maintains, because you think about the one
person who would be angry about the joke. ``The audience has got to be
clever enough to know when I'm playing the idiot and saying the wrong
thing for comic effect. That's one of the things of comedy: laughing at
the wrong thing because you know what the right thing is.''

\textbf{Even his more offensive jokes work because they're so
sophisticated.} During his ``Humanity'' special, Gervais made a joke
that begins with a celebrity killing a person with a car and ends in
wanting to self-identify as a chimp named Bobo. Still, Gervais maintains
that his audience is logical enough to get it. ``I become the idiot who
believes that being transgender is the same as changing into a chimp,''
he told Marchese. ``But I have to do the joke like I mean it for it to
work.'' He continued, ``Most people haven't got the time to analyze the
jokes, and I go in and out of the parody too fast for some. But as long
as I know the target and some people get it and agree with me, I think
the jokes are justified.''

\textbf{He wants people to know he's a nice guy.} As a comedian and
actor who achieved fame for socially awkward characters like David Brent
in ``The Office,'' Gervais tries to be self-aware in his real life. ``I
do ironic jokes in my social life. All people do that when they joke
with each other, and they don't have to explain themselves. Whereas you
do feel the need to explain jokes to strangers.''

\textbf{It's perfectly fine for awards shows to be political.} ``Despite
what people think of me, I'm not judgmental at all,'' Gervais said. He
walks both sides of this argument --- that Hollywood can take itself too
seriously or that, say, President Trump shouldn't care about Hollywood.
He's able to strike this balance, he says, because he keeps his politics
out of the show; if you rely on an audience to agree with you, you lose
something. ``Comedy is an intellectual pursuit, not an emotional one.''

\textbf{He has complicated feelings on cancel culture.} ``If people
don't accept a person's apology for a mistake, there's no value in that
person trying to improve,'' he told Marchese, regarding the recent
backlash against Kevin Hart's being offered to host the Oscars after
some of his old jokes were thought to be homophobic. Gervais hates
virtue signaling, which, to him, allows people to show off how great
they are. Canceling someone should depend on a lot of things: the deed,
the accusation, the time, how much you liked them. ``The Louis C.K.
thing --- is he allowed to gig? Yeah, he is. Are people allowed to
protest? Yeah, they are. But you can't change history.''

\textbf{Not everyone likes ``The Office.''} ``Some people hate it,'' he
told Marchese, ``which is comforting.''
