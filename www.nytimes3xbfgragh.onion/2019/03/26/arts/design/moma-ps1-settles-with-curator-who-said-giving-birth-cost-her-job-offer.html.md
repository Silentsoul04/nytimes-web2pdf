A curator who accused MoMA PS 1 of [gender, pregnancy and caregiver
discrimination](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/06/arts/design/moma-ps1-discrimination-suit-baby.html)has
settled the claim she brought against the museum saying it had rescinded
a job offer upon learning she had recently given birth.

Nikki Columbus, who is also an art editor, filed the claim in July 2018
with the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The settlement, made
public by the law firm that represented Ms. Columbus, Emery Celli
Brinckerhoff & Abady, includes financial compensation for Ms. Columbus
as well an agreement by the contemporary art museum in Queens to update
its written policies designed to protect women, working parents and
other caregivers who apply for jobs or work there.

“What happened to me was wrong and clearly against the law,” Ms.
Columbus said in a statement on Tuesday. “I decided to speak out in
order to protect other women at MoMA PS1 and beyond.”

The financial terms were not disclosed, but Ms. Columbus said in an
interview that she made it a point that her agreement not bar her from
discussing other details of the case.

“That was really central to me, that I could talk about the importance
of the suit,” she said.

Ms. Columbus said she has not been able to find full-time work since the
PS1 offer, to be the museum’s associate curator of performance, was
withdrawn.

Elizabeth S. Saylor, one of Ms. Columbus’s lawyers, said in a statement,
“We hope that more people will follow Ms. Columbus’s lead and take
advantage of the robust protections that NYC law provides.” Ms. Saylor
is also co-chairwoman of the board of [A Better
Balance](https://www.abetterbalance.org/), a nonprofit that focuses on
improving work-life balance conditions, and was co-counsel on the claim.

Her claim named MoMA PS1 and its chief curator Peter Eleey, chief
operating officer Jose A. Ortiz and then-director Klaus Biesenbach.

“MoMA PS1 at all times has been compliant with the law and remains
committed to supporting women and caregivers,” a museum spokeswoman said
Tuesday. “We are satisfied with the agreement and are happy to put this
matter behind us.”

MoMA PS1 has not named a performance curator; its performance program is
overseen by two assistant curators. Mr. Biesenbach is now director of
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.

Ms. Columbus said friends had worried that her claim might lead to her
being ostracized professionally. But, she said, “I received many private
messages of support from people across the art world, friends, people I
didn’t know, including people who work at MoMA, thanking me for coming
forward.”

Still, not many people voiced their support publicly, she said. “I think
that reflects MoMA’s power within the art world, and the fact that there
have been so few stories like mine,” she said.

Pregnancy discrimination is common across [many
industries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/06/15/business/pregnancy-discrimination.html),
and even Planned Parenthood has been criticized for how it [treats its
pregnant
employees](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/20/business/planned-parenthood-pregnant-employee-discrimination-women.html).
“I decided that I needed to call it out, and I think people weren’t
expecting that,” Ms. Columbus said, “and I think that women themselves
don’t realize that they can do that.”

She added: “I hope that this shows that it’s possible to hold the art
world to account.”
