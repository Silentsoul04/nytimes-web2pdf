“If you’re talking to a puppy, increase the pitch of your voice and slow
the tempo,” says Mario Gallego-Abenza, a cognitive biologist and an
author of a recent study analyzing canine response to human speech.
People tend to use that high-register, baby-talk tone with all dogs, but
it’s really only puppies under a year old that seem to like it. “With
older dogs, just use your normal voice,” he says.

Dogs can learn words. One well-studied [border collie named
Rico](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1682) knew 200
objects by name and, like a toddler, could infer the names of novel
objects by excluding things with labels he already knew. Use facial
expressions, gestures and possibly food treats while you talk. “Maintain
eye contact,” Gallego-Abenza says. Research shows that even wolves are
attuned to the attention of human faces and that dogs are particularly
receptive to your gaze and pointing gestures. Scientists disagree about
whether dogs are capable of full-blown empathy, but studies suggest
canines feel at least a form of primitive empathy known as “emotional
contagion.” [In one
study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486498/), dogs that
heard recordings of infants crying experienced the same spike in
cortisol levels and alertness as their human counterparts.

You might find yourself wondering: Is this dog even listening to me?
Does it care? Look for the sorts of social cues you would seek in an
attentive human listener. “Is the dog looking at you?” Gallego-Abenza
says. “Is it getting closer?” You are a social animal; connection with
other social animals can make you feel better about the world.
Gallego-Abenza, no longer studying dogs, is now working on a doctorate
at the University of Vienna focused on vocalizations between ravens.
Last year, a couple contacted him, sure that they were able to converse
with the birds in their garden. “Humans have this rich language, and we
really want to communicate,” he says. “We think that every other animal
is the same, but they’re not.” Go ahead and talk to dogs, but consider
letting wild creatures alone to their own intraspecies squeaks, howls
and whispers.
