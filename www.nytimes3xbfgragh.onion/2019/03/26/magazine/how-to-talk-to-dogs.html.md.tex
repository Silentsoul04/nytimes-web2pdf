``If you're talking to a puppy, increase the pitch of your voice and
slow the tempo,'' says Mario Gallego-Abenza, a cognitive biologist and
an author of a recent study analyzing canine response to human speech.
People tend to use that high-register, baby-talk tone with all dogs, but
it's really only puppies under a year old that seem to like it. ``With
older dogs, just use your normal voice,'' he says.

Dogs can learn words. One well-studied
\href{http://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1682}{border collie
named Rico} knew 200 objects by name and, like a toddler, could infer
the names of novel objects by excluding things with labels he already
knew. Use facial expressions, gestures and possibly food treats while
you talk. ``Maintain eye contact,'' Gallego-Abenza says. Research shows
that even wolves are attuned to the attention of human faces and that
dogs are particularly receptive to your gaze and pointing gestures.
Scientists disagree about whether dogs are capable of full-blown
empathy, but studies suggest canines feel at least a form of primitive
empathy known as ``emotional contagion.''
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486498/}{In one
study}, dogs that heard recordings of infants crying experienced the
same spike in cortisol levels and alertness as their human counterparts.

You might find yourself wondering: Is this dog even listening to me?
Does it care? Look for the sorts of social cues you would seek in an
attentive human listener. ``Is the dog looking at you?'' Gallego-Abenza
says. ``Is it getting closer?'' You are a social animal; connection with
other social animals can make you feel better about the world.
Gallego-Abenza, no longer studying dogs, is now working on a doctorate
at the University of Vienna focused on vocalizations between ravens.
Last year, a couple contacted him, sure that they were able to converse
with the birds in their garden. ``Humans have this rich language, and we
really want to communicate,'' he says. ``We think that every other
animal is the same, but they're not.'' Go ahead and talk to dogs, but
consider letting wild creatures alone to their own intraspecies squeaks,
howls and whispers.
