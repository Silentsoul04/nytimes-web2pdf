How is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943
musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie? The
answer arrives before the first song is over in Daniel Fish’s
wide-awake, jolting and altogether wonderful production of [“Rodgers and
Hammerstein’s Oklahoma\!,” which opened on Sunday night at the Circle in
the Square
Theater](https://oklahomabroadway.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-bj_vbO54QIViI3ICh2_HA6aEAAYASAAEgJEdvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

“Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” is the title and the opening line of this
familiar number, a paean to a land of promisingly blue skies and open
spaces. But Curly, the cowboy who sings it, isn’t cushioned by the
expected lush orchestrations. Nor is the actor playing him your usual
solid slab of beefcake with a strapping tenor.

As embodied by the excellent Damon Daunno, this lad of the prairies is
wiry and wired, so full of unchanneled sexual energy you expect him to
implode. There’s the hint of a wobble in his cocky strut and voice.

Doing his best to project a confidence he doesn’t entirely feel, to the
accompaniment of a down-home guitar, he seems so palpably young. As is
often true of big boys with unsettled hormones, he also reads as just a
little dangerous.

He’s a lot like the feisty, ever-evolving nation he’s so proud to belong
to. That would be the United States of America, then and now.

[Making his Broadway debut as a director, Mr.
Fish](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/27/theater/daniel-fish-oklahoma.html)
has reconceived a work often seen as a byword for can-do optimism as a
mirror for our age of doubt and anxiety. This is “Oklahoma\!” for an era
in which longstanding American legacies are being examined with newly
skeptical eyes.

Such a metamorphosis has been realized with scarcely a changed word of
Oscar Hammerstein II’s original book and lyrics. This isn’t an act of
plunder, but of reclamation. And a cozy old friend starts to seem like a
figure of disturbing — and exciting — depth and complexity.

Mr. Fish’s version isn’t the first “Oklahoma\!” to elicit the shadows
from within the play’s sunshine. Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman’s
[interpretation for London’s National Theater of nearly two decades
ago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/03/22/movies/theater-review-this-time-a-beautiful-mornin-with-a-dark-side.html),
while more traditionally staged, also scaled up the disquieting erotic
elements.

But this latest incarnation goes much further in digging to a core of
fraught ambivalence. To do so, it strips “Oklahoma\!” down to its
skivvies, discarding the picturesque costumes and swirling
orchestrations, and revealing a very human body that belongs to our
conflicted present as much as it did to 1943 or to 1906, the year in
which the show (based on [Lynn Riggs’s “Green Grow the
Lilacs”)](http://thislandpress.com/2014/04/30/broadways-forgotten-man/)
takes place.

\[*What’s new onstage and off:[Sign up for our Theater Update
newsletter.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/theater-update?module=inline)*\]

Laura Jellinek’s set suggests a small-town community center that might
double as a polling station, decorated with festive banners, colored
lights — and a full arsenal of guns on the walls. It’s made clear that
we the audience are part of this community. The house lights stay on for
much of the show, in a homogenizing brightness, that is occasionally and
abruptly changed for pitch darkness. (Scott Zielinski is the first-rate
lighting designer.)

There’s chili cooking on the refectory tables onstage, for the
audience’s consumption at intermission. A seven-member
hootenanny-style band sits in plain view. The well-known melodies they
play have been reimagined — by the brilliant orchestrator and arranger
Daniel Kluger — with the vernacular throb and straightforwardness of
country and western ballads.

The cast members — wearing a lot of good old, form-fitting denim (Terese
Wadden did the costumes) — are just plain folks. Singing with
conversational ease, they occasionally flirt and joke with the audience
seated on either side of the stage. We are all, it would appear, in this
together.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though the cast has been whittled down to 11 speaking parts (and one
dancer), the key characters are very much present. They include our
scrapping leading lovers, Curly McLain and Laurey Williams (Rebecca
Naomi Jones); their comic counterparts, Will Parker (James Davis) and
Ado Annie (Ali Stroker); that bastion of homespun wisdom and stoicism,
Aunt Eller (Mary Testa) and the womanizing peddler Ali Hakim (Will
Brill).

Oh, I almost forgot poor old Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill), the slightly,
well, weird handyman who’s sweet, in a sour way, on Laurey. Everybody
forgets Jud, or tries to. Not that this is possible, with Mr. Vaill
lending a charismatic, hungry loneliness to the part that’s guaranteed
to haunt your nightmares.

These people — in some cases nontraditionally yet always perfectly cast
— intersect much as they usually do in “Oklahoma\!” They court and
spark, fight and reunite. They also show off by picking up guitars and
microphones and dancing like prairie bacchantes. (John Heginbotham did
the spontaneous-feeling choreography.) They use household chores, like
shucking corn, to memorably annotative effect.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Stroker’s boy-crazy, country siren-voiced Ado Annie, who rides a
wheelchair as if it were a prize bronco, and Mr. Davis’s deliciously
dumb Will emanate a blissful endorphin haze. Mr. Brill is a refreshingly
unmannered Ali Hakim, and Ms. Testa is a splendid, wryly authoritative
Aunt Eller.

But there’s an abiding tension. This is especially evident in Ms.
Jones’s affectingly wary Laurey, who regards her very different
suitors, Curly and Jud, with a confused combination of desire and
terror.

That her fears are not misplaced becomes clear in an encounter in Jud’s
dank hovel of a home. Curly sings “Pore Jud,” in which he teasingly
imagines his rival’s funeral with an ominous breathiness.

The scene occurs in darkness, with a simulcast video in black and white
of the two men face to face. (Joshua Thorson did the projection design.)
And the lines between sex and violence, already blurred in this
gun-toting universe, melt altogether.

I first saw Mr. Fish’s “Oklahoma\!” [at Bard College
in 2015](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/07/theater/review-oklahoma-preserves-a-classic-while-adding-punch.html),
and again [at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn last
year.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/07/theater/oklahoma-review.html)
It was an exciting work from the get-go, but it just keeps getting
better. The performances are looser and bigger; they’re Broadway-size
now, with all the infectious exuberance you expect from a great musical.

At the same time, though, this production reminds us that such raw
energy can be harnessed to different ends, for ill as well as for good.
In the earlier versions, I had problems with its truly shocking
conclusion — the scene that takes the most liberties with the original.
In its carefully retooled rendering, it’s disturbing for all the right
reasons.

The other significant change here involves the dream ballet, which in
this version begins the second act and has been newly varied and paced.
It is performed by one dancer (the exquisite Gabrielle Hamilton) with a
shaved head and a glittering T-shirt that reads “Dream Baby Dream.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What she does is a far cry from the same sequence as immortalized by
Agnes de Mille, the show’s legendary original choreographer. But on its
own, radically reconceptualized terms, it achieves the same effect.

As she gallops, slithers and crawls the length of the stage, casting
wondering and seductive glances at the front row, Ms. Hamilton comes to
seem like undiluted id incarnate, a force that has always been rippling
beneath the surface here.

She’s as stimulating and frightening — and as fresh — as last night’s
fever dream. So is this astonishing show.
