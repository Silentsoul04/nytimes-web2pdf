PUBLIC SERVICE

## The South Florida Sun Sentinel

The Sun Sentinel’s sweeping coverage of the causes and consequences of
the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in
Parkland, Fla., shaped the national gun safety debate and prompted
changes in local policies. The paper addressed a [culture of
leniency](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-florida-school-shooting-discipline-20180510-story.html)
at Broward County schools, blunders by the sheriff’s office in
[responding to the
attack](http://projects.sun-sentinel.com/2018/sfl-parkland-school-shooting-critical-moments/)
and attempts by officials to [mask their
failures](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-florida-school-shooting-district-secrecy-20181112-story.html).

**Finalists** ProPublica, The Washington Post

BREAKING NEWS REPORTING

## Staff of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

“I don’t think there’s a single person on the staff who didn’t
contribute” to covering the shooting deaths of 11 worshipers at the Tree
of Life synagogue, said Keith Burris, the paper’s executive editor. A
[visceral
account](https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/pittsburgh-squirrel-hill-synagogue-massacre/)
of the attack began with the first words of the Mourners’ Kaddish, a
Jewish prayer for the dead, rendered in Hebrew. Other articles examined
the victims’ lives, the [harrowing

The Los Angeles Times was honored for a [series of
articles](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-times-pulitzer-george-tyndall-usc-20190414-story.html)
that exposed a pattern of abuse by a University of Southern California

hundreds of students at a campus clinic over the course of three decades
The allegations led to the resignation of the university’s president and
prompted local, state and federal investigations.

EXPLANATORY REPORTING

## David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner  
of The New York Times

The [18-month
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?module=inline)
of President Trump’s finances debunked his claims of self-made wealth
and revealed a business empire "riddled with tax dodges," the Pulitzer
committee said. The series led city and state officials in New York to
open investigations into whether Mr. Trump and his family had underpaid
taxes on his father’s real estate empire and participated in fraudulent
tax schemes. This is the fourth Pulitzer for Mr. Barstow; Ms. Craig, 51,
and Mr. Buettner, 57, have been finalists.

## Staff of The Advocate, Baton Rouge, La.

The Advocate was honored for its
[investigation](https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/courts/article_a03f02d2-fcf5-11e8-937c-fb85ceb6d9d3.html)
of a Louisiana law that allowed juries to convict defendants without
unanimous verdicts. In the series' [first
installation](https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/courts/article_16fd0ece-32b1-11e8-8770-33eca2a325de.html),
the reporters revealed how the framers of the state’s Constitution noted
explicitly that the law would perpetuate “the supremacy of the
Anglo-Saxon race in Louisiana." After the series appeared, Louisiana
voters amended their Constitution to require unanimous verdicts. "It
seemed to help turn the tide," said Gordon Russell, one of the reporters
on the series.

**Finalists** Barbara Laker, Wendy Ruderman, Dylan Purcell and Jessica
Griffin of The Philadelphia Inquirer; Brandon Stahl, Jennifer Bjorhus,
MaryJo Webster and Renée Jones Schneider of the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis, Minn.

NATIONAL REPORTING

## Staff of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal won the national reporting prize for its
[articles on hush money
payments](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-hush-money-11545349433?mod=article_inline)
made to two women who claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that
they had sexual encounters with Donald J. Trump. “To see the story
unfold the way it did and reach the president was just incredible,” said
Michael Rothfeld, one of The Journal reporters who contributed to the
coverage. “For me, it's just the story of a lifetime.”

INTERNATIONAL
REPORTING

## Maggie Michael, Maad al-Zikry and Nariman El-Mofty  
of Associated Press; Staff of Reuters, with notable contributions from Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo

The Reuters staff and two reporters specifically were honored for
“[expertly
exposing](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/myanmar-rohingya/)
the military units and Buddhist villagers responsible for the systematic
expulsion and murder of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar.” The reporters,
Wa Lone, 33, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, were arrested in December 2017 and
later sentenced to [seven years in
prison](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/03/world/asia/myanmar-reuters-journalists-sentenced-trial.html)
for reporting on the atrocities. Stephen J. Adler, Reuters’ top editor,
said he was “thrilled” for the recognition, but “deeply distressed” that
they reporters were still imprisoned.

Ms. Michael, Mr. al-Zikry and Ms. El-Mofty won for [their
series](https://apnews.com/YemenDirtyWar) “detailing the atrocities of
the war in Yemen, including theft of food aid, deployment of child
soldiers and torture of prisoners.” The journalists documented, in text,
video and photography, the civilian deaths caused by United States
drones and interviewed torture victims in Yemen’s civil war. Ms. Michael
[told](https://apnews.com/44f2f36b0c7b46b19b2fa32e6904b06c) The
Associated Press that she and her colleagues were “very happy to be able
to draw some attention” to the story.

**Finalist** Rukmini Callimachi of The New York Times

FEATURE WRITING

## Hannah Dreier of ProPublica

Ms. Dreier’s detailed portraits of [Salvadoran
immigrants](https://www.propublica.org/series/ms-13-on-long-island) were
cited for exposing how their lives had been destroyed “by a botched
federal crackdown on the international criminal gang MS-13.” After Ms.
Dreier, 32, heard President Trump tie immigration to gang violence, her
reporting revealed that immigrants were often victims of the crime
groups. “What was so cruel was that this population was being preyed
upon,” she said. The series was published jointly with The New York
Times Magazine, Newsday and New York magazine.

**Finalists** Deanna Pan and Jennifer Berry Hawes of The Post and
Courier, Charleston, S.C., and Elizabeth Bruenig of The Washington Post

COMMENTARY

## Tony Messenger of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch

Mr. Messenger, The Post-Dispatch’s metro columnist, was cited for a
[series of
pieces](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/post-dispatch-columnist-tony-messenger-wins-pulitzer-prize/article_ef22909b-12a9-510c-802f-48d0a66cb16c.html)
that exposed how poor people convicted of misdemeanor crimes were
charged fees for their time in jail, sometimes leading to years of debt
and further imprisonment. The columns resulted in a ruling by the
Missouri Supreme Court that the practice was illegal, although Mr.
Messenger, 52, said it persists. In an interview, he called it “a story
of human tragedy.”

**Finalists** Caitlin Flanagan of The Atlantic*;* Melinda Henneberger of
The Kansas City Star

CRITICISM

## Carlos Lozada of The Washington Post

Mr. Lozada, 47, The Post’s [nonfiction book
critic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/carlos-lozada), won for
reviews and essays on politics, truth, immigration and American identity
in the Trump era. In an interview, he called it “an irony of the time”
that a president with seemingly few literary interests had fueled such a
publishing explosion of topical work. “It’s a really rich time to dig in
to books as means to understand what is going on right now,” he said.

EDITORIAL WRITING

## Brent Staples of The New York Times

Mr. Staples, a member of The Times’s editorial board, was cited for his
writing on racial justice and culture, including pieces about how the
suffrage movement betrayed black women, Southern newspapers’ role in
lynchings and the Afrofuturism behind the movie “Black Panther.”

In [a collection of his
work](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/15/opinion/brent-staples-pulitzer-prize.html)
published on Monday, The Times wrote that Mr. Staples, 67, “has sought
to correct the parts of the national narrative on race that have been
sanitized and distorted.”

**Finalists** The **** editorial board of The Advocate in Baton Rouge,
La., and the editorial board of The Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md.

EDITORIAL CARTOONING

## Darrin Bell, freelancer

Mr. Bell, whose [work](http://darrinbell.com/) is syndicated by King
Features, won for cartoons that addressed racial injustice and political
turmoil surrounding the Trump administration. He was cited for “calling
out lies, hypocrisy and fraud.” He is the first African-American winner
in the category, a Pulitzer spokeswoman confirmed. “All the nights I
called home and told my wife and kids I had to stay at the office to
cover something that just happened were not for nothing,” he said in an
email.

## Photography Staff of Reuters

The photography staff of Reuters won the prize for breaking news
photography for its [series of
photos](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/reuters-wins-pulitzer-prize-for-migrant-idUSRTX6RS1A)
titled “On the Migrant Trail to America.” Taken by 11 photographers, the
winning images, inventive and heart-wrenching in equal measure, conveyed
the violent conditions that Central American migrants were leaving
behind in their homelands, and the harsh response they received from the
authorities when they got to the United States.

FEATURE PHOTOGRAPHY

## Lorenzo Tugnoli of The Washington Post

Some of the pictures Lorenzo Tugnoli, 39, [has taken in
Yemen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/amp-stories/photos-of-war-in-yemen/)
could be from anywhere: a young girl having her height measured, veiled
women in a classroom. That these images alternate with photos of
starving infants and armed men in camouflage only heightens their
impact. In an interview, Mr. Tugnoli said he had tried to balance
depictions of the extent and immediacy of the tragedy with pictures that
displayed deep respect for their subjects’ everyday lives.

**Finalists** Craig F. Walker of The Boston Globe; ** Maggie Steber and
Lynn Johnson of National Geographic

FICTION

## The Overstory by Richard Powers (W.W. Norton)

Mr. Powers, 61, is known as a brainy novelist, but “[The
Overstory](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/09/books/review/overstory-richard-powers.html)”
tested even his intellectual capacity: Its central characters are trees.
The environmental plot involves humans, but also communication occurring
in nature. Mr. Powers called the Pulitzer Prize “an astonishing
recognition,” and he said the reception to the novel proved to him that
readers were “hungry for a story that takes the nonhuman seriously, and
tries to reconnect the human to a world we’re so alienated from.”

**Finalists** “The Great Believers,” by Rebecca Makkai (Viking Books);
“There There,” by Tommy Orange (Alfred A. Knopf)

DRAMA

## Fairview by Jackie Sibblies Drury

Ms. Drury’s [dazzling
play](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/17/theater/review-theater-as-sabotage-in-the-dazzling-fairview.html)
appears at first to be a family comedy, but subverts expectations with a
head-spinning shift in content and form that forces theatergoers to
think in new ways about race and the white gaze. Ms. Drury, 37, said she
was trying “to communicate to white people what it’s like walking around
in a body of color and having people judge you.” The play, which debuted
last year at Soho Rep, will return in June [at Theater for a New
Audience](https://www.tfana.org/current-season/fairview/overview).

HISTORY

## Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom by David W. Blight (Simon & Schuster)

Mr. Blight, a professor at Yale University, was cited for “a
breathtaking history” that traced Douglass’s transformation from runaway
slave to one of the most profound thinkers on race, equality and
American identity. [Mr. Blight](http://www.davidwblight.com/), 70, began
the book 12 years ago after encountering a private collection of
Douglass manuscripts assembled by a retired African-American surgeon in
Savannah, Ga. “What does it mean to be an American?” Professor Blight
said. “Nobody has had more to say about that than Douglass.”

**Finalists** “Civilizing Torture: An American Tradition,” by W.
Fitzhugh Brundage (Harvard University Press); “American Eden: David
Hosack, Botany, and Medicine in the Garden of the Early Republic,” by
Victoria Johnson (Liveright/W.W.
Norton).

BIOGRAPHY

## The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke by Jeffrey C. Stewart (Oxford University Press)

Mr. Stewart, a professor of black studies at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, was honored for offering “a panoramic view of
the personal trials and artistic triumphs of the father of the Harlem
Renaissance and the movement he inspired.” Locke, whose protégés
included Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, believed artistic
expression was crucial to racial progress. “We don’t often celebrate
people who create room and space for others,” Mr. Stewart, 69, said.
“That’s one thing I really love about Locke.”

POETRY

## Be With by Forrest Gander (New Directions)

The poems in [Forrest Gander](https://forrestgander.com/)’s latest
collection deal with, among other things, grief. His wife, the acclaimed
poet C. D. Wright, died suddenly in 2016 at 67. “I didn’t write for
almost two years,” Gander, 63, said of the period after her death. “We
were always great readers of each other’s work.” When he started writing
again, the poems “just came out,” requiring less revising than usual. He
was glad readers felt, as he did, that “writing about the darkness might
be transformative.”

**Finalists** “feeld,” by jos charles (Milkweed); “Like,” by A. E.
Stallings (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux).

GENERAL
NONFICTION

## Amity and Prosperity: One Family and the Fracturing of America by Eliza Griswold (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)

[Ms. Griswold](https://www.elizagriswoldauthor.com/), 46, observed one
family in Amity, Penn., over seven years for this book about how
hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, affected the town. “What
Griswold depicts is a community, like the earth, cracked open,” [our
reviewer
wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/13/books/review-amity-prosperity-fracking-eliza-griswold.html).
“Every book takes a village, that’s the nature of books, but this one
took two,” said Ms. Griswold, adding that she felt “deeply grateful” to
the people of Amity.

MUSIC

## “prism” by Ellen Reid, premiered by the Los Angeles Opera on Nov. 29, 2018

In this haunting opera, a mother and daughter grapple with trauma and
guilt after a sexual assault. The[Pulitzer board
praised](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/ellen-reid) the way Ms. Reid,
36, uses “sophisticated vocal writing and striking instrumental timbres
to confront difficult subject matter: the effects of sexual and
emotional abuse.” Ms. Reid said in an interview that she had worked on
the piece for five years. “There were times when I didn’t want to finish
the piece,” she said. Roxie Perkins wrote the elliptical, poetic
libretto.

**Finalists** “Sustain,” by Andrew Norman, premiered by the Los Angeles
Philharmonic (Schott Music), and “Still,” by James Romig, released by
New World Records.

SPECIAL CITATION

## The Capital Gazette, Annapolis, Md.

Employees of the Capital Gazette were recognized for [reporting and
publishing
news](https://www.capitalgazette.com/news/annapolis/bs-md-gazette-shooting-20180628-story.html)
even as they dealt with a shooting in their newsroom that left five
colleagues dead. After the attack, the deadliest against journalists in
United States history, some journalists gathered in a garage across the
street to file articles and photographs. “We are [putting out a damn
paper](https://twitter.com/chaseacook/status/1012465236195061766),” one
said on Twitter that day. The Pulitzer board awarded the paper a
$100,000 grant to support its
work.

Special citation

## Aretha Franklin

When the “Queen of Soul" [died last year
at 76](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/16/obituaries/aretha-franklin-dead.html),
she had won 18 Grammy Awards and placed more than 100 singles on the
Billboard charts (“Respect” and “Think” among them). The Pulitzer board
recognized Franklin, who bridged gospel traditions with secular music,
“for her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more
than five decades.” In receiving the posthumous honor, she joins such
other popular music titans as Hank Williams (2010) and Duke Ellington
(1999).
