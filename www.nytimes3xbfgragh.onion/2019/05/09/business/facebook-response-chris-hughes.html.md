Facebook pushed back Thursday after Chris Hughes, a billionaire
co-founder of the company, argued in a New York Times Op-Ed essay that
the company should be broken up and regulated.

“Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability,” Nick Clegg,
Facebook’s vice president for global affairs and communication, wrote in
a statement. “But you don’t enforce accountability by calling for the
breakup of a successful American company.”

The statement followed a [lengthy Op-Ed by Mr.
Hughes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html)
published online Thursday morning arguing that the social media giant be
subjected to extensive government oversight and separated into multiple
companies, notably by spinning off the photo-sharing app Instagram and
the messenger service WhatsApp. The essay will appear in print on
Sunday.

Mr. Hughes was a co-founder of Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg 15 years
ago when they were undergraduates at Harvard. He [left the company
in 2007](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/the-daily-need/the-facebook-co-founder-who-got-away/3847/)
to work with the Obama campaign and more recently has focused on the
issue of income inequality. In the essay, he said repeatedly that Mr.
Zuckerberg is a good, kind person but simply has too much power for any
one individual.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The government must hold Mark accountable,” Mr. Hughes wrote in the
5,800-word column, arguing that the social media giant has grown far too
powerful.

“From our earliest days, Mark used the word ‘domination’ to describe our
ambitions, with no hint of irony or humility,” he wrote. “Over a decade
later, Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a
trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of
the world’s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly,
eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social
networking category.”

*\[Read Chris Hughes’s* [*argument for breaking up
Facebook*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article)*.\]*

Though others have made similar arguments over the past year, the essay
by a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg drew intense interest, given
Mr. Hughes’s role in the start of the company and his once close-knit
relationship with Mr. Zuckerberg.

Naturally, the debate also played out on Facebook itself and other
social media platforms. Some said Mr. Hughes’s argument rang hollow
because he had made hundreds of millions of dollars from Facebook.
Others said that a breakup would not fix the core issues posed by a few
companies with so much power over the flow of information.

The specific prescription Mr. Hughes offered was government
intervention. He wrote that the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice
Department “should enforce antitrust laws by undoing the Instagram and
WhatsApp acquisitions and banning future acquisitions for several
years.” He called the decision to allow Facebook to buy these two
major competitors “the F.T.C.’s biggest mistake.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He also argued that simply breaking up Facebook would not be sufficient.
“We need a new agency, empowered by Congress to regulate tech
companies,” he wrote, saying that “its first mandate should be to
protect privacy.”

One person who embraced the essay was Senator Elizabeth Warren, the
Massachusetts Democrat who has made the breakup of Facebook, Google and
Amazon a cornerstone of her presidential campaign. She
[expressed](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1126493176406081537) her
support on Twitter and [on
Medium](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Weak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in
competition and innovation in the tech sector,” Ms. Warren wrote.
“Venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new start-ups to compete
with these big tech companies because it’s so easy for the big companies
to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business.”

[Tim Wu,](https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/timothy-wu) a professor
of antitrust law at Columbia Law School and the author of “[The Curse of
Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded
Age](https://www.amazon.com/Curse-Bigness-Antitrust-New-Gilded/dp/0999745468),”
also applauded the proposal. “It would be part of an American tradition
of breaking up some of the largest tech companies that has produced
positive results,” he said.

He pointed to the [case of
AT\&T](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1995/09/22/business/at-t-move-is-a-reversal-of-course-set-in-1980-s.html),
the telephone monopoly that was disassembled into eight smaller
companies in 1984. “A lot of what we now call the internet revolution
was a byproduct of the breakup,” he said.

But Kent Lassman, the president of the[Competitive Enterprise
Institute](http://cei.org/), said industry-specific regulations can
backfire. Established business interests will use them to ward off
competition, he said. “It is absurd for innovative companies to require
constant permission from regulators like the F.T.C. to adapt to a
dynamic market.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a practical matter, a Facebook breakup won’t happen anytime soon,
said [Bill Kovacic](https://www.law.gwu.edu/william-e-kovacic), a
professor of global competition at George Washington Law School. He said
Facebook could argue that it had grown WhatsApp and Instagram into
successful businesses with satisfied customers: “How do we know they
would have turned out to be an independent and effective competitor?”

He said that Mr. Hughes’s essay “dramatically underestimates the
difficulty for the government to prevail in such a case.”
