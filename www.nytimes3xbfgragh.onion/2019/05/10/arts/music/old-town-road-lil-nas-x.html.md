## ‘Old Town Road’: See How Memes and Controversy Took Lil Nas X to No. 1

#### TikTok dances. Nine Inch Nails. Billy Ray Cyrus. How an unknown Atlanta artist and a Dutch bedroom producer joined forces online to make a record-breaking, chart-topping smash.

  -   
    “Hey. What’s going on?” “Everything’s going on.” “Everything is
    going on. Mr. Cyrus, how are you?” “I’m doing good, Joe. How you
    doing?” “Yo, what’s up?” “I like your robe.” “Thanks. Yeah, I always
    make beats in this.” “Play the number one song in the world.” “O.K.
    Let’s hear ‘Old Town Road’ by Lil Nas X. (SINGING) I got the horses
    in the back. Horse tack is attached. Hat is matte black. Got the
    boots that’s black to match.” “No\! No\!” “So you were just, like,
    throwing stuff up on SoundCloud that you recorded in your bedroom?”
    “Either in the closet of my bedroom, or the closet in my grandma’s
    house. Like, making studios out of those.” “Well, I’m from the
    Netherlands. I live in a small town next to Amsterdam. This is where
    I make my beats. It’s just, like, a desk with two monitors, and I’m
    just selling my beats online. I can make quality beats really fast.
    So I can, like, put out, like, 10 a day, you know?” “The banjos, you
    know? It really just hits me. That’s why I made the track.” “Who
    wrote the sample?” “It was Nine Inch Nails.” “But I had never heard
    of Nine Inch Nails before. But they have — they make some really
    good music, you know?” “I always get my beats, like, from YouTube. I
    would just go through, like, 100 beats.” “It’s really just luck that
    people just find your stuff, you know? It’s really luck.” “I found
    the beat on, like, Halloween night. The beat was just speaking to
    me, you know? I was, like, this song’s gonna be great.” “Did you
    conceive of the song as a country rap song?” “Country trap. But,
    like, if I had to choose which one it’s more leaning towards, it
    would definitely be country. I got the horses in the back. Horse
    tack is attached. Hat is matte black. Got the boots that’s black to
    match. I knew ‘Old Town Road’ had to have some kind of funny lyrics,
    just to keep people entertained. Cowboy hat from Gucci. Wrangler on
    my booty.” “Did you have a job at the time? Were you working?” “No,
    I was not working. Like, I was pushing my music through the
    internet, like, full time. From the very night I released ‘Old Town
    Road’ on Twitter, this song was already, like, moving. (SINGING) I’m
    gonna take my horse to the old town road. I’m gonna ride till I
    can’t no more. I got the horses in the back —” “I randomly found
    it on Twitter. Somebody put his song over a video that I already
    did. And then I was like, hold on. This song is — this song is kind
    of hard.” “(SINGING) I got the horses in the back.” “It put the
    black yeehaw agenda and the song together, and it just — shot off.”
    “A lot of people like to say, you know, it was, like, a kid
    accidentally got it. It’s like, no, this is no accident. Like, I’ve
    been — I’ve been pushing this hard. The internet is basically, like,
    my parents, in a way. I was raised picking up on stuff. I had to
    learn how to use it, you know, in my own way.” “I saw you made that
    post on Reddit where you were, like, what’s that song that goes, I’m
    gonna take my horse to the old town road?” “Yeah, I did that.
    Because I knew that’s what people were gonna search. Oh, my God.
    That’s embarrassing.” “I didn’t really know the song existed. I
    think it was a girl who sent me a meme, and she was like, hey, I
    heard you’re producer tag.” “Kio. Kio.” “So you’d never met Nas X
    before?” “Never. No.” “You didn’t know who he was?” “I didn’t know
    who he was. Nothing. I feel like it was meant to be, you know? Me
    finding him right on time.” “(SINGING) I got the horses in the back.
    Horse tack is attached.” “It’s 15 second videos. I have a hard time
    explaining it to anyone that’s like, so you make money how? I’m
    like, I dance on camera.” “Are you the first person to post ‘Old
    Town Road’ on Tik Tok?” “Yeah. It went \[bleep\] crazy.” “(SINGING)
    I got the horses in the back.” “Everyone was dressed like a cowboy
    for, like, three weeks.” “(SINGING) Got the boots that’s black to
    match. Ridin’ on a horse —” “Once it hit Tik Tok, and it was going
    viral, I was like, O.K. We won.” “We passed the biggest songs out,
    and we just passed it, like it’s nothing.” “(SINGING) You can’t tell
    me nothing. Can’t nobody tell me nothing.” “You hear that? That’s
    ‘Old Town Road,’ Lil Nas X’s big hit, and it was tearing up the
    country charts until Billboard pulled it off for not being country
    enough.” “Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, now. You got too much dip on your
    chip.” “Do you think there’s a racial element to ‘Old Town Road’
    being removed from the country chart?” “I see it as more of, like, a
    — we let certain things slide, but maybe this one is too different.
    If we allow this, who knows?” “I was really mad, because if it
    didn’t go off the charts, it would be, like, number one.” “Billy
    Ray, tell me when you first heard ‘Old Town Road.’” “I heard the
    song on March the 16th.” “Who played it for you?” “Tish.” “That’s
    your wife?” “Yep. And we were having our morning coffee, and she got
    a call, I think, from Ron Perry at the record label. And he said,
    hey, we’ve got this thing, we’d love for your husband to hear it.
    And I actually stood up out of my chair. I stood up and go, God, I
    love that. That dude is original.” “If you go to my past tweets,
    like, two days after I put out the song, I’m like, Twitter, please
    help me get Billy Ray on there. Because I was, like, Billy Ray Cyrus
    would be perfect for this.” “(SINGING) Hat down, crosstown, living
    like a rockstar. Spend a lot of money on my —” “Billy Ray, where’s
    ‘Old Town Road’ on the charts right now?” “Which charts?” “The
    main chart. The Billboard Hot 100.” “Oh, ‘Old Town Road’ is number
    one.” “Yeah, I’m gonna take my horse to the old town road. I’m gonna
    ride till I can’t no more.” “It’s my beats, you know? I just made it
    here, in my bedroom, and now the whole entire planet is listening to
    it.” “Ridin’ on a horse.” “I can’t go down the street without
    hearing that song at all. From the internet, which is amazing.”
    “(SINGING) Can’t nobody tell me nothing.” “Every now and then, a
    song like that comes around, and I count my blessings that they
    reached out to me, and just let me be a part of this moment.” “Are
    you ready to play it a million times for the rest of your life?”
    “Yes. I’m gonna play this song — this is my life song at this
    point.” “(SINGING) I’m gonna ride till I can’t no more. Yeah, I’m
    gonna take my horse —” “Do you have plans to come to the U.S.?”
    “Yeah. Yeah, of course. But I’m, like, gonna let you know, so I
    can’t just drop everything, and just go there.” “(SINGING) I’m gonna
    ride —” “Have you ever ridden a horse?” “Not yet.” “That’s the
    craziest part.” “Maybe in the music video?” “Oh, of course. Come on,
    now.” \[horse

Lil Nas X was an unknown, unemployed 19-year-old college dropout when he
bought a slightly twangy rap beat from a Dutch stranger on the internet.

“Old Town Road,” the one-minute and 53-second song that he uploaded to
SoundCloud and YouTube not long after, has since become an almost
unprecedented cultural phenomenon, bringing together a cross-section of
unlikely characters including Nine Inch Nails (whose instrumental track
was sampled for the beat), Billy Ray Cyrus (who recorded a chart-topping
remix) and the Texas Tech college basketball team (who wouldn’t stop
[dancing to
it](https://www.cbssports.com/g00/college-basketball/news/ncaa-tournament-championship-2019-how-old-town-road-became-texas-techs-unlikely-theme-song/)).

Along its path to ubiquity, “Old Town Road” also earned Lil Nas X a
major deal with Columbia Records and [sparked a
controversy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/05/business/media/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-billboard.html)
over race and the sanctity of country music when the song was removed
from the genre’s Billboard chart. Nashville bona fides aside — Lil Nas X
calls the track a hybrid: “country-trap” — in July, it became the
[longest-running No. 1
single](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/29/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-billboard-record.html)
in the 61-year history of Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.

Though the song came out of nowhere, it wasn’t quite a fluke. Lil Nas X,
now 20, had been a student of online virality and a prolific amateur
meme-maker, skills he put to use while marketing the song himself in its
early stages. With a combination of imagery from the popular video game
[“Red Dead Redemption 2”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ho88VXJTBg)
and the wave of buzz around the black cowboy aesthetic known as [the
“yeehaw
agenda,”](https://jezebel.com/what-everyone-is-getting-wrong-about-the-yee-haw-agenda-1833558033)
“Old Town Road” became the soundtrack to a dance challenge on the social
network TikTok and countless Instagram clips, priming it for a
mainstream breakthrough.

In the latest “Diary of a Song” episode, Lil Nas X is joined by the
producer YoungKio — who didn’t even know he was a part of “Old Town
Road” until he heard it in a video meme — and Billy Ray Cyrus, who
lent the song another layer of novelty and outlaw credibility. The video
also features cameos by the influencers
[@nicemichael](https://www.tiktok.com/share/user/6589585369837469702)
and [@elitelife\_kd](https://www.instagram.com/elitelife_kd/?hl=en), who
were crucial to the track’s early rise.
