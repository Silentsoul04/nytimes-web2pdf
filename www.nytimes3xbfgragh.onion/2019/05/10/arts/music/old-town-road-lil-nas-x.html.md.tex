  ``Hey. What's going on?'' ``Everything's going on.'' ``Everything is
  going on. Mr. Cyrus, how are you?'' ``I'm doing good, Joe. How you
  doing?'' ``Yo, what's up?'' ``I like your robe.'' ``Thanks. Yeah, I
  always make beats in this.'' ``Play the number one song in the
  world.'' ``O.K. Let's hear `Old Town Road' by Lil Nas X. (SINGING) I
  got the horses in the back. Horse tack is attached. Hat is matte
  black. Got the boots that's black to match.'' ``No! No!'' ``So you
  were just, like, throwing stuff up on SoundCloud that you recorded in
  your bedroom?'' ``Either in the closet of my bedroom, or the closet in
  my grandma's house. Like, making studios out of those.'' ``Well, I'm
  from the Netherlands. I live in a small town next to Amsterdam. This
  is where I make my beats. It's just, like, a desk with two monitors,
  and I'm just selling my beats online. I can make quality beats really
  fast. So I can, like, put out, like, 10 a day, you know?'' ``The
  banjos, you know? It really just hits me. That's why I made the
  track.'' ``Who wrote the sample?'' ``It was Nine Inch Nails.'' ``But I
  had never heard of Nine Inch Nails before. But they have --- they make
  some really good music, you know?'' ``I always get my beats, like,
  from YouTube. I would just go through, like, 100 beats.'' ``It's
  really just luck that people just find your stuff, you know? It's
  really luck.'' ``I found the beat on, like, Halloween night. The beat
  was just speaking to me, you know? I was, like, this song's gonna be
  great.'' ``Did you conceive of the song as a country rap song?''
  ``Country trap. But, like, if I had to choose which one it's more
  leaning towards, it would definitely be country. I got the horses in
  the back. Horse tack is attached. Hat is matte black. Got the boots
  that's black to match. I knew `Old Town Road' had to have some kind of
  funny lyrics, just to keep people entertained. Cowboy hat from Gucci.
  Wrangler on my booty.'' ``Did you have a job at the time? Were you
  working?'' ``No, I was not working. Like, I was pushing my music
  through the internet, like, full time. From the very night I released
  `Old Town Road' on Twitter, this song was already, like, moving.
  (SINGING) I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road. I'm gonna ride
  till I can't no more. I got the horses in the back ---'' ``I randomly
  found it on Twitter. Somebody put his song over a video that I already
  did. And then I was like, hold on. This song is --- this song is kind
  of hard.'' ``(SINGING) I got the horses in the back.'' ``It put the
  black yeehaw agenda and the song together, and it just --- shot off.''
  ``A lot of people like to say, you know, it was, like, a kid
  accidentally got it. It's like, no, this is no accident. Like, I've
  been --- I've been pushing this hard. The internet is basically, like,
  my parents, in a way. I was raised picking up on stuff. I had to learn
  how to use it, you know, in my own way.'' ``I saw you made that post
  on Reddit where you were, like, what's that song that goes, I'm gonna
  take my horse to the old town road?'' ``Yeah, I did that. Because I
  knew that's what people were gonna search. Oh, my God. That's
  embarrassing.'' ``I didn't really know the song existed. I think it
  was a girl who sent me a meme, and she was like, hey, I heard you're
  producer tag.'' ``Kio. Kio.'' ``So you'd never met Nas X before?''
  ``Never. No.'' ``You didn't know who he was?'' ``I didn't know who he
  was. Nothing. I feel like it was meant to be, you know? Me finding him
  right on time.'' ``(SINGING) I got the horses in the back. Horse tack
  is attached.'' ``It's 15 second videos. I have a hard time explaining
  it to anyone that's like, so you make money how? I'm like, I dance on
  camera.'' ``Are you the first person to post `Old Town Road' on Tik
  Tok?'' ``Yeah. It went {[}bleep{]} crazy.'' ``(SINGING) I got the
  horses in the back.'' ``Everyone was dressed like a cowboy for, like,
  three weeks.'' ``(SINGING) Got the boots that's black to match. Ridin'
  on a horse ---'' ``Once it hit Tik Tok, and it was going viral, I was
  like, O.K. We won.'' ``We passed the biggest songs out, and we just
  passed it, like it's nothing.'' ``(SINGING) You can't tell me nothing.
  Can't nobody tell me nothing.'' ``You hear that? That's `Old Town
  Road,' Lil Nas X's big hit, and it was tearing up the country charts
  until Billboard pulled it off for not being country enough.'' ``Oh,
  whoa, whoa, whoa, now. You got too much dip on your chip.'' ``Do you
  think there's a racial element to `Old Town Road' being removed from
  the country chart?'' ``I see it as more of, like, a --- we let certain
  things slide, but maybe this one is too different. If we allow this,
  who knows?'' ``I was really mad, because if it didn't go off the
  charts, it would be, like, number one.'' ``Billy Ray, tell me when you
  first heard `Old Town Road.''' ``I heard the song on March the 16th.''
  ``Who played it for you?'' ``Tish.'' ``That's your wife?'' ``Yep. And
  we were having our morning coffee, and she got a call, I think, from
  Ron Perry at the record label. And he said, hey, we've got this thing,
  we'd love for your husband to hear it. And I actually stood up out of
  my chair. I stood up and go, God, I love that. That dude is
  original.'' ``If you go to my past tweets, like, two days after I put
  out the song, I'm like, Twitter, please help me get Billy Ray on
  there. Because I was, like, Billy Ray Cyrus would be perfect for
  this.'' ``(SINGING) Hat down, crosstown, living like a rockstar. Spend
  a lot of money on my ---'' ``Billy Ray, where's `Old Town Road' on the
  charts right now?'' ``Which charts?'' ``The main chart. The Billboard
  Hot 100.'' ``Oh, `Old Town Road' is number one.'' ``Yeah, I'm gonna
  take my horse to the old town road. I'm gonna ride till I can't no
  more.'' ``It's my beats, you know? I just made it here, in my bedroom,
  and now the whole entire planet is listening to it.'' ``Ridin' on a
  horse.'' ``I can't go down the street without hearing that song at
  all. From the internet, which is amazing.'' ``(SINGING) Can't nobody
  tell me nothing.'' ``Every now and then, a song like that comes
  around, and I count my blessings that they reached out to me, and just
  let me be a part of this moment.'' ``Are you ready to play it a
  million times for the rest of your life?'' ``Yes. I'm gonna play this
  song --- this is my life song at this point.'' ``(SINGING) I'm gonna
  ride till I can't no more. Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse ---'' ``Do
  you have plans to come to the U.S.?'' ``Yeah. Yeah, of course. But
  I'm, like, gonna let you know, so I can't just drop everything, and
  just go there.'' ``(SINGING) I'm gonna ride ---'' ``Have you ever
  ridden a horse?'' ``Not yet.'' ``That's the craziest part.'' ``Maybe
  in the music video?'' ``Oh, of course. Come on, now.'' {[}horse

Lil Nas X was an unknown, unemployed 19-year-old college dropout when he
bought a slightly twangy rap beat from a Dutch stranger on the internet.

``Old Town Road,'' the one-minute and 53-second song that he uploaded to
SoundCloud and YouTube not long after, has since become an almost
unprecedented cultural phenomenon, bringing together a cross-section of
unlikely characters including Nine Inch Nails (whose instrumental track
was sampled for the beat), Billy Ray Cyrus (who recorded a chart-topping
remix) and the Texas Tech college basketball team (who wouldn't stop
\href{https://www.cbssports.com/g00/college-basketball/news/ncaa-tournament-championship-2019-how-old-town-road-became-texas-techs-unlikely-theme-song/}{dancing
to it}).

Along its path to ubiquity, ``Old Town Road'' also earned Lil Nas X a
major deal with Columbia Records and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/05/business/media/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-billboard.html}{sparked
a controversy} over race and the sanctity of country music when the song
was removed from the genre's Billboard chart. Nashville bona fides aside
--- Lil Nas X calls the track a hybrid: ``country-trap'' --- in July, it
became the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/29/arts/music/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-billboard-record.html}{longest-running
No. 1 single} in the 61-year history of Billboard's Hot 100 chart.

Though the song came out of nowhere, it wasn't quite a fluke. Lil Nas X,
now 20, had been a student of online virality and a prolific amateur
meme-maker, skills he put to use while marketing the song himself in its
early stages. With a combination of imagery from the popular video game
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ho88VXJTBg}{``Red Dead Redemption
2''} and the wave of buzz around the black cowboy aesthetic known as
\href{https://jezebel.com/what-everyone-is-getting-wrong-about-the-yee-haw-agenda-1833558033}{the
``yeehaw agenda,''} ``Old Town Road'' became the soundtrack to a dance
challenge on the social network TikTok and countless Instagram clips,
priming it for a mainstream breakthrough.

In the latest ``Diary of a Song'' episode, Lil Nas X is joined by the
producer YoungKio --- who didn't even know he was a part of ``Old Town
Road'' until he heard it in a video meme --- and Billy Ray Cyrus, who
lent the song another layer of novelty and outlaw credibility. The video
also features cameos by the influencers
\href{https://www.tiktok.com/share/user/6589585369837469702}{@nicemichael}
and
\href{https://www.instagram.com/elitelife_kd/?hl=en}{@elitelife\_kd},
who were crucial to the track's early rise.

\emph{``Diary of a Song'' provides an up-close, behind-the-scenes look
at how pop music is made today, using archival material --- voice memos,
demo versions, text messages, emails, interviews and more --- to tell
the story behind the track.}
