I've been one of Nike's most widely marketed athletes. If I can't secure
maternity protections, who can?

I've always known that expressing myself could hurt my career. I've
tried not to show emotion, to anticipate what people expect from me and
to do it. I don't like to let people down. But you can't change anything
with silence.

Last week, two of my former Nike teammates, the Olympian runners Alysia
Montaño and Kara Goucher, heroically broke their nondisclosure
agreements with the company to share their pregnancy stories in a New
York Times investigation.

They told stories we athletes know are true, but have been too scared to
tell publicly: If we have children, we risk pay cuts from our sponsors
during pregnancy and afterward. It's one example of a sports industry
where the rules are still mostly made for and by men.

I have my own pregnancy story as a professional runner.

For most of my life, I was focused on one thing: winning medals. And I
was good at it. At 32, I was one of the most decorated athletes in
history: a six-time Olympic gold medal winner and an 11-time world
champion. But last year, my focus expanded: I wanted to be a
professional athlete \emph{and} a mother. In some ways, that dream was
crazy.

I decided to start a family in 2018 knowing that pregnancy can be ``the
kiss of death'' in my industry, as the runner Phoebe Wright
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/12/opinion/nike-maternity-leave.html}{put
it in The Times} last week. It was a terrifying time for me because I
was negotiating a renewal of my Nike contract, which had ended in
December 2017.

I felt pressure to return to form as soon as possible after the birth of
my daughter in November 2018, even though I ultimately had to undergo an
emergency C-section at 32 weeks because of severe pre-eclampsia that
threatened the lives of me and my baby.

Meanwhile, negotiations were not going well. Despite all my victories,
Nike wanted to pay me 70 percent less than before. If that's what they
think I'm worth now, I accept that.

What I'm not willing to accept is the enduring status quo around
maternity. I asked Nike to contractually guarantee that I wouldn't be
punished if I didn't perform at my best in the months surrounding
childbirth. I wanted to set a new standard. If I, one of Nike's most
widely marketed athletes, couldn't secure these protections, who could?

Nike declined. We've been at a standstill ever since.

Ironically, one of the deciding factors for me in signing with Nike
nearly a decade ago was what I thought were Nike's core principles. I
could have signed elsewhere for more money.

But when I met with the company's leadership in 2010, one woman told me
about a Nike-sponsored initiative called the Girl Effect that promoted
adolescent girls as the key to improving societies around the globe. By
joining Nike, she said, I could help empower women. She told me Nike
believed in women and girls, and I believed her.

Which is part of why my recent experience has been so heartbreaking.

My disappointment is not just with Nike, but with how the sports apparel
industry at large treats female athletes. This isn't just about
pregnancy. We may stand behind the brands we endorse, but we also need
to hold them accountable when they are marketing us to appeal to the
next generation of athletes and consumers.

Last week, thanks to the voices of a few brave women, the industry took
a step in the right direction. Brands like Burton, Altra, Nuun and
Brooks came forward to announce new contractual guarantees for women who
have children while being supported by their sponsorships. A few days
later, Nike also committed to changing its maternity policy, announcing,
according to The Wall Street Journal, that ``it is adding language to
new contracts for female athletes that will protect their pay during
pregnancy.'' I applaud Nike for seeing that change was necessary, and I
look forward to specifics, from Nike and the rest of the industry who
has yet to commit to contractually protecting women.

Athletes are told to shut up and play. We are told that no one cares
about our politics. We are told that we're just entertainers, so run
fast, jump high, and throw far. And don't mess up.

But pregnancy is not messing up; for women it can and should be able to
be part of a thriving professional athletic career, as my teammates have
shown and I hope to show too. And I dream of a day when we don't have to
fight in order to try.

Protection during maternity isn't just limited to Olympians; working
women all over the U.S. deserve protection when they have children. We
shouldn't have to rely on companies to do the right thing. Our families
depend on it.
