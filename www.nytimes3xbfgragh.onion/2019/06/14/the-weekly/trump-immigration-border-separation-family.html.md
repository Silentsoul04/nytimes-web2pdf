## The Youngest Known Child Separated From His Family at the U.S. Border Under Trump

#### He was just 4 months old when he was sent to live with a foster family as his father was detained and ultimately deported.

</div>

  -   
    \<i\>\[tense music\]\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>WOMAN: Hey Buddy. Are
    you happy, happy?\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: This is Constantin Mutu.\</i\>
    \<i\>Five months of his life were documented\</i\> \<i\>through
    these images.\</i\> \<i\>At just four months old he was taken from
    his father\</i\> \<i\>at the United States Border, making him the
    youngest child\</i\> \<i\>to be separated by the Trump
    Administration.\</i\> \<i\>But there were thousands of
    children\</i\> \<i\>separated like him.\</i\> All right, thanks for
    calling back. \<i\>My name is Caitlin Dickerson.\</i\> \<i\>I’m a
    national immigration reporter\</i\> \<i\>for The New York Times.
    \</i\>And you need that to give credence to the report, right?
    \<i\>Constantin’s separation took place\</i\> \<i\>at the same time
    I was reporting\</i\> \<i\>on family separations at the US
    border.\</i\> \<i\>I’m going to tell you how my reporting helped to
    uncover\</i\> \<i\>one of the Trump Administration’s\</i\> \<i\>most
    contentious policies. \[baby cooing\]\</i\> \<i\>And how that policy
    altered one infant’s life.\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>Even before
    Constantin was born,\</i\> \<i\>the plans that would come to upend
    his life\</i\> \<i\>were already in motion.\</i\> \<i\>WOMAN: The
    fears are growing in the face\</i\> \<i\>of President Trump’s plans
    to step up\</i\> \<i\>immigration law enforcement.\</i\>
    \<i\>CAITLIN: A new administration\</i\> \<i\>had set its sights on
    the southern US border\</i\> \<i\>calling the situation a threat to
    national security.\</i\> \<i\>JEFF SESSIONS: They are violating the
    law\</i\> \<i\>and they need to be prosecuted.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN:
    The number of people seeking asylum was increasing.\</i\> \<i\>That
    included families\</i\> \<i\>who would not ultimately qualify to
    stay.\</i\> \<i\>MAN: Are department of Homeland Security
    personnel\</i\> \<i\>gonna separate the children from their moms and
    dads?\</i\> \<i\>JEFF: We—we have tremendous...\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN:
    So Trump officials were working on\</i\> \<i\>an aggressive plan to
    stop people\</i\> \<i\>from crossing the border.\</i\> \<i\>- Yes, I
    am considering in order to deter,\</i\> \<i\>uh, more movement along
    this terribly dangerous network...\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: One idea was
    to separate children\</i\> \<i\>from their families. - Exactly
    that.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: After a backlash, the administration\</i\>
    \<i\>publicly retreated from the idea.\</i\> \<i\>But soon after I
    got a tip\</i\> \<i\>that it was still moving forward behind closed
    doors.\</i\> \<i\>Sources said the White House favored the
    policy\</i\> \<i\>and plans were being drafted to separate
    families,\</i\> \<i\>and to justify the separations legally.\</i\>
    \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>That was when we published\</i\> \<i\>our first
    story on separations.\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>Meanwhile, thousands
    of miles\</i\> \<i\>from Washington Constantin’s family was
    making\</i\> \<i\>their own plans to come to the United
    States.\</i\> 276 is what we’re looking for. Vasile? - Yes. - I’m
    Caitlin. Hi. - Hi. \<i\>CAITLIN: I’d first come across\</i\>
    \<i\>the mention of a four-month-old baby\</i\> \<i\>in court
    documents.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: I was struck by his age\</i\>
    \<i\>and quickly confirmed he was\</i\> \<i\>the youngest separated
    child.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: So I started searching\</i\> \<i\>for him
    and his family.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: Constantin was from
    Romania.\</i\> \<i\>The vast majority of people affected by this
    policy\</i\> \<i\>were from Central America...\</i\> \<i\>but
    Constantin’s experience reflects the stories\</i\> \<i\>of thousands
    of families, from El Salvador,\</i\> \<i\>to Mexico, to
    Romania.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: The Mutus live at the far end of a
    village\</i\> \<i\>in a shared family home.\</i\> \<i\>Constantin’s
    parents, Vasile and Florentina,\</i\> \<i\>got married when they
    were teenagers.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: The Mutus are Roma,\</i\>
    \<i\>which means they’re part of a community\</i\> \<i\>that has
    long faced discrimination\</i\> \<i\>in many parts of the
    world.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: They said their children were
    harassed\</i\> \<i\>in school and that they struggled to find
    jobs\</i\> \<i\>and receive treatment when they went to the
    hospital.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: Vasile and Florentina told me that,
    like many Roma,\</i\> \<i\>their families had taken odd jobs\</i\>
    \<i\>and often begged for money across Europe\</i\> \<i\>to support
    themselves.\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>The Mutus knew other people in
    their community\</i\> \<i\>who had claimed asylum in the United
    States,\</i\> \<i\>so they made plans to do the same.\</i\>
    \<i\>CAITLIN: They decided to travel with Constantin\</i\> \<i\>and
    his four-year-old brother.\</i\> \<i\>Their older children would
    join them later.\</i\> \<i\>The flew to Mexico on February 8th,
    2018,\</i\> \<i\>and boarded a bus to the US border.\</i\>
    \<i\>Right before they arrived, the bus accidentally left\</i\>
    \<i\>Florentina and their older son behind at a rest stop.\</i\>
    \<i\>Vasile was alone with Constantin.\</i\> \<i\>He couldn’t reach
    Florentina\</i\> \<i\>so he decided to cross the bridge\</i\>
    \<i\>into Brownsville, Texas, a legal port of entry,\</i\> \<i\>and
    wait for his wife.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: For several hours, he waited
    with Constantin\</i\> \<i\>with no understanding\</i\> \<i\>of the
    political context he’d just walked into.\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\>
    \<i\>CAITLIN: Vasile says that border patrol agents\</i\>
    \<i\>didn’t explain why they were taking Constantin,\</i\> \<i\>or
    where he was going.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: After Vasile and his son
    were separated,\</i\> \<i\>Constantin was placed in the care of the
    US Government.\</i\> \<i\>At four months old, he was served this
    notice\</i\> \<i\>to appear before an immigration judge.\</i\>
    \<i\>Three days later,\</i\> \<i\>government workers flew him
    here\</i\> \<i\>to western Michigan.\</i\> \<i\>\[tense
    music\]\</i\> Do you remember the first time you heard about
    Constantin? - Yes, there was just a lot of surprise and skepticism.
    Everyone trying to figure out, like, how— who is bringing this
    infant, how are we going to get him here, we’ve never had a kid this
    young, and so that was... \<i\>CAITLIN: Ana Devereaux and Camila
    Trefftz\</i\> \<i\>work with a legal aid organization\</i\>
    \<i\>that typically represents kids who cross the border\</i\>
    \<i\>without their parents.\</i\> What did you guys know about
    family separation... \<i\>But in the months before Constantin
    arrived,\</i\> \<i\>they began to see children who had crossed with
    a parent,\</i\> \<i\>but then were separated.\</i\> - Five to
    seven-year-olds that were coming, um, that would tell us, “I was
    separated from my parent.” We were seeing it more and more
    consistently without really understanding what the trends were or
    why it was happening. \<i\>CAITLIN: Like a lot of these kids,\</i\>
    \<i\>Constantin arrived in Michigan with no information\</i\>
    \<i\>about where his parents were or how to contact them.\</i\>
    \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>An entire team began to work on his case.\</i\>
    - I think the age gave all of us a sense of urgency of trying to
    figure out what was going on. \<i\>CAITLIN: Florentina decided that
    it wasn’t safe\</i\> \<i\>to cross the border, so she returned to
    Romania.\</i\> \<i\>Meanwhile, Vasile was detained in Texas.\</i\>
    \<i\>He had past convictions for fraud,\</i\> \<i\>one that involved
    robbery,\</i\> \<i\>but it’s not clear if that’s how officials\</i\>
    \<i\>justified separating him from Constantin.\</i\> \<i\>For nearly
    two weeks, Vasile and Florentina\</i\> \<i\>didn’t know where their
    baby was.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: Vasile was provided almost no
    translation services\</i\> \<i\>at the detention center.\</i\>
    \<i\>He withdrew his asylum application\</i\> \<i\>thinking that it
    would help him\</i\> \<i\>get Constantin back more quickly.\</i\>
    \<i\>Instead, he spent the next four months in detention.\</i\>
    \<i\>CAITLIN: The same month that Constantin\</i\> \<i\>arrived in
    Michigan,\</i\> \<i\>the American Civil Liberties Union\</i\>
    \<i\>told me that they were about to file a lawsuit\</i\> \<i\>on
    behalf of a mother who had been separated\</i\> \<i\>from her
    seven-year-old daughter.\</i\> \<i\>This woman became known as Ms.
    L.\</i\> \<i\>And her lawsuit eventually became a class action\</i\>
    \<i\>on behalf of all separated parents.\</i\> And what happened
    after you filed the lawsuit? - So, when we filed the national class
    action we had Ms. L but we also had affidavits from a number of
    other parents describing what happened to them in vivid detail and
    what we were hearing was that family separation was increasing.
    \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: Officials continued to deny\</i\>
    \<i\>that they were separating families.\</i\> \<i\>But then I
    learned of an internal government document.\</i\> \<i\>A list of
    separated children created to help\</i\> \<i\>find their parents
    within the federal system.\</i\> \<i\>A government spokesperson
    first denied\</i\> \<i\>the list was accurate,\</i\> \<i\>but
    several inside sources\</i\> \<i\>told me that it was.\</i\>
    \<i\>Ultimately, officials confirmed the document\</i\> \<i\>for the
    record...\</i\> \<i\>and we published our story.\</i\> \<i\>At that
    point, the list had more than 700 names.\</i\> \<i\>Lee: The first
    question from the judge was,\</i\> “Is the ‘New York Times’ report
    correct that there are now 700 families separated?” I think it
    really got the judge’s attention, because he then recognized the Ms.
    L situation was not a one off, it wasn’t a handful of cases, that we
    were looking at a potential humanitarian crisis here. - I have put
    in place zero-tolerance policy... \<i\>CAITLIN: It took another two
    weeks\</i\> \<i\>before then Attorney General Jeff Sessions\</i\>
    \<i\>made this announcement.\</i\> - If you cross the border
    unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child
    then we will prosecute you, and that child may be separated from you
    as required by law. \<i\>CAITLIN: The country would soon find
    out\</i\> \<i\>what this meant.\</i\> \<i\>\[tense music\]\</i\>
    \<i\>CAITLIN: As Trump’s zero-tolerance policy\</i\> \<i\>went into
    effect, hundreds more children\</i\> \<i\>were funneled into
    government custody.\</i\> \<i\>Some went into mass shelters\</i\>
    \<i\>while some of the youngest and most vulnerable\</i\> \<i\>were
    placed in foster homes.\</i\> \<i\>Constantin was placed in the care
    of a Michigan family\</i\> \<i\>who after months of
    negotiation\</i\> \<i\>agreed to speak with us.\</i\> \<i\>\[baby
    crying\]\</i\> WOMAN: Oh, yeah. He would do new sounds. They only do
    it for a short amount of time so you want his mom to be able to hear
    that. - And what do you remember of the first time that you met him?
    - He was all bundled up and it was nighttime so, the next morning
    our girls wanted to see him. So they crept into his room and were
    like, ”\[gasping\] Look at him\!” - And what did he... \<i\>For
    security reasons\</i\> \<i\>foster families are generally
    barred\</i\> \<i\>from talking to the media.\</i\> \<i\>We agreed
    not to reveal this family’s identity\</i\> \<i\>so they could speak
    about Constantin.\</i\> MAN: Different things go through you mind.
    You don’t know what his personality will be like. WOMAN: Even
    four-month-old babies, you have to get to know them. MAN: That looks
    like an earlier picture, too. WOMAN: He doesn’t have his curls yet.
    CAITLIN: His hair got curly at some point? WOMAN: Yeah, yeah. \<i\>I
    think for me, every time Constantin would...\</i\> \<i\>you know,
    like he started sitting up\</i\> \<i\>or he started to feed himself
    or, you know,\</i\> \<i\>when he started to really, like,
    interact.\</i\> \<i\>Um...\</i\> \<i\>I would always think, it
    breaks my heart\</i\> \<i\>that his mom is missing this
    moment.\</i\> \<i\>\[somber music\]\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>MAN:
    The hard part about taking care of him\</i\> \<i\>was knowing that
    he wasn’t being taken care of\</i\> \<i\>by the people that took
    such good care of him\</i\> \<i\>before he came to see us.\</i\>
    \<i\>WOMAN: You know, he has a loving family in...\</i\> \<i\>WOMAN:
    Baby\!\</i\> \<i\>WOMAN: Baby\!\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: Constantin was
    growing up\</i\> \<i\>with another family across the world.\</i\>
    WOMAN: Baby\! - \[giggling\] \<i\>CAITLIN: And as their bond
    grew...\</i\> \<i\>a chaotic political moment unfolded around all of
    them.\</i\> \<i\>Families arriving at the border\</i\> \<i\>now
    faced a new directive.\</i\> \<i\>The numbers of separated children
    were growing.\</i\> \<i\>Parents would end up thousands of miles
    apart\</i\> \<i\>from their children with no way of
    communicating.\</i\> \<i\>CAMILA: We were trying to find
    parents,\</i\> \<i\>trying to contact detention facilities,\</i\>
    meeting with kids and having them sob uncontrollably in our offices.
    \<i\>SCOTT: Parents are in ICE adult detention\</i\> \<i\>trying to
    find their children,\</i\> and there’s no process for putting them
    back together. Nobody at ICE has the phone number of the shelter
    that the kids have been sent to. \<i\>CAITLIN: Scott Shuchart worked
    in the\</i\> \<i\>Department of Homeland Security Civil Rights
    Office\</i\> \<i\>at the time. His team was processing\</i\>
    \<i\>hundreds of complaints a month,\</i\> \<i\>but even they were
    in the dark\</i\> \<i\>about how to track these families.\</i\> - We
    were trying to sound the alarm that was happening under
    zero-tolerance had major legal and constitutional problems. \[angry
    chanting\] \<i\>MAN: Across the country, outrage is building.\</i\>
    \<i\>CAITLIN: That summer, family separation\</i\> \<i\>grabbed the
    country’s attention.\</i\> \<i\>MAN: What kind of nation puts
    children in cages?\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: Then the news organization
    ProPublica\</i\> \<i\>released this audio from inside\</i\> \<i\>a
    federal detention center.\</i\> \<i\>\[children crying\]\</i\> -
    Well, good afternoon. It is my pleasure to be here. \<i\>CAITLIN:
    After months of contradicting statements\</i\> \<i\>from the
    administration,\</i\> \<i\>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen
    Nielsen\</i\> \<i\>gave an official explanation.\</i\> So in the
    last three months we have seen illegal immigration on our southern
    border exceed 50,000 people each month, \<i\>and a 435%
    increase\</i\> \<i\>in family units entering the country
    illegally.\</i\> \<i\>As long illegal entry remains a criminal
    offense,\</i\> \<i\>DHS will not look the other way.\</i\>
    \<i\>CAITLIN: Illegal entry is a crime,\</i\> \<i\>but it’s a low
    level offense that was rarely enforced\</i\> \<i\>against asylum
    seekers.\</i\> \<i\>Especially families.\</i\> \<i\>The Trump
    Administration changed that\</i\> \<i\>by ramping up prosecutions
    against more people,\</i\> \<i\>including those traveling with
    kids.\</i\> \<i\>Children can’t be held in jails,\</i\> \<i\>so they
    were separated from their parents.\</i\> \<i\>But even some families
    who crossed the border legally\</i\> \<i\>were separated, like
    Vasile and Constantin.\</i\> REPORTER: Are you intending for parents
    to be separated from their children? Are you intending to send a
    message? - I—I find that offensive. No, because why would I ever
    create a policy that purposely does that? - It’s not a policy change
    to enforce the law. That’s been—that’s been this administration’s
    policy since the day we got here. - I think it was just overwhelming
    to people that what we were working on was a policy where people had
    decided that hurting children was a way to achieve a general
    immigration policy goal. \<i\>\[tense music\]\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN:
    Then two things happened in less than a week.\</i\> - Well, thank
    you very much. We’re signing an executive order. \<i\>CAITLIN: In
    Washington, President Trump\</i\> \<i\>bowed to pressure by signing
    an executive order\</i\> \<i\>halting family separations.\</i\>
    \<i\>He tried to place the blame on Congress\</i\> \<i\>for a
    practice that his own administration\</i\> \<i\>had put into
    place.\</i\> \<i\>And in San Diego, the federal judge\</i\> \<i\>in
    the Ms. L lawsuit not only ruled\</i\> \<i\>that the separations
    were unconstitutional,\</i\> \<i\>but also that the families had to
    be reunited\</i\> \<i\>under tight deadlines.\</i\> \<i\>WOMAN
    REPORTER: Overnight, a federal judge ordering\</i\> \<i\>the
    government to reunite... MALE REPORTER: Families need\</i\> \<i\>to
    be reunited within 30 days.\</i\> - The legal standard is, does it
    shock the conscience uh, to do what the government did here, and the
    court held that it did. \<i\>CAITLIN: But this was just the
    beginning\</i\> \<i\>of a long process for these families.\</i\>
    WOMAN: Come on. \<i\>CAITLIN: Despite the court\</i\> \<i\>order to
    reunite families\</i\> \<i\>as quickly as possible... \</i\>WOMAN:
    Constantin. \<i\>CAITLIN: Government lawyers halted\</i\>
    \<i\>Constantin’s departure from the US.\</i\> \<i\>\[tense
    music\]\</i\> \<i\>After four months of being detained,\</i\>
    \<i\>Vasile was allowed to return to Romania,\</i\> \<i\>but without
    Constantin.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: As the Mutus waited,\</i\> \<i\>so
    did hundreds of other families.\</i\> \<i\>REPORTER: More than 2,000
    children, HHS says,\</i\> \<i\>are still separated from their
    parents.\</i\> \<i\>CAITLIN: These government photos\</i\>
    \<i\>provided some of the few glimpses\</i\> \<i\>the public had
    into the mass shelters\</i\> \<i\>where children were being
    held.\</i\> \<i\>REPORTER: We’re learning that so many of these
    children\</i\> \<i\>aren’t even by the border anymore.\</i\>
    \<i\>REPORTER: It is still not clear, though if, when, or how\</i\>
    \<i\>they will be reunited. CAITLIN: When the judge\</i\>
    \<i\>ordered the government to reunite the families,\</i\> \<i\>it
    became clear that there was no plan.\</i\> - I think that’s when
    everybody realized how defective the record keeping had been. Right?
    There was a kind of mad scramble to go through records, thousands of
    records, by hand to try to identify who went with whom.

    Constantin was reaching for me, and I ended up hiding behind the

**Producer/Director** Sweta Vohra

The youngest known child taken from his parents at the U.S.-Mexico
border was a 4-month-old baby named Constantin Mutu. While he was sent
to Michigan to live with a foster family, his father was sent to a
detention facility and ultimately deported to Romania, uncertain when he
would see his son again.

Caitlin Dickerson, an immigration correspondent for The Times, found
Constantin, one of thousands of children separated under the Trump
administration’s “zero-tolerance” border policy. [In the latest episode
of “The
Weekly,”](https://www.hulu.com/watch/3ce1b4ba-f32d-4a72-8406-40ab36e48bef)
she reveals how he spent five tumultuous months away from those who
loved him
most.

**Vasile and Florentina Mutu** received medical treatment for physical
and emotional harm they say they experienced as a result of their
separation from Constantin. The Mutus are pursuing a claim for damages
against the United States.

### <span>Episode highlights </span>

  - Constantin’s parents, Vasile and Florentina Mutu, left their home in
    Romania with two of their five children in early 2018 for Mexico,
    with plans to seek asylum in the United States.

  - They lost each other in Mexico. After U.S. border agents apprehended
    Vasile and baby Constantin in Texas, his wife and their 4-year-old
    son returned to Romania from Mexico.

<!-- end list -->

  - Vasile, who had a criminal record, said he was pressed to drop his
    request for asylum.

<!-- end list -->

  - Constantin was one of thousands of children separated from their
    families at the border under the administration’s immigration
    policy. As President Trump bowed to pressure and signed an executive
    order haltng separations, a judge acceded to a lawsuit seeking to
    reunite families, paving the way for Constantin’s return to Romania.

<!-- end list -->

  - Caitlin tracked Constantin’s case for “The Weekly,” going to
    Michigan to visit with the family charged with caring for
    Constantin, and traveling to Romania to see the Mutus.

    Caitlin first came across information about a 4-month-old baby in a
    federal court document, which indicated the baby’s age and the
    father’s status as deported. However, there was no name and no
    country of origin for the child. Caitlin began calling immigration
    lawyers and advocates, and finally confirmed that he was indeed the
    youngest child known to have been separated from his family. Several
    months later, she learned that he had been in Michigan, and
    contacted his pro bono legal representatives. This was how she found
    Constantin
    Mutu.

    in Olteni, Romania. Nicolas Mutu, in the blue shirt, traveled with
    his father, Vasile; his mother, Florentina; and his baby brother,

    Vasile Mutu, Constantin’s father, told us that he couldn’t sleep,
    refused to eat and constantly wept while he was in a detention

    Constantin’s foster family was extremely nervous to speak to us, but
    they felt that Constantin’s story was too important to keep quiet.
    When they sat down with us, the foster dad said, “I hope you have a

## Listen to ‘The Daily’: The Brief, Controversial Tenure of Kirstjen Nielsen

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Rachel Quester, Jessica Cheung and Eric Krupke, and edited by Paige Cowett

#### As homeland security secretary, she enacted and publicly defended the family separation policy. In President Trump’s eyes, she didn’t go far enough.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
    
    Today: The secretary of homeland security was forced out of her job,
    even after carrying out and defending President Trump’s most
    restrictive immigration policies. Why that wasn’t enough.
    
    It’s Tuesday, April 9.
    
    Caitlin, describe what happened over the weekend.

  - caitlin dickerson  
    So on Sunday, Kirstjen Nielsen, who’s the secretary of the
    Department of Homeland Security — she’s the nation’s highest-ranking
    immigration officer — she goes to the White House for an unscheduled
    meeting with President Trump.

  - michael barbaro  
    Caitlin Dickerson covers immigration for The Times.

  - caitlin dickerson  
    And he, in recent weeks, has been very riled up publicly over an
    increasing number of people crossing the border, especially families
    who seek asylum who have legal protections that mean they have to be
    allowed into the country. So the secretary arrives at her meeting
    with a list of ideas for how to address this problem, and she thinks
    she and the president are going to come up with a way forward. But
    instead, a few hours later, the president sends a tweet announcing
    that she will be leaving her job.

  - archived recording 1  
    Breaking news here on CNN. From the White House, the secretary of
    homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, has resigned.

  - archived recording 2  
    President Trump made the announcement via Twitter.

  - archived recording 3  
    In a tweet, the president said, quote, “Secretary of homeland
    security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would
    like to thank her for her service.”

  - archived recording 4  
    So it appears that the president is swinging the revolving door yet
    again, trying to install new people in his administration to carry
    out his bidding.

michael barbaro

That sounds like a meeting that went very poorly for the secretary.

caitlin dickerson

Clearly, they were not able to come up with a solution that both could
agree on.

michael barbaro

And by tweeting her resignation, I think what we’re politely suggesting
is that he fired her.

caitlin dickerson

Fired her. Yes, exactly.

michael barbaro

So what is the history between President Trump and Secretary Nielsen?

caitlin dickerson

So Secretary Nielsen takes her job at the end of 2017. She’s replacing
her former boss, John Kelly, who went to be President Trump’s chief of
staff. And she takes on this role as basically the person who has to
approve any new policy that’s going to be introduced along the border.
And it’s at this period of time when, I think, the President is settling
into his role. He’s fired up about really coming up with some hard
evidence that he can point to ahead of the midterm elections, for
example, and say, look, I’m keeping my campaign promises, and I’m
lowering immigration really dramatically. So right away, she’s faced
with aggressive ideas for how to prevent people from coming to the
United States, and the first one is family separation.

michael barbaro

And what do we know about how Nielsen responds to that very
controversial policy when it is first introduced to her?

caitlin dickerson

She slow-walks it. We reported in December of 2017 that a family
separation policy had reached her desk for that final signature, and it
took her four months to approve it, during which time she and President
Trump clashed quite a bit. She had questions about the legality of it.
She had questions about the practicality and how the public was going to
respond. And she had just a lot of reservations about moving forward.
But ultimately, she agreed, and the policy was introduced in a formal
way in April.

  - archived recording 1  
    Quit separating the kids\! They’re separating the children. Mr.
    President, don’t you have kids? Don’t you have kids, Mr. President?

  - archived recording 2  
    I don’t believe in this. This is not America. This is not our
    country. This is not what we should be doing.

  - archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)  
    This administration did not create a policy of separating families
    at the border.

  - archived recording  
    Shame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay
    at the other side of the border, fearing death, and allow the
    secretary to come here and lie.

  - archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)  
    Calling me a liar are fighting words. I’m not a liar. We’ve never
    had a policy for family separation. And let’s be clear — if an
    American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they
    would go to jail, and they would be separated from their family.
    This is not a controversial idea.

caitlin dickerson

Internally, she’s, if not resisting, she’s certainly questioning and
slowing down a lot of these policies. And then, externally, to the
public, she’s having to defend them and really look like the face of
them, and that ends up being something that she does actually over and
over again in her job.

michael barbaro

And remind us what ends up happening to the family separation policy.

caitlin dickerson

So President Trump stopped the practice himself by signing an executive
order.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    I consider it to be a very important executive order. It’s about
    keeping families together.

caitlin dickerson

But it didn’t matter, because a few days later, a federal judge
intervened, deemed the practice unconstitutional, and he didn’t stop
there. He said that —

  - archived recording  
    Families who have been separated as a result of the Trump
    administration’s zero-tolerance policy be reunited within 30 days.
    The order says kids under 5 must be back with their parents within
    14 days from now.

caitlin dickerson

So sort of a resounding disavowal of this policy.

michael barbaro

By the legal system.

caitlin dickerson

Exactly. And so even though she’d pushed back against it, Secretary
Nielsen ends up taking the blame.

michael barbaro

So what’s another example something that she expresses internal qualms
about but then goes out and defends publicly?

caitlin dickerson

So one of the next policies to be introduced was an idea to limit asylum
pretty significantly so that people could only apply if they showed up
at a legal port of entry — whereas beforehand, people could and did very
often show up anywhere along the border, present themselves to a border
agency, ask for protection, and they were ushered into this legal
process. The idea was to say, you can’t do that anymore. You have to
show up at a specific office, which is, of course, a pretty tall order
for somebody who’s coming from Central America with maybe a cell phone,
maybe not, not a whole lot of resources. They don’t always know exactly
where these offices exist.

  - archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)  
    You do not need to break the law of this country by entering
    illegally to claim asylum. If you are seeking asylum, go to a port
    of entry.

caitlin dickerson

But as Nielsen pointed out to the president, it was very hard to
justify, because immigration law explicitly says that you can request
asylum regardless of where you enter.

michael barbaro

So again, Nielsen is saying inside the White House, hey, this might not
be legal. I have reservations about it. But it nevertheless gets
implemented. And as you’ve said, she’s the decider. So she signs off on
it.

caitlin dickerson

Exactly. And it’s important to point out that when Nielsen pushed back
against President Trump, it wasn’t a reflection of her being a liberal
on immigration or having a more sympathetic view toward asylum seekers.
She just happened to be the face of an entire agency full of people who
work in immigration enforcement but who still made clear to her that
there were going to be legal and logistical roadblocks to putting these
ideas into place.

michael barbaro

And what happens to that port of entry policy that would limit the
number of locations that people can apply for asylum?

caitlin dickerson

Very quickly after, it’s blocked by federal courts, and it remains that
way.

  - archived recording  
    A district court ruled that the ban conflicts with immigration law.

caitlin dickerson

So this was the executive branch trying to very clearly contradict laws
that were approved by the legislative branch.

  - archived recording  
    And now the Supreme Court has refused to step in to unblock the ban.

michael barbaro

So her legal reservations are well-founded. In other words, her advice
to the president is correct, even if it’s ignored.

caitlin dickerson

That’s right. Her analysis is sound, because each time she is pushed
back, she’s been right. And these ideas have been blocked.

michael barbaro

Do any of these policies that we’re describing — family separation,
limiting the locations at which people can seek asylum — do any of them
succeed in curbing the flow of migrants, even for the very short period
of time that they’re in place before they are legally challenged?

caitlin dickerson

They don’t.

  - archived recording  
    New numbers show a 400 percent — 4-0-0, that is — 400 percent
    increase over just last year.

caitlin dickerson

Last October, we saw a record number of families seek asylum in the
United States. This is after family separation is introduced. And every
month since then, the numbers have gotten even higher.

  - archived recording  
    C.B.P. officials say Border Patrol agents are on pace for
    apprehensions and encounters with more than 100,000 migrants in
    March.

michael barbaro

So not only are these policies being blocked in court, for the very
short bit of time that they were ever in place, they’re not doing their
job of limiting the flow of migrants.

caitlin dickerson

They’re not. The numbers keep going up. And some people would argue that
maybe the policies weren’t left in place for long enough to show any
concrete outcome, and we can’t know that for sure. But what we do know
is that these policies that Nielsen was pushing back on, saying they’re
not going to work, didn’t work. And the numbers have continued to rise.

michael barbaro

And so what does that do to the president’s relationship to Nielsen?
She’s in a sense being vindicated, but the problem she’s there to
solve is only getting worse.

caitlin dickerson

She’s simultaneously sort of being vindicated if you look at it from a
legal standpoint, but from a relationship standpoint, she’s the face, in
President Trump’s eyes, of these failures.

  - archived recording 1  
    Kirstjen Nielsen appears to be on shaky ground. That’s according to
    a New York Times report. Nielsen told colleagues that she was close
    to resigning Wednesday after being berated by the president in front
    of the entire cabinet.

  - archived recording 2  
    Nothing sets him off more than immigration, and I’m told that
    meeting on Wednesday in the cabinet room was very heated, was
    incredibly heated. She spoke back to him about it, tried to defend
    herself.

caitlin dickerson

So it’s in this context of the policies that are being introduced being
blocked in the courts, the number of people crossing the border rising,
and Trump’s relationship with Secretary Nielsen falling apart that he
comes up with his most aggressive idea yet.

  - archived recording  
    Another day, another threat from President Trump, and today, he is
    threatening to shut down the southern border.

caitlin dickerson

Where he wants to completely seal the border, 100 percent. Not let
anybody come into the U.S.

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    And if they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border. We’ll close
    it, and we’ll keep it closed for a long time. I’m not playing games.

michael barbaro

And how exactly would that work?

caitlin dickerson

Well, we shouldn’t assume that the president had any particular policy
in his mind when he tweeted that he wanted to seal the border. We can
assume, though, that he wasn’t talking about, for example, cargo moving
back and forth or people with actual visas and permission to come into
the United States, but really that he’s talking about shutting down
asylum and shutting down the ability of people who don’t previously have
permission to come into the United States. And the policy that we know
has come closest to achieving that goal, one that’s been kicking around
in Washington for some months now, would be to get rid of asylum as we
know it. It would no longer allow anyone to apply for asylum in the
United States. And instead, people who needed that status or wanted that
status would have to stay in their home country, similar to the way that
Syrian refugees apply to come to the United States — apply from home,
wait many months, go through lots of vetting and background checks, and
then only if they’re approved, they would be allowed to come here.

michael barbaro

And I guess, what could be a more extreme version of limiting asylum
than literally telling people, you cannot come to this country and apply
for asylum?

caitlin dickerson

I don’t think there is a more extreme version, because I think this idea
means eliminating asylum. It goes away.

michael barbaro

And as best we understand it, what was Secretary Nielsen’s response to
this idea?

caitlin dickerson

From what we know, it’s been very similar to the way she reacted to
family separation, to that idea to significantly limit asylum to the
ports of entry, which is that this is going to be challenged by the
courts immediately. It’s going to be a huge lift to get a policy like
this introduced, to work out the logistics, and all of it will be for
naught, because it’ll be enjoined by the courts. And it’s that
oppositional and resistant stance that she’s in when she walks into the
White House for her meeting with the president.

It’s unclear who threw up their hands first or second, or whether they
both did it, but what we know is that the president did not leave her
with an option, that he, at least, decided this isn’t going to work.
You’re out. And she was by the end of that night.

And so what that means is the homeland security secretary who oversaw
some of the most controversial and aggressive immigration policies this
country has ever seen — even she wasn’t aggressive enough for President
Trump. And so now she’s gone, and he’s looking for a replacement who
will go even further.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

So Caitlin, who is the president turning to to replace Nielsen as he
looks for somebody to go further than she was willing to go?

caitlin dickerson

He’s turning to Kevin McAleenan, who’s currently the head of United
States Customs and Border Protection. That’s the agency that oversees
both the customs officers who you meet at the airport when you’ve gone
on vacation abroad and then the Border Patrol. Those are the police, the
boots on the ground along the border. And McAleenan is known as sort of
a policy wonk, a really smart and reasonable guy who’s willing to work
with Democrats, and somebody who served under President Obama as well.
He’s got more than 10 years of experience at the agency. People know him
as this reasonable guy. But when you dig a little bit deeper, McAleenan
was inspired to get into homeland security work right after 9/11. And at
C.B.P., especially most recently when he was overseeing this agency, it
really became known as the sort of policy engine with him at the center
of it coming up with ways to turn President Trump’s ideas into actual
policies that could be carried out. If D.H.S. is this agency run out of
Washington that’s overseeing all of this work, it was McAleenan’s staff
members that were actually physically taking children away from their
parents, that were physically turning asylum seekers away at the border
or telling them to go elsewhere or to wait in line. So now he’s moving
into this role where he’s got even more power, but I think we can expect
that he’ll continue to do what he was doing before, which was take
President Trump’s ideas that are sort of extreme and that aren’t
necessarily encumbered by the immigration laws, norms, history, and
he’ll try to translate them into something that’s practical and that
can be introduced on the ground.

michael barbaro

So even though he might seem moderate at first glance, he’s actually
someone who the president trusts to put these more restrictive, maybe
even extreme policies into practice. And he’s been involved in doing
that already. Now he’s being elevated to do it at an even higher level.

caitlin dickerson

Exactly.

michael barbaro

And I guess that all makes sense. If Nielsen is seen as too reluctant to
put these policies into practice, then the president would turn to
somebody who is willing to do that.

caitlin dickerson

That’s right, who is willing to try. But remember that McAleenan is
going to run up against the exact same legal framework and logistical
challenges that anybody else in that role is going to.

michael barbaro

Right. So if these policies are going to run into legal trouble in the
courts, regardless of who is leading the agency, what does it matter, in
the end, if the leader of the Department of Homeland Security is gung-ho
about the President’s policies or is reluctantly saying yes, as Nielsen
was?

caitlin dickerson

I think you can look at that question a couple of different ways. On one
hand, you’re right that it’s not going to make a huge difference who’s
sitting in the office at the head of the Homeland Security Department,
because no matter what they introduce, if it violates the immigration
law, they’re going to wind up in court. But another way of looking at it
is family separation only existed as an official sort of policy for
what, 45 days under zero tolerance? Not a very long period of time
before it had to end. But still, I don’t think that very many people are
going to argue that family separation was a small thing or something
that didn’t affect very many people. I mean, I think it had a huge
impact. So I do think that if you have a hawk running the Homeland
Security Department, even when they’re sort of encumbered by the
existing legal framework, they can make some pretty big changes, even
if, ultimately, those changes wind up in court. I think that Kevin
McAleenan has two things going for him in President Trump’s eyes. The
first, like we said, is that he knows the policies and he knows the
situation on the ground like the back of his hand. And the second thing
is that he’s shown a willingness to follow President Trump’s lead, and
so he may be the person who’s best positioned to come up with the most
legal ways to achieve President Trump’s goals. And even if the policies
that he comes up with don’t remain in place in the long term, they might
at least exist long enough to give President Trump something to point to
and show his supporters when they ask, where are you on these campaign
promises? Where are you on this idea of, if not sealing the border,
significantly decreasing the number of immigrants coming to the United
States?

michael barbaro

So even if these policies are ultimately blocked by the courts, it feels
like it’s important to this president to have someone at the Department
of Homeland Security who is willing to try them, and that may be enough.

caitlin dickerson

I think in President Trump’s heart of hearts, right, he would hope that
he would find not only somebody who is willing to try but somebody who
is going to succeed. He wants aggressive policies to be instituted in
the long term. But I think it’s better in his mind than nothing to have
somebody who’s willing to try. And as we know, politically, it’s better
than nothing, because then the president can point to these policies
that he tried to introduce, if only it wasn’t for the courts who had
blocked him, or if only it wasn’t for Congress who blocked him.

michael barbaro

Right. My intention was there. Somebody else is at fault for it not
working.

caitlin dickerson

Exactly. He has at least an attempt to meet these campaign promises to
point to when voters ask, why haven’t you made a significant change? So
I think that having a more aggressive leader in place who’s more willing
to introduce these policies, when they get stuck in the courts, it
allows Trump to blame the courts rather than his own administration for
getting in his way. He can say, look, I tried, but these judges are
blocking me, whereas it wasn’t just the judges blocking him with
Secretary Nielsen. It was her, too.

michael barbaro

If Congress is not going to change the law, and I think the assumption
is that they are not going to do that anytime soon when it comes to
basic immigration law, is the president right to suggest that the
current system is broken, and the only way to fix it is to test these
new ideas, even if they push the boundaries of the law?

caitlin dickerson

I would say yes to the first part of your question. Most people agree
that the system is broken. But when it comes to fixing the problem, what
are you trying to fix? In the president’s mind, the problem is the vast
number of people coming here to seek asylum. His idea of a fix would
decrease that number. But other people see the problem as not that
people are coming here to seek asylum at all but the ways that we’re
dealing with them. We don’t have space to place people physically in
custody when they enter. We don’t have judges to hear their cases for
years and years. So if you see that as the problem, then —

michael barbaro

He’s not really addressing those.

caitlin dickerson

He’s not addressing those problems, and I think that’s because a lot of
people who agree with the president are concerned that if we come up
with better systems for processing asylum seekers — we make it more
organized and efficient and, in some cases, comfortable — that all that
will do is encourage more and more people to come. And again, if the
numbers themselves are what you see as the problem, then making the
system better only makes it worse.

michael barbaro

Caitlin, what does all of this tell us about where President Trump plans
to go on immigration?

caitlin dickerson

I think it shows that President Trump is going to continue full steam
ahead to achieve his immigration goals and that if there are people,
even informed career officials, who want to stand in the way of that,
they’re going to be pushed out, because he’s very committed to the goal
of limiting the number of people who come to the border, regardless of
the many legal challenges he’s already faced, those that are sure to
come, the public reaction, all these other things notwithstanding. We’re
not seeing any signs of slowing down. I think this week is actually an
indicator of a ramping up of these goals.

michael barbaro

In other words, the gloves are coming off, even though, in a lot of
people’s minds, they thought the gloves were already off.

caitlin dickerson

That’s right. It’s like another set of gloves are coming off.

michael barbaro

Caitlin, thank you very much.

caitlin dickerson

Thank you.

michael barbaro

On Monday, The Times reported that President Trump plans to push out
more officials from the Department of Homeland Security, including the
department’s general counsel and the director of U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services, as he seeks to carry out his harder-line approach
to immigration. A few hours later, in the latest legal setback to that
approach, a federal judge blocked a Trump administration policy that
required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico rather than in the U.S.
while their cases made their way through U.S. immigration court. The
judge found that the policy violated federal law.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (mike pompeo)  
    Today, the United States is continuing to build its maximum pressure
    campaign against the Iranian regime. I am announcing our intent to
    designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including its Quds
    Force, as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with
    Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

michael barbaro

On Monday, the Trump administration said that it was designating a
powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist
organization, the first time that the U.S. has classified part of any
country’s government as such a threat.

  - archived recording (mike pompeo)  
    We’re doing it because the Iranian regime’s use of terrorism as a
    tool of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other
    government.

michael barbaro

The move was debated at the highest levels of the administration, with
top officials at the Defense Department and the C.I.A. opposing the
designation, arguing it could justify Iranian attacks against the U.S.
and its allies. But the president’s national security adviser, John
Bolton, and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, advocated for the
decision, arguing the designation would further isolate Iran by
discouraging businesses from working with its military.

  - archived recording (mike pompeo)  
    This historic step will deprive the world’s leading state sponsor of
    terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the
    world.

michael barbaro

In response, Iran’s government said it was designating the U.S. Central
Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, as a
terrorist organization as well.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.
