  \textless{}i\textgreater{}WOMAN: Hey Buddy. Are you happy,
  happy?\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
  This is Constantin Mutu.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Five months of his life were
  documented\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}through these
  images.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}At just
  four months old he was taken from his
  father\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}at the
  United States Border, making him the youngest
  child\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}to be
  separated by the Trump Administration.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}But there were thousands of
  children\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}separated like
  him.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} All right, thanks for calling back.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}My name is Caitlin
  Dickerson.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}I'm a
  national immigration reporter\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}for The New York Times.
  \textless{}/i\textgreater{}And you need that to give credence to the
  report, right? \textless{}i\textgreater{}Constantin's separation took
  place\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}at the same
  time I was reporting\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}on family separations at the US
  border.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}I'm going
  to tell you how my reporting helped to
  uncover\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}one of
  the Trump Administration's\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}most contentious policies. {[}baby
  cooing{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}And how
  that policy altered one infant's life.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Even before Constantin was
  born,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}the plans
  that would come to upend his life\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}were already in
  motion.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}WOMAN:
  The fears are growing in the face\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}of President Trump's plans to step
  up\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}immigration
  law enforcement.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: A new
  administration\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}had set its sights on the southern US
  border\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}calling
  the situation a threat to national
  security.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}JEFF
  SESSIONS: They are violating the law\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and they need to be
  prosecuted.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: The number of people seeking asylum
  was increasing.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}That included
  families\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}who
  would not ultimately qualify to stay.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}MAN: Are department of Homeland Security
  personnel\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}gonna
  separate the children from their moms and
  dads?\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}JEFF:
  We---we have tremendous...\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: So Trump officials were working
  on\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}an aggressive
  plan to stop people\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}from crossing the
  border.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}- Yes, I
  am considering in order to deter,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}uh, more movement along this terribly
  dangerous network...\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: One idea was to separate
  children\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}from
  their families. - Exactly that.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: After a backlash, the
  administration\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}publicly retreated from the
  idea.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}But soon
  after I got a tip\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}that it was still moving forward behind
  closed doors.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Sources said the White House favored the
  policy\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and plans
  were being drafted to separate families,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and to justify the separations
  legally.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}That was when
  we published\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}our
  first story on separations.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Meanwhile, thousands of
  miles\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}from
  Washington Constantin's family was making\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}their own plans to come to the United
  States.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} 276 is what we're looking for.
  Vasile? - Yes. - I'm Caitlin. Hi. - Hi.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: I'd first come
  across\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}the
  mention of a four-month-old baby\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}in court
  documents.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: I was struck by his
  age\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and quickly
  confirmed he was\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}the youngest separated
  child.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
  So I started searching\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}for him and his
  family.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
  Constantin was from Romania.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}The vast majority of people affected by this
  policy\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}were from
  Central America...\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}but Constantin's experience reflects the
  stories\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}of
  thousands of families, from El Salvador,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}to Mexico, to
  Romania.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
  The Mutus live at the far end of a village\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}in a shared family
  home.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Constantin's parents, Vasile and
  Florentina,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}got
  married when they were teenagers.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: The Mutus are
  Roma,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}which means
  they're part of a community\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}that has long faced
  discrimination\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}in
  many parts of the world.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: They said their children were
  harassed\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}in
  school and that they struggled to find jobs\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and receive treatment when they went to the
  hospital.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Vasile and Florentina told me that,
  like many Roma,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}their families had taken odd
  jobs\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and often
  begged for money across Europe\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}to support
  themselves.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}The Mutus knew
  other people in their community\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}who had claimed asylum in the United
  States,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}so they
  made plans to do the same.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: They decided to travel with
  Constantin\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and
  his four-year-old brother.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Their older children would join them
  later.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}The flew
  to Mexico on February 8th, 2018,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and boarded a bus to the US
  border.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Right
  before they arrived, the bus accidentally
  left\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Florentina
  and their older son behind at a rest stop.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Vasile was alone with
  Constantin.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}He
  couldn't reach Florentina\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}so he decided to cross the
  bridge\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}into
  Brownsville, Texas, a legal port of entry,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and wait for his
  wife.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
  For several hours, he waited with
  Constantin\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}with
  no understanding\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}of the political context he'd just walked
  into.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Vasile
  says that border patrol agents\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}didn't explain why they were taking
  Constantin,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}or
  where he was going.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: After Vasile and his son were
  separated,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Constantin was placed in the care of the US
  Government.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}At
  four months old, he was served this notice\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}to appear before an immigration
  judge.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Three days
  later,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}government
  workers flew him here\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}to western
  Michigan.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}tense music{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  Do you remember the first time you heard about Constantin? - Yes,
  there was just a lot of surprise and skepticism. Everyone trying to
  figure out, like, how--- who is bringing this infant, how are we going
  to get him here, we've never had a kid this young, and so that was...
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Ana Devereaux and Camila
  Trefftz\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}work with
  a legal aid organization\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}that typically represents kids who cross the
  border\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}without
  their parents.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} What did you guys know about
  family separation... \textless{}i\textgreater{}But in the months
  before Constantin arrived,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}they began to see children who had crossed
  with a parent,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}but then were
  separated.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - Five to seven-year-olds that
  were coming, um, that would tell us, ``I was separated from my
  parent.'' We were seeing it more and more consistently without really
  understanding what the trends were or why it was happening.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Like a lot of these
  kids,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Constantin
  arrived in Michigan with no information\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}about where his parents were or how to
  contact them.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}An entire team
  began to work on his case.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I think the age gave all of us a sense of urgency of trying to
    figure out what was going on. \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
    Florentina decided that it wasn't safe\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}to cross the border, so she returned to
    Romania.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Meanwhile, Vasile was detained in
    Texas.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}He had
    past convictions for fraud,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}one that involved
    robbery,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}but
    it's not clear if that's how officials\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}justified separating him from
    Constantin.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}For
    nearly two weeks, Vasile and Florentina\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}didn't know where their baby
    was.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
    Vasile was provided almost no translation
    services\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}at the
    detention center.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}He withdrew his asylum
    application\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}thinking that it would help
    him\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}get
    Constantin back more quickly.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Instead, he spent the next four months in
    detention.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: The same month that
    Constantin\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}arrived in
    Michigan,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}the
    American Civil Liberties Union\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}told me that they were about to file a
    lawsuit\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}on
    behalf of a mother who had been separated\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}from her seven-year-old
    daughter.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}This
    woman became known as Ms. L.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}And her lawsuit eventually became a class
    action\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}on
    behalf of all separated parents.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} And what
    happened after you filed the lawsuit? - So, when we filed the
    national class action we had Ms. L but we also had affidavits from a
    number of other parents describing what happened to them in vivid
    detail and what we were hearing was that family separation was
    increasing. \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Officials continued to
    deny\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}that they
    were separating families.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}But then I learned of an internal
    government document.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}A list of separated children created to
    help\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}find their
    parents within the federal system.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}A government spokesperson first
    denied\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}the list
    was accurate,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}but several inside
    sources\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}told me
    that it was.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Ultimately, officials confirmed the
    document\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}for
    the record...\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}and we published our
    story.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}At that
    point, the list had more than 700 names.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Lee: The first question from the judge
    was,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} ``Is the `New York Times' report
    correct that there are now 700 families separated?'' I think it
    really got the judge's attention, because he then recognized the Ms.
    L situation was not a one off, it wasn't a handful of cases, that we
    were looking at a potential humanitarian crisis here. - I have put
    in place zero-tolerance policy... \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
    It took another two weeks\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}before then Attorney General Jeff
    Sessions\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}made
    this announcement.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - If you cross the
    border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling
    a child then we will prosecute you, and that child may be separated
    from you as required by law. \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: The
    country would soon find out\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}what this
    meant.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}tense
    music{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: As Trump's zero-tolerance
    policy\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}went
    into effect, hundreds more children\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}were funneled into government
    custody.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Some
    went into mass shelters\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}while some of the youngest and most
    vulnerable\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}were
    placed in foster homes.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Constantin was placed in the care of a
    Michigan family\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}who after months of
    negotiation\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}agreed to speak with
    us.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}baby
    crying{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{} WOMAN: Oh, yeah. He would do
    new sounds. They only do it for a short amount of time so you want
    his mom to be able to hear that. - And what do you remember of the
    first time that you met him?
  \item
    He was all bundled up and it was nighttime so, the next morning our
    girls wanted to see him. So they crept into his room and were like,
    ''{[}gasping{]} Look at him!'' - And what did he...
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}For security
    reasons\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}foster
    families are generally barred\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}from talking to the
    media.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}We
    agreed not to reveal this family's
    identity\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}so
    they could speak about Constantin.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} MAN:
    Different things go through you mind. You don't know what his
    personality will be like. WOMAN: Even four-month-old babies, you
    have to get to know them. MAN: That looks like an earlier picture,
    too. WOMAN: He doesn't have his curls yet. CAITLIN: His hair got
    curly at some point? WOMAN: Yeah, yeah. \textless{}i\textgreater{}I
    think for me, every time Constantin
    would...\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}you
    know, like he started sitting up\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}or he started to feed himself or, you
    know,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}when he
    started to really, like, interact.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Um...\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}I would always think, it breaks my
    heart\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}that his
    mom is missing this moment.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}somber
    music{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
    ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}MAN: The hard
    part about taking care of him\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}was knowing that he wasn't being taken
    care of\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}by the
    people that took such good care of him\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}before he came to see
    us.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}WOMAN: You
    know, he has a loving family in...\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}WOMAN: Baby!\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}WOMAN: Baby!\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Constantin was growing
    up\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}with another
    family across the world.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} WOMAN: Baby! -
    {[}giggling{]} \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: And as their bond
    grew...\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}a
    chaotic political moment unfolded around all of
    them.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Families
    arriving at the border\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}now faced a new
    directive.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}The
    numbers of separated children were
    growing.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Parents would end up thousands of miles
    apart\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}from
    their children with no way of
    communicating.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAMILA: We were trying to find
    parents,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}trying
    to contact detention facilities,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} meeting
    with kids and having them sob uncontrollably in our offices.
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}SCOTT: Parents are in ICE adult
    detention\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}trying to find their
    children,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} and there's no process for
    putting them back together. Nobody at ICE has the phone number of
    the shelter that the kids have been sent to.
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Scott Shuchart worked in
    the\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Department

    processing\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}hundreds of complaints a
    month,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}but even
    they were in the dark\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}about how to track these

    \textless{}i\textgreater{}MAN: Across the country, outrage is

    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: That summer, family

    months of contradicting statements\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}from the
    administration,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen
    Nielsen\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}gave an
    official explanation.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} So in the last
    three months we have seen illegal immigration on our southern border
    exceed 50,000 people each month, \textless{}i\textgreater{}and a
    435\% increase\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}in family units entering the country
    illegally.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}As
    long illegal entry remains a criminal
    offense,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}DHS
    will not look the other way.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Illegal entry is a
    crime,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}but it's
    a low level offense that was rarely
    enforced\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}against asylum
    seekers.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Especially
    families.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}The
    Trump Administration changed that\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}by ramping up prosecutions against more
    people,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}including those traveling with
    kids.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Children
    can't be held in jails,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}so they were separated from their
    parents.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}But
    even some families who crossed the border
    legally\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}were
    separated, like Vasile and Constantin.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    REPORTER: Are you intending for parents to be separated from their
    children? Are you intending to send a message? - I---I find that
    offensive. No, because why would I ever create a policy that
    purposely does that? - It's not a policy change to enforce the law.
    That's been---that's been this administration's policy since the day
    we got here. - I think it was just overwhelming to people that what
    we were working on was a policy where people had decided that
    hurting children was a way to achieve a general immigration policy
    goal. \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}tense

    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Then two things happened in less

    We're signing an executive order. \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN:
    In Washington, President Trump\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}bowed to pressure by signing an executive
    order\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}halting
    family separations.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}He tried to place the blame on
    Congress\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}for a
    practice that his own administration\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}had put into
    place.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}And in
    San Diego, the federal judge\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}in the Ms. L lawsuit not only
    ruled\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}that the
    separations were unconstitutional,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}but also that the families had to be
    reunited\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}under
    tight deadlines.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}WOMAN REPORTER: Overnight, a federal judge
    ordering\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}the
    government to reunite... MALE REPORTER: Families
    need\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}to be
    reunited within 30 days.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - The legal
    standard is, does it shock the conscience uh, to do what the

    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: But this was just the

    \textless{}/i\textgreater{}WOMAN: Constantin.
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: Government lawyers

    without Constantin.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: As the Mutus
    waited,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}so did
    hundreds of other families.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}REPORTER: More than 2,000 children, HHS

    children were being held.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}REPORTER: We're learning that so many of
    these children\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}aren't even by the border
    anymore.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}REPORTER: It is still not clear, though
    if, when, or how\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}they will be reunited. CAITLIN: When the
    judge\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}ordered
    the government to reunite the families,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}it became clear that there was no
    plan.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - I think that's when everybody
    realized how defective the record keeping had been. Right? There was
    a kind of mad scramble to go through records, thousands of records,
    by hand to try to identify who went with whom.
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}REPORTER: There are still more than 2,000
    children\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}who
    have not been reunited.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}Some parents have already been
    deported.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}CAITLIN: I got a tip from an inside
    source\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}that
    helped to explain why.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}In processing the separations, border
    agents had deleted\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}identification numbers that could have
    been used\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}to
    track families.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}

    published this story in early July.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}LEE: And that's when the judge
    said,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} ``I want to have a hearing
    virtually every two days for the next two weeks.'' So I think the

The youngest known child taken from his parents at the U.S.-Mexico
border was a 4-month-old baby named Constantin Mutu. While he was sent
to Michigan to live with a foster family, his father was sent to a
detention facility and ultimately deported to Romania, uncertain when he
would see his son again.

Caitlin Dickerson, an immigration correspondent for The Times, found
Constantin, one of thousands of children separated under the Trump
administration's ``zero-tolerance'' border policy.

\textbf{Constantin Mutu} is 20 months old and still can't walk on his
own or talk. For weeks after he returned to Romania, he was fussy and
had trouble sleeping. His mother, Florentina, asked his foster mother
for advice on how to soothe Constantin, including what to feed him when
he was upset.

  Caitlin first came across information about a 4-month-old baby in a
  federal court document, which indicated the baby's age and the
  father's status as deported. However, there was no name and no country
  of origin for the child. Caitlin began calling immigration lawyers and
  advocates, and finally confirmed that he was indeed the youngest child
  known to have been separated from his family. Several months later,
  she learned that he had been in Michigan, and contacted his pro bono
  legal representatives. This was how she found Constantin Mutu.~

  This is Constantin Mutu's family in May 2019, outside of their home in
  Olteni, Romania. Nicolas Mutu, in the blue shirt, traveled with his
  father, Vasile; his mother, Florentina; and his baby brother,
  Constantin, to Mexico, where the family had planned to cross the U.S.
  border. Ultimately, Nicolas and Florentina never did.

  Vasile Mutu, Constantin's father, told us that he couldn't sleep,
  refused to eat and constantly wept while he was in a detention
  facility. At one point, he said, an officer offered to make a video
  call to Constantin if Vasile ate a sandwich. That was the first time
  he would see Constantin after officials took the baby away from him.

  Constantin's foster family was extremely nervous to speak to us, but
  they felt that Constantin's story was too important to keep quiet.
  When they sat down with us, the foster dad said, ``I hope you have a
  lot of time, because we have a lot to say.'' The interview lasted four
  hours.~

  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''

  Today: The secretary of homeland security was forced out of her job,
  even after carrying out and defending President Trump's most
  restrictive immigration policies. Why that wasn't enough.

  It's Tuesday, April 9.

  Caitlin, describe what happened over the weekend.
\item
  caitlin dickerson\\
  So on Sunday, Kirstjen Nielsen, who's the secretary of the Department
  of Homeland Security --- she's the nation's highest-ranking
  immigration officer --- she goes to the White House for an unscheduled
  meeting with President Trump.
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  Caitlin Dickerson covers immigration for The Times.
\item
  caitlin dickerson\\
  And he, in recent weeks, has been very riled up publicly over an
  increasing number of people crossing the border, especially families
  who seek asylum who have legal protections that mean they have to be
  allowed into the country. So the secretary arrives at her meeting with
  a list of ideas for how to address this problem, and she thinks she
  and the president are going to come up with a way forward. But
  instead, a few hours later, the president sends a tweet announcing
  that she will be leaving her job.
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Breaking news here on CNN. From the White House, the secretary of
  homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, has resigned.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  President Trump made the announcement via Twitter.
\item
  archived recording 3\\
  In a tweet, the president said, quote, ``Secretary of homeland
  security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would
  like to thank her for her service.''
\item
  archived recording 4\\
  So it appears that the president is swinging the revolving door yet
  again, trying to install new people in his administration to carry out
  his bidding.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

That sounds like a meeting that went very poorly for the secretary.

caitlin dickerson

Clearly, they were not able to come up with a solution that both could
agree on.

michael barbaro

And by tweeting her resignation, I think what we're politely suggesting
is that he fired her.

caitlin dickerson

Fired her. Yes, exactly.

michael barbaro

So what is the history between President Trump and Secretary Nielsen?

caitlin dickerson

So Secretary Nielsen takes her job at the end of 2017. She's replacing
her former boss, John Kelly, who went to be President Trump's chief of
staff. And she takes on this role as basically the person who has to
approve any new policy that's going to be introduced along the border.
And it's at this period of time when, I think, the President is settling
into his role. He's fired up about really coming up with some hard
evidence that he can point to ahead of the midterm elections, for
example, and say, look, I'm keeping my campaign promises, and I'm
lowering immigration really dramatically. So right away, she's faced
with aggressive ideas for how to prevent people from coming to the
United States, and the first one is family separation.

michael barbaro

And what do we know about how Nielsen responds to that very
controversial policy when it is first introduced to her?

caitlin dickerson

She slow-walks it. We reported in December of 2017 that a family
separation policy had reached her desk for that final signature, and it
took her four months to approve it, during which time she and President
Trump clashed quite a bit. She had questions about the legality of it.
She had questions about the practicality and how the public was going to
respond. And she had just a lot of reservations about moving forward.
But ultimately, she agreed, and the policy was introduced in a formal
way in April.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Quit separating the kids! They're separating the children. Mr.
  President, don't you have kids? Don't you have kids, Mr. President?
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  I don't believe in this. This is not America. This is not our country.
  This is not what we should be doing.
\item
  archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)\\
  This administration did not create a policy of separating families at
  the border.
\item
  archived recording\\
  Shame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at
  the other side of the border, fearing death, and allow the secretary
  to come here and lie.
\item
  archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)\\
  Calling me a liar are fighting words. I'm not a liar. We've never had
  a policy for family separation. And let's be clear --- if an American
  were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States, they would go to
  jail, and they would be separated from their family. This is not a
  controversial idea.
\end{itemize}

caitlin dickerson

Internally, she's, if not resisting, she's certainly questioning and
slowing down a lot of these policies. And then, externally, to the
public, she's having to defend them and really look like the face of
them, and that ends up being something that she does actually over and
over again in her job.

michael barbaro

And remind us what ends up happening to the family separation policy.

caitlin dickerson

So President Trump stopped the practice himself by signing an executive
order.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  I consider it to be a very important executive order. It's about
  keeping families together.
\end{itemize}

caitlin dickerson

But it didn't matter, because a few days later, a federal judge
intervened, deemed the practice unconstitutional, and he didn't stop
there. He said that ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Families who have been separated as a result of the Trump
  administration's zero-tolerance policy be reunited within 30 days. The
  order says kids under 5 must be back with their parents within 14 days
  from now.
\end{itemize}

caitlin dickerson

So sort of a resounding disavowal of this policy.

michael barbaro

By the legal system.

caitlin dickerson

Exactly. And so even though she'd pushed back against it, Secretary
Nielsen ends up taking the blame.

michael barbaro

So what's another example something that she expresses internal qualms
about but then goes out and defends publicly?

caitlin dickerson

So one of the next policies to be introduced was an idea to limit asylum
pretty significantly so that people could only apply if they showed up
at a legal port of entry --- whereas beforehand, people could and did
very often show up anywhere along the border, present themselves to a
border agency, ask for protection, and they were ushered into this legal
process. The idea was to say, you can't do that anymore. You have to
show up at a specific office, which is, of course, a pretty tall order
for somebody who's coming from Central America with maybe a cell phone,
maybe not, not a whole lot of resources. They don't always know exactly
where these offices exist.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (kirstjen nielsen)\\
  You do not need to break the law of this country by entering illegally
  to claim asylum. If you are seeking asylum, go to a port of entry.
\end{itemize}

caitlin dickerson

But as Nielsen pointed out to the president, it was very hard to
justify, because immigration law explicitly says that you can request
asylum regardless of where you enter.

michael barbaro

So again, Nielsen is saying inside the White House, hey, this might not
be legal. I have reservations about it. But it nevertheless gets
implemented. And as you've said, she's the decider. So she signs off on
it.

caitlin dickerson

Exactly. And it's important to point out that when Nielsen pushed back
against President Trump, it wasn't a reflection of her being a liberal
on immigration or having a more sympathetic view toward asylum seekers.
She just happened to be the face of an entire agency full of people who
work in immigration enforcement but who still made clear to her that
there were going to be legal and logistical roadblocks to putting these
ideas into place.

michael barbaro

And what happens to that port of entry policy that would limit the
number of locations that people can apply for asylum?

caitlin dickerson

Very quickly after, it's blocked by federal courts, and it remains that
way.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  A district court ruled that the ban conflicts with immigration law.
\end{itemize}

caitlin dickerson

So this was the executive branch trying to very clearly contradict laws
that were approved by the legislative branch.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  And now the Supreme Court has refused to step in to unblock the ban.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So her legal reservations are well-founded. In other words, her advice
to the president is correct, even if it's ignored.

caitlin dickerson

That's right. Her analysis is sound, because each time she is pushed
back, she's been right. And these ideas have been blocked.

michael barbaro

Do any of these policies that we're describing --- family separation,
limiting the locations at which people can seek asylum --- do any of
them succeed in curbing the flow of migrants, even for the very short
period of time that they're in place before they are legally challenged?

caitlin dickerson

They don't.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  New numbers show a 400 percent --- 4-0-0, that is --- 400 percent
  increase over just last year.
\end{itemize}

caitlin dickerson

Last October, we saw a record number of families seek asylum in the
United States. This is after family separation is introduced. And every
month since then, the numbers have gotten even higher.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  C.B.P. officials say Border Patrol agents are on pace for
  apprehensions and encounters with more than 100,000 migrants in March.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So not only are these policies being blocked in court, for the very
short bit of time that they were ever in place, they're not doing their
job of limiting the flow of migrants.

caitlin dickerson

They're not. The numbers keep going up. And some people would argue that
maybe the policies weren't left in place for long enough to show any
concrete outcome, and we can't know that for sure. But what we do know
is that these policies that Nielsen was pushing back on, saying they're
not going to work, didn't work. And the numbers have continued to rise.

michael barbaro

And so what does that do to the president's relationship to Nielsen?
She's in a sense being vindicated, but the problem she's there to solve
is only getting worse.

caitlin dickerson

She's simultaneously sort of being vindicated if you look at it from a
legal standpoint, but from a relationship standpoint, she's the face, in
President Trump's eyes, of these failures.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Kirstjen Nielsen appears to be on shaky ground. That's according to a
  New York Times report. Nielsen told colleagues that she was close to
  resigning Wednesday after being berated by the president in front of
  the entire cabinet.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  Nothing sets him off more than immigration, and I'm told that meeting
  on Wednesday in the cabinet room was very heated, was incredibly
  heated. She spoke back to him about it, tried to defend herself.
\end{itemize}

caitlin dickerson

So it's in this context of the policies that are being introduced being
blocked in the courts, the number of people crossing the border rising,
and Trump's relationship with Secretary Nielsen falling apart that he
comes up with his most aggressive idea yet.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  Another day, another threat from President Trump, and today, he is
  threatening to shut down the southern border.
\end{itemize}

caitlin dickerson

Where he wants to completely seal the border, 100 percent. Not let
anybody come into the U.S.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  And if they don't stop them, we're closing the border. We'll close it,
  and we'll keep it closed for a long time. I'm not playing games.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And how exactly would that work?

caitlin dickerson

Well, we shouldn't assume that the president had any particular policy
in his mind when he tweeted that he wanted to seal the border. We can
assume, though, that he wasn't talking about, for example, cargo moving
back and forth or people with actual visas and permission to come into
the United States, but really that he's talking about shutting down
asylum and shutting down the ability of people who don't previously have
permission to come into the United States. And the policy that we know
has come closest to achieving that goal, one that's been kicking around
in Washington for some months now, would be to get rid of asylum as we
know it. It would no longer allow anyone to apply for asylum in the
United States. And instead, people who needed that status or wanted that
status would have to stay in their home country, similar to the way that
Syrian refugees apply to come to the United States --- apply from home,
wait many months, go through lots of vetting and background checks, and
then only if they're approved, they would be allowed to come here.

michael barbaro

And I guess, what could be a more extreme version of limiting asylum
than literally telling people, you cannot come to this country and apply
for asylum?

caitlin dickerson

I don't think there is a more extreme version, because I think this idea
means eliminating asylum. It goes away.

michael barbaro

And as best we understand it, what was Secretary Nielsen's response to
this idea?

caitlin dickerson

From what we know, it's been very similar to the way she reacted to
family separation, to that idea to significantly limit asylum to the
ports of entry, which is that this is going to be challenged by the
courts immediately. It's going to be a huge lift to get a policy like
this introduced, to work out the logistics, and all of it will be for
naught, because it'll be enjoined by the courts. And it's that
oppositional and resistant stance that she's in when she walks into the
White House for her meeting with the president.

It's unclear who threw up their hands first or second, or whether they
both did it, but what we know is that the president did not leave her
with an option, that he, at least, decided this isn't going to work.
You're out. And she was by the end of that night.

And so what that means is the homeland security secretary who oversaw
some of the most controversial and aggressive immigration policies this
country has ever seen --- even she wasn't aggressive enough for
President Trump. And so now she's gone, and he's looking for a
replacement who will go even further.

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

So Caitlin, who is the president turning to to replace Nielsen as he
looks for somebody to go further than she was willing to go?

caitlin dickerson

He's turning to Kevin McAleenan, who's currently the head of United
States Customs and Border Protection. That's the agency that oversees
both the customs officers who you meet at the airport when you've gone
on vacation abroad and then the Border Patrol. Those are the police, the
boots on the ground along the border. And McAleenan is known as sort of
a policy wonk, a really smart and reasonable guy who's willing to work
with Democrats, and somebody who served under President Obama as well.
He's got more than 10 years of experience at the agency. People know him
as this reasonable guy. But when you dig a little bit deeper, McAleenan
was inspired to get into homeland security work right after 9/11. And at
C.B.P., especially most recently when he was overseeing this agency, it
really became known as the sort of policy engine with him at the center
of it coming up with ways to turn President Trump's ideas into actual
policies that could be carried out. If D.H.S. is this agency run out of
Washington that's overseeing all of this work, it was McAleenan's staff
members that were actually physically taking children away from their
parents, that were physically turning asylum seekers away at the border
or telling them to go elsewhere or to wait in line. So now he's moving
into this role where he's got even more power, but I think we can expect
that he'll continue to do what he was doing before, which was take
President Trump's ideas that are sort of extreme and that aren't
necessarily encumbered by the immigration laws, norms, history, and
he'll try to translate them into something that's practical and that can
be introduced on the ground.

michael barbaro

So even though he might seem moderate at first glance, he's actually
someone who the president trusts to put these more restrictive, maybe
even extreme policies into practice. And he's been involved in doing
that already. Now he's being elevated to do it at an even higher level.

caitlin dickerson

Exactly.

michael barbaro

And I guess that all makes sense. If Nielsen is seen as too reluctant to
put these policies into practice, then the president would turn to
somebody who is willing to do that.

caitlin dickerson

That's right, who is willing to try. But remember that McAleenan is
going to run up against the exact same legal framework and logistical
challenges that anybody else in that role is going to.

michael barbaro

Right. So if these policies are going to run into legal trouble in the
courts, regardless of who is leading the agency, what does it matter, in
the end, if the leader of the Department of Homeland Security is gung-ho
about the President's policies or is reluctantly saying yes, as Nielsen
was?

caitlin dickerson

I think you can look at that question a couple of different ways. On one
hand, you're right that it's not going to make a huge difference who's
sitting in the office at the head of the Homeland Security Department,
because no matter what they introduce, if it violates the immigration
law, they're going to wind up in court. But another way of looking at it
is family separation only existed as an official sort of policy for
what, 45 days under zero tolerance? Not a very long period of time
before it had to end. But still, I don't think that very many people are
going to argue that family separation was a small thing or something
that didn't affect very many people. I mean, I think it had a huge
impact. So I do think that if you have a hawk running the Homeland
Security Department, even when they're sort of encumbered by the
existing legal framework, they can make some pretty big changes, even
if, ultimately, those changes wind up in court. I think that Kevin
McAleenan has two things going for him in President Trump's eyes. The
first, like we said, is that he knows the policies and he knows the
situation on the ground like the back of his hand. And the second thing
is that he's shown a willingness to follow President Trump's lead, and
so he may be the person who's best positioned to come up with the most
legal ways to achieve President Trump's goals. And even if the policies
that he comes up with don't remain in place in the long term, they might
at least exist long enough to give President Trump something to point to
and show his supporters when they ask, where are you on these campaign
promises? Where are you on this idea of, if not sealing the border,
significantly decreasing the number of immigrants coming to the United
States?

michael barbaro

So even if these policies are ultimately blocked by the courts, it feels
like it's important to this president to have someone at the Department
of Homeland Security who is willing to try them, and that may be enough.

caitlin dickerson

I think in President Trump's heart of hearts, right, he would hope that
he would find not only somebody who is willing to try but somebody who
is going to succeed. He wants aggressive policies to be instituted in
the long term. But I think it's better in his mind than nothing to have
somebody who's willing to try. And as we know, politically, it's better
than nothing, because then the president can point to these policies
that he tried to introduce, if only it wasn't for the courts who had
blocked him, or if only it wasn't for Congress who blocked him.

michael barbaro

Right. My intention was there. Somebody else is at fault for it not
working.

caitlin dickerson

Exactly. He has at least an attempt to meet these campaign promises to
point to when voters ask, why haven't you made a significant change? So
I think that having a more aggressive leader in place who's more willing
to introduce these policies, when they get stuck in the courts, it
allows Trump to blame the courts rather than his own administration for
getting in his way. He can say, look, I tried, but these judges are
blocking me, whereas it wasn't just the judges blocking him with
Secretary Nielsen. It was her, too.

michael barbaro

If Congress is not going to change the law, and I think the assumption
is that they are not going to do that anytime soon when it comes to
basic immigration law, is the president right to suggest that the
current system is broken, and the only way to fix it is to test these
new ideas, even if they push the boundaries of the law?

caitlin dickerson

I would say yes to the first part of your question. Most people agree
that the system is broken. But when it comes to fixing the problem, what
are you trying to fix? In the president's mind, the problem is the vast
number of people coming here to seek asylum. His idea of a fix would
decrease that number. But other people see the problem as not that
people are coming here to seek asylum at all but the ways that we're
dealing with them. We don't have space to place people physically in
custody when they enter. We don't have judges to hear their cases for
years and years. So if you see that as the problem, then ---

michael barbaro

He's not really addressing those.

caitlin dickerson

He's not addressing those problems, and I think that's because a lot of
people who agree with the president are concerned that if we come up
with better systems for processing asylum seekers --- we make it more
organized and efficient and, in some cases, comfortable --- that all
that will do is encourage more and more people to come. And again, if
the numbers themselves are what you see as the problem, then making the
system better only makes it worse.

michael barbaro

Caitlin, what does all of this tell us about where President Trump plans
to go on immigration?

caitlin dickerson

I think it shows that President Trump is going to continue full steam
ahead to achieve his immigration goals and that if there are people,
even informed career officials, who want to stand in the way of that,
they're going to be pushed out, because he's very committed to the goal
of limiting the number of people who come to the border, regardless of
the many legal challenges he's already faced, those that are sure to
come, the public reaction, all these other things notwithstanding. We're
not seeing any signs of slowing down. I think this week is actually an
indicator of a ramping up of these goals.

michael barbaro

In other words, the gloves are coming off, even though, in a lot of
people's minds, they thought the gloves were already off.

caitlin dickerson

That's right. It's like another set of gloves are coming off.

michael barbaro

Caitlin, thank you very much.

caitlin dickerson

Thank you.

michael barbaro

On Monday, The Times reported that President Trump plans to push out
more officials from the Department of Homeland Security, including the
department's general counsel and the director of U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services, as he seeks to carry out his harder-line approach
to immigration. A few hours later, in the latest legal setback to that
approach, a federal judge blocked a Trump administration policy that
required those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico rather than in the U.S.
while their cases made their way through U.S. immigration court. The
judge found that the policy violated federal law.

Here's what else you need to know today.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (mike pompeo)\\
  Today, the United States is continuing to build its maximum pressure
  campaign against the Iranian regime. I am announcing our intent to
  designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including its Quds
  Force, as a foreign terrorist organization in accordance with Section
  219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

On Monday, the Trump administration said that it was designating a
powerful arm of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist
organization, the first time that the U.S. has classified part of any
country's government as such a threat.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (mike pompeo)\\
  We're doing it because the Iranian regime's use of terrorism as a tool
  of statecraft makes it fundamentally different from any other
  government.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

The move was debated at the highest levels of the administration, with
top officials at the Defense Department and the C.I.A. opposing the
designation, arguing it could justify Iranian attacks against the U.S.
and its allies. But the president's national security adviser, John
Bolton, and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, advocated for the
decision, arguing the designation would further isolate Iran by
discouraging businesses from working with its military.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (mike pompeo)\\
  This historic step will deprive the world's leading state sponsor of
  terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the
  world.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

In response, Iran's government said it was designating the U.S. Central
Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, as a
terrorist organization as well.

That's it for ``The Daily.'' I'm Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.
