In 1994, the National Football League formed a Committee on Mild
Traumatic Brain Injury to study an alarming trend: Players were retiring
early because of what seemed to be concussion-related problems,
including persistent headaches, vertigo, cognitive impairment,
personality changes, fatigue and difficulty performing ordinary daily
activities. Around the same time, Eve Valera, then a Ph.D. student in
clinical psychology at the University of Illinois, began to volunteer in
a domestic-violence shelter and wondered how many of the women there
might be experiencing comparable post-concussive symptoms as a result of
head injuries inflicted by their partners.

When Valera could not find any published studies on brain trauma related
to such violence, she decided to conduct one herself, by interviewing
the women where she volunteered. She published the results in 2003 — two
years before Bennet Omalu, then a pathologist at the University of
Pittsburgh, [reported the first known case in a deceased N.F.L. player
of chronic traumatic
encephalopathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15987548) (C.T.E.),
a neurodegenerative disease characterized by some of the same symptoms
plaguing the retired players. Three-quarters of the women, Valera found,
had received at least one traumatic brain injury (T.B.I.); half had
sustained multiple mild traumatic brain injuries.

In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates
that one in three women over the age of 15 has experienced what it
categorizes as “intimate partner violence.” When Valera extends her
sample to the overall population, she gets estimates that as many as 31
million women might have had a T.B.I. and 21 million might have had
multiple mild ones. “Using annual estimates of severe physical
violence,” Valera notes in [a study published last fall in the Journal
of
Neurotrauma](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/neu.2018.5734),
“1.6 million women can be estimated to sustain repetitive T.B.I.s in
comparison to the total annual numbers of T.B.I.s reported for the
military and N.F.L. at 18,000 and 281 respectively.”

Yet most of what scientists know about the potential prevalence and
consequences of mild traumatic brain injury has come from studying
contact sports, especially football — so, mostly men and boys — over the
past 15 years. It’s a vivid illustration of a broad and pernicious
problem in medical research, which is that some groups of people get far
more attention than others — often leading to important gaps in medical
understanding, even around conditions that the public regards as “widely
studied.”

For her study in the Journal of Neurotrauma, Valera, now a
neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School, imaged areas of white matter
thought to be involved in learning and memory in the brains of 20 women
subjected to partner violence. The brain injuries were associated with
what she believes reflects abnormalities in these brain regions. But she
says that the study had significant limitations because of meager
funding: a small sample size and no control group of women who were
assaulted by partners but did not have head trauma. Understanding the
effect of such changes over time would require expensive long-term
studies. Yet, the news that thousands of women might be dealing with
undiagnosed brain damage did not garner much attention: According to
Altmetric, which tracks the online activity generated by scientific
studies, Valera’s findings were [tweeted four
times](https://www.altmetric.com/details/43423449).

In contrast, [a 2015 study of football players’ white
matter](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/neu.2014.3822),
conducted by researchers at Boston University and published in the same
journal, was [tweeted 50
times](https://www.altmetric.com/details/4308278) and received more
widespread notice. (“Are You Ready for Some Football Brain Damage?” a
USA Today headline asked.) It compared the white matter in areas of the
brain of 20 former N.F.L. players who began playing football before age
12 with that of 20 who were the same age and started at or after age 12
and found many more abnormalities in the brains of the younger group,
suggesting for the first time that the age a person is first exposed to
football may influence his later susceptibility to brain injuries. It,
too, acknowledged the limits of its sample (small and specific) and
called for further research, much more of which has now been done,
including on youth players who never reach elite levels. “We’ve shown
over and over that it isn’t just concussions,” Ann McKee, who is the
director of Boston University’s C.T.E. Center, told me. “It’s number of
playing years.” She adds: “It’s the lower-level hits, what we call
subconcussions, that are asymptomatic, that the player plays right
through without even recognizing that he’s had an injury. Those are the
low-level hits that we’ve shown increase the risk and severity of
C.T.E.”

The media has raised alarm about these findings — so much so that other
experts worry that the media is overstating the absolute risk of
developing C.T.E. and understating the substantial health benefits that
team sports, including football, offer. In [a 2017 editorial in The
Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and
Psychiatry](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/88/6/462), Alan Carson, a
professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of Edinburgh, points to
[a 2012 study of 3,439 former N.F.L.
players](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4098841/). It
found that they died from neurodegenerative diseases at three times the
rate of the general population, but were half as likely to die of any
other cause.

The trouble with comparing N.F.L. players with the general population,
however, is that people who go on to become elite athletes may be a
healthier cohort to begin with. Their superior health may lead them to
play football, rather than it being the case that playing football
improves their health. Last month, [a new study by researchers at
Harvard sought to control for this bias by comparing N.F.L. players with
Major League Baseball
players](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2734063).
It found that the football players had higher levels of mortality from
all causes, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases,
than the baseball players did, which could indicate that football itself
was detrimental.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

All available evidence suggests that reducing exposure to tackle
football would reduce the incidence of C.T.E., which meets the criteria
of a public health concern, the authors of [a paper last year in the
journal Human and Ecological Risk
Assessment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10807039.2018.1456899)
wrote. It is hard to say how much of the lingering debate over the risks
of tackle football are a result of the N.F.L. becoming a major donor to
concussion research; in the past, the league has attempted to defund
researchers whose work shows that the accumulation of lesser hits may be
even more detrimental. “In many ways, it’s to their advantage if the
debate continues,” Philip M. Rosoff, of the Trent Center for Bioethics,
Humanities & History of Medicine at Duke University, told me. But the
paper also noted a “large and growing disconnect” between how public
health scientists read the data and how clinicians do: a pediatrician
whose young patients suffer from obesity, for example, may see football
as a risk worth taking.

But if these risks are important to understand and mitigate for the
million-plus boys playing tackle football — clearly they are — then why
have we not put equal resources into studying them in women, a
potentially vast number of whom could have been exposed to head trauma?
The implications could be profound. For example, researchers hope that
learning how C.T.E. works could help them diagnose and treat other
neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s, in which abnormal proteins
in the brain may appear decades before they eventually damage tissue and
lead to symptoms; unlike Alzheimer’s, which has no known cause, C.T.E.
now appears to have a clear starting point in head trauma, which makes
it possible to study its progression over time. (Researchers are still
searching for a way to definitively test for both diseases in a living
brain.) This progression, however, may be different in men and women. In
fact, the little research on head injuries in female athletes and
service members suggests that their brains may be more susceptible to
trauma than men’s are. Two-thirds of those who get Alzheimer’s diagnoses
are women.

Unfortunately, they may never benefit from adequate research. Part of
the problem is that women hurt by intimate partners tend to hide that
fact, making them hard to identify and study. But the bigger issue is
that public outrage and advocacy play a major role in determining what
research gets funded. In the case of head trauma, almost all the
attention is going to football — and so, by extension, to only one
gender.
