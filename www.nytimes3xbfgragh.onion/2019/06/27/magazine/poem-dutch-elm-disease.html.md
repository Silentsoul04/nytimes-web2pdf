How does Valencia Robin’s beautiful poem work its melancholy magic?
Whether in far-off Vietnam or on a nearby bridge, death is waiting in
Milwaukee. The narrator can’t stop remembering; she turns the events of
one summer over in her mind until her voice gets in our heads too. The
constant patter — desperate yet determined — is like a doomed wish, as
if you could talk some sense into memory: sorrow spilling out of a
neighbor’s house, the family staggering under a mortal anguish that
overwhelms the boundaries of the yard, the street, the city and,
finally, even time itself. *Selected by Rita

## Dutch Elm Disease

*By Valencia Robin*

When Danny Johnson’s big brother was killed in Vietnam,  
Danny ran around the block five times. I counted. Ran  
as if when he stopped his brother would be back in their driveway  
washing his car. But nobody knew anything about time travel  
back then, *Star Trek* hadn’t even come out, Lieutenant Uhura  
still on Broadway doing *Blues for Mr. Charlie*. And even if Danny  
did understand the space-time continuum, his parents  
weren’t having it, his mother on the porch yelling  
his name, his father tackling him on the front lawn, all us kids,  
the whole block standing there on pause. Which didn’t exist  
either. No fast forward, no reverse. We weren’t even Black  
yet. Was Milwaukee even Milwaukee? Is the Lincoln Park Bridge  
still there, do boys like Danny still climb over the rail,  
hug their bony knees to their narrow chests and plop into the river  
as if there’s no way his parents could lose *two* children?  
Which is all I know about Vietnam, that and the way the sun hung  
in the faded sky as Danny ran around and around  
and held the air hostage, that and the way the thick August air  
ignored the leaves of all our doomed elm trees  
and let itself be held hostage. The streets were like ghosts  
when they cut down those trees.
