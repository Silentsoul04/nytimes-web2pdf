\textbf{Matt writes:} \emph{Years ago, my sister, Brooke, borrowed a
camera lens of mine. I forgot about it until I needed it a year later.
That's when she told me she had sold it to our friend, Evan. I asked her
to replace it, and she said that because we both forgot about it, I
should just replace it myself. It cost me \$115. Having you settle a
claim that small feels petty. I want a genuine apology from her.}

You're a good brother, but I can't honor your request, because Brooke is
a bad sister. As an only child, I don't understand \emph{all} the
nuances of brother/sister relationships and the complicated psy-ops and
gaslighting that lasts well into adulthood. But my lonely status does
afford me the moral clarity to say that Brooke is a thief, and on some
level she knows it. So I order her to pay not \$115 but \$215, as
damages. Also, I would stay away from Evan if I were you. He seems like
a creep, too.
