\textbf{James writes:} \emph{My husband ignores me when I refer to our
couch as a ``couch.'' We live in England, where it is known as a sofa.
Whilst it is unusual to say ``couch'' here, I have done so for decades
without confusion. Lately he has responded to me by acting confused and
claiming we don't own a ``couch.''}

The court appreciates your dispute, as I (from Boston) have always
called it a ``sofa,'' to my own wife's confusion, and now I appreciate
that the word may be a remnant of New Englandy Englandism. In any case,
yes, England has different words for things. For example, instead of
word-that-rhymes-with-gas-hole, a Brit would say
word-that-rhymes-with-farce-hole, which is what your husband is being. I
hereby order him to cease word-that-rhymes-with-ass-lighting you, and
meanwhile, never drop ``whilst'' in my column again. You've been warned.
