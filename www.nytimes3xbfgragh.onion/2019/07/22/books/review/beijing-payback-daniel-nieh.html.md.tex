\textbf{BEIJING PAYBACK}\\
By Daniel Nieh

``Beijing Payback'' is a propulsive first novel that aims to entertain.
Victor Li, a college student whose father, Vincent, was recently killed
in a home invasion, learns from the detective on the case that the
murder might've been the work of an ``experienced killer.''

Suspects abound. The most likely seems to be Rou Qiangjun, a man who has
recently arrived in California to replace Vincent in running all four
branches of Happy Year, a Chinese restaurant in the San Gabriel Valley.

Vincent came of age during the Cultural Revolution and entered into a
blood brotherhood on the streets of Beijing. Now, the brotherhood is
responsible for an expansive smuggling endeavor and the Happy Year
restaurants serve as a cover for their United States operations. In a
letter left for Victor, Vincent reveals that he argued with the
brotherhood about Ice, the latest product they were planning to bring in
from China. ``If you are reading this letter, the worst has come to
pass,'' Vincent writes. ``Do not mourn me as a victim.'' Instead, he
wants Victor to avenge him by returning to Beijing to find evidence of
Ice and hand it over to a Western journalist there. Exposing the
operation in the international press will embarrass the government, he
says, and force them to step in and shut down the brotherhood's shady
dealings for good.

So Victor heads off to Beijing, aided by his father's former protégé,
Sun Jianshui, who it turns out is a lethal fixer. Despite the highly
capable backup, things don't go as Victor planned. Daniel Nieh packs his
novel with action, taking many of his cues from movie plots: We open
with a flash-forward; we follow Vincent and Sun as they navigate
increasingly harrowing situations that we know are leading to a final
boss lurking somewhere. But even if the book's plot moves aren't
difficult to anticipate, the details that fill them in are highly
enjoyable. Nieh clearly wants you to enjoy yourself, which makes it very
easy to forgive the occasional lines of wooden dialogue and an
overreliance on formula.

There are some interesting ideas about identity and privilege here. The
money earned from the brotherhood's illicit activities in Beijing is the
reason Vincent was able to build an idyllic life for Victor and his
sister in California. Victor grapples with the moral implications of
this with the convincing clumsiness of a sheltered 20-something. Plus,
Nieh is a Chinese-English translator and his experience in this arena is
an important feature of the text. Victor is mourning his father, and is
often reminded of Vincent's advice --- snippets of it appear throughout
the novel in Chinese and serve to remind Victor of all that he has
inherited culturally and emotionally, both for good and bad. And Victor
Li --- or Li Xiaozhou, as he is known in China --- is perceived as an
entirely different person in sleepy San Dimas than he is in Beijing's
underworld. In the lulls between high-octane fight scenes, Nieh uses the
gaps in Victor's fluency to lend realism to the experience of straddling
these two worlds.

The second half of ``Beijing Payback'' rushes through a few final action
scenes, then slows down for a clever plot twist and a brooding ending.
And it sets up a sequel, one that I very much look forward to reading.
