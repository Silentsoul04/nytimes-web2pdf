A Republican operative in North Carolina has been charged in connection
with a voter-turnout effort that investigators said was intended to
manipulate the results of a now-overturned general election for Congress
last year.

In an indictment announced on Tuesday, the operative, L. McCrae Dowless
Jr., was accused of obstruction of justice and illegal possession of an
absentee ballot, among other charges. Seven other people were also
indicted in connection with the election fraud inquiry, but prosecutors
said the charges against one person were inadvertent and would be
dismissed.

In the indictment, prosecutors alleged that Mr. Dowless directed others
in the criminal mishandling of absentee ballots and that “spoiled
absentee ballots were counted.” Mr. Dowless’s crimes, the indictment
said, “served to undermine the integrity of the absentee ballot process
and the public’s confidence in the outcome of the electoral process.”

“This offense was done with deceit and intent to defraud and against the
peace and dignity of the state,” said the indictment, which a grand jury
in Wake County returned on
Tuesday.

## New Charges for Republican Operative

L. McCrae Dowless Jr., who was previously indicted for his work in other
elections, was charged in connection with an effort to manipulate
general election results in the Ninth Congressional
District.

Through his lawyer, Mr. Dowless, who worked during the 2018 campaign for
Mark Harris, the Republican nominee in North Carolina’s Ninth
Congressional District, has denied wrongdoing. A woman who answered the
phone at the lawyer’s office on Tuesday afternoon declined to comment.

Mr. Harris, who eventually gave up his bid to be elected to Congress,
has also denied any role in any election fraud.

But state elections regulators and investigators concluded that Mr.
Dowless, who had worked for Democratic and Republican politicians alike
over the years, had overseen [a network of
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/20/us/north-carolina-voter-fraud.html)
who collected absentee ballots — a violation of North Carolina law — and
sometimes completed them while he was a contractor for Mr. Harris’s
campaign.

ballots*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/20/us/north-carolina-voter-fraud.html)
*in North Carolina.\]*

Although officials never proved that Mr. Dowless’s group touched enough
ballots in and around Bladen County to account for the entirety of Mr.
Harris’s 905-vote edge, the State Board of Elections decided in February
to [order a new
vote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/21/us/mark-harris-nc-voter-fraud.html).
At the time, the chairman of the elections board, Robert Cordle, cited
“the corruption, the absolute mess with the absentee ballots” and
described the November election as “tainted.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Voters in the district, which includes part of Charlotte, will pick a
new congressman in September. Mr. Harris is not a candidate, but last
year’s Democratic candidate, Dan McCready, is running for the seat
against Dan Bishop, who became the Republican nominee in May.

Mr. Dowless was [charged in
February](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/27/us/mcrae-dowless-indicted.html)
with a series of felonies connected to the general election in 2016 and
the primary balloting in 2018. In both elections, according to
indictments that were filed in Wake County, Mr. Dowless’s conduct
“served to undermine the integrity of the absentee ballot process and
the public’s confidence in the outcome of the electoral process.”

Until now, though, Mr. Dowless had not been charged in connection with
the 2018 general election. But his prosecution was widely expected as
federal and state investigators spent months gathering evidence.

Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the State Board of
Elections, said in a statement on Tuesday that the misconduct linked to
Mr. Dowless had “effectively disenfranchised voters” in the Ninth
District.

“North Carolina voters should be confident that state officials will
continue to be vigilant and pursue any individuals or organizations that
attempt to undermine our elections,” she said. “Democracy is best served
by holding those who attempt to thwart it accountable.”

In an interview in February, Lorrin Freeman, the Wake County district
attorney, said she and other investigators had been waiting for the
elections board to conclude its work before they turned their focus to
last year’s general election.

“What has been challenging about this case and this investigation is
that, as has been widely reported, certain activity has gone on for
years,” Ms. Freeman, who began investigating Mr. Dowless’s activities in
Bladen County after the local prosecutor recused himself, said in her
suite of offices in Raleigh, the North Carolina capital. “The more
interviews you do, the more interviews you have to do.”

The Ninth District has been without representation since January, when
the term of Representative Robert M. Pittenger expired. Mr. Harris
narrowly defeated Mr. Pittenger in a Republican primary in May 2018.
