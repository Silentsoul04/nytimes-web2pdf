HBO’s “[A Black Lady Sketch
Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPBi9ttKbeU)” invites viewers into
uncharted territory. The series, created by Robin Thede and co-executive
produced by Issa Rae, boasts a rarity for TV: a cast, writers room and
director (Dime Davis) comprised entirely of black women.

Thede, who also stars in the new series, is no stranger to blazing
trails. “For the record, I was the FIRST African-American woman to be
head writer for a late-night show,” [she recently
tweeted](https://twitter.com/robinthede/status/1148700355737161729),
referring to her stint on Comedy Central’s short-lived “The Nightly Show
With Larry Wilmore.” For the “Black Lady Sketch Show” writers room,
Thede tapped such talk-show veterans as her former “Nightly Show”
colleague Holly Walker, Amber Ruffin (“Late Night With Seth Meyers”) and
Lauren Ashley Smith (a writer on Thede’s own brief late-night show, “The
Rundown”).

While the guest list is stacked and star-studded — with appearances by
Angela Bassett, Patti LaBelle, Laverne Cox, David Alan Grier and more —
viewers may be less familiar with the series regulars, who deliver spy
spoofs, beauty mishaps, dating disasters and scenes from an all-black
lady courtroom in the first season. Here’s a quick primer to acquaint
you with your comedy queens-to-be before the show premieres Friday.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Named one of Variety’s “[10 Comics to Watch
for 2019,](https://variety.com/2019/legit/features/10-comics-to-watch-2019-variety-1203242713/)”
she previously hosted BET’s “The Rundown With Robin Thede,” a late-night
news show that allowed her to riff on both pop culture and politics.
(Fun fact: She’s the daughter of Representative Phyllis Thede of Iowa).
The Chris Rock-produced program was canceled in 2018 after one season,
despite receiving critical praise. In addition to her “Nightly Show”
credits, Thede was the head writer on “The Queen Latifah Show” from
2013-2014 and wrote for “The Real Husbands of Hollywood” as well as
several BET awards shows. Of her new sketch show’s title, [Thede
recently
said](https://www.hbo.com/a-black-lady-sketch-show/a-black-lady-sketch-show-essence-fest-coverage)
that the use of the word “A” — rather than “The” — is intentional. “We
want to be one of many. This opens the door for many more to come.”

## Ashley Nicole Black

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A former [correspondent](https://youtu.be/81dhho3JuK4) and part of the
Emmy-winning writing team for “Full Frontal with Samantha Bee,” Black
entered the late-night scene with a Second City background, having
taught comedy writing at the famed Chicago comedy institution. She’s
also held down hosting duties on “[Sip on
This,”](https://www.damemagazine.com/podcasts/siponthis/) an advice
podcast that’s featured such guests as the author Ijeoma Oluo, the
activist Charlotte Clymer and Thede. In the Twitterverse, Black is known
as a risk-taker. After establishing a failed, yet valiant, campaign
earlier this year to become the first lady to the presidential hopeful
Senator Cory Booker (\#PresidentialThirstTrap), Black returned to the
timeline in May seeking dating advice from Senator Elizabeth Warren.
This resulted in the comedian and the senator sharing a heartfelt
telephone exchange and making

## Quinta Brunson

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This dry-witted stand-up comedian first earned viral status with her
2014 Instagram series, [“The Girl Who Has Never Been on a Nice
Date.”](https://youtu.be/op2pK_w8_oY) (Yes, she’s the wide-eyed “He
got money\!” girl.) Since then, Brunson has earned millions of clicks
for her hilariously matter-of-fact skits and GIFs — you’ve likely seen
her patting herself on the back for a silver medal win, Milly Rocking
across the globe or supportively declaring that “People be gay.” The
former BuzzFeed development partner went on to create and star in the
YouTube Red sitcom [“Broke”](https://youtu.be/Ya0QRhZAKJQ) and proved
she’s a maven of minutiae with her Facebook Watch series “[Quinta vs.
Everything.”](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/QuintaVsEverything/)
She’s currently doing voice work on the Adult Swim animated series
“Lazor Wulf.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From 1998-2000, Dennis served as a host of BET’s youth-targeted talk
show “Teen Summit.” She has since made the rounds as a TV actress,
appearing in shows like “Insecure,” Mara Brock Akil’s pro football
sitcom “The Game” and the procedural drama “Rosewood.” More recently,
Dennis played Whitney Houston in the 2018 biopic “The Bobby Brown Story”
and the holistic doctor Tilda Johnson on “Luke Cage.”
