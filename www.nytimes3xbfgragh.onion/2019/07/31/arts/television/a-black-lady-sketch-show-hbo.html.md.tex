HBO's ``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPBi9ttKbeU}{A Black Lady
Sketch Show}'' invites viewers into uncharted territory. The series,
created by Robin Thede and co-executive produced by Issa Rae, boasts a
rarity for TV: a cast, writers room and director (Dime Davis) comprised
entirely of black women.

Thede, who also stars in the new series, is no stranger to blazing
trails. ``For the record, I was the FIRST African-American woman to be
head writer for a late-night show,''
\href{https://twitter.com/robinthede/status/1148700355737161729}{she
recently tweeted}, referring to her stint on Comedy Central's
short-lived ``The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore.'' For the ``Black
Lady Sketch Show'' writers room, Thede tapped such talk-show veterans as
her former ``Nightly Show'' colleague Holly Walker, Amber Ruffin (``Late
Night With Seth Meyers'') and Lauren Ashley Smith (a writer on Thede's
own brief late-night show, ``The Rundown'').

While the guest list is stacked and star-studded --- with appearances by
Angela Bassett, Patti LaBelle, Laverne Cox, David Alan Grier and more
--- viewers may be less familiar with the series regulars, who deliver
spy spoofs, beauty mishaps, dating disasters and scenes from an
all-black lady courtroom in the first season. Here's a quick primer to
acquaint you with your comedy queens-to-be before the show premieres
Friday.

Named one of Variety's
``\href{https://variety.com/2019/legit/features/10-comics-to-watch-2019-variety-1203242713/}{10
Comics to Watch for 2019,}'' she previously hosted BET's ``The Rundown
With Robin Thede,'' a late-night news show that allowed her to riff on
both pop culture and politics. (Fun fact: She's the daughter of
Representative Phyllis Thede of Iowa). The Chris Rock-produced program
was canceled in 2018 after one season, despite receiving critical
praise. In addition to her ``Nightly Show'' credits, Thede was the head
writer on ``The Queen Latifah Show'' from 2013-2014 and wrote for ``The
Real Husbands of Hollywood'' as well as several BET awards shows. Of her
new sketch show's title,
\href{https://www.hbo.com/a-black-lady-sketch-show/a-black-lady-sketch-show-essence-fest-coverage}{Thede
recently said} that the use of the word ``A'' --- rather than ``The''
--- is intentional. ``We want to be one of many. This opens the door for
many more to come.''

\subsection{Ashley Nicole Black}\label{ashley-nicole-black}}

A former \href{https://youtu.be/81dhho3JuK4}{correspondent} and part of
the Emmy-winning writing team for ``Full Frontal with Samantha Bee,''
Black entered the late-night scene with a Second City background, having
taught comedy writing at the famed Chicago comedy institution. She's
also held down hosting duties on
``\href{https://www.damemagazine.com/podcasts/siponthis/}{Sip on
This,''} an advice podcast that's featured such guests as the author
Ijeoma Oluo, the activist Charlotte Clymer and Thede. In the
Twitterverse, Black is known as a risk-taker. After establishing a
failed, yet valiant, campaign earlier this year to become the first lady
to the presidential hopeful Senator Cory Booker
(\#PresidentialThirstTrap), Black returned to the timeline in May
seeking dating advice from Senator Elizabeth Warren. This resulted in
the comedian and the senator sharing a heartfelt telephone exchange and
making

\hypertarget{quinta-brunson}{%
\subsection{Quinta Brunson}\label{quinta-brunson}}

This dry-witted stand-up comedian first earned viral status with her
2014 Instagram series, \href{https://youtu.be/op2pK_w8_oY}{``The Girl
Who Has Never Been on a Nice Date.''} (Yes, she's the wide-eyed ``He got
money!'' girl.) Since then, Brunson has earned millions of clicks for
her hilariously matter-of-fact skits and GIFs --- you've likely seen her
patting herself on the back for a silver medal win, Milly Rocking across
the globe or supportively declaring that ``People be gay.'' The former
BuzzFeed development partner went on to create and star in the YouTube
Red sitcom \href{https://youtu.be/Ya0QRhZAKJQ}{``Broke''} and proved
she's a maven of minutiae with her Facebook Watch series
``\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/QuintaVsEverything/}{Quinta
vs. Everything.''} She's currently doing voice work on the Adult Swim
animated series ``Lazor Wulf.''

\hypertarget{gabrielle-dennis}{%
\subsection{Gabrielle Dennis}\label{gabrielle-dennis}}

From 1998-2000, Dennis served as a host of BET's youth-targeted talk
show ``Teen Summit.'' She has since made the rounds as a TV actress,
appearing in shows like ``Insecure,'' Mara Brock Akil's pro football
sitcom ``The Game'' and the procedural drama ``Rosewood.'' More
recently, Dennis played Whitney Houston in the 2018 biopic ``The Bobby
Brown Story'' and the holistic doctor Tilda Johnson on ``Luke Cage.''
