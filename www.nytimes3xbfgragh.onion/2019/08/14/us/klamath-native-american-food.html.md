*Good morning.*

*(If you don’t get California Today by email,* [*here’s the
sign-up*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/california-today)*.)*

It worked out well that Lisa Hillman was at the tiny airport in
McKinleyville, Humboldt County, when I called her to talk recently. She
usually doesn’t have cell service.

That’s because Ms. Hillman, a member of the [Karuk
Tribe](http://www.karuk.us/) who works as program manager for its Píkyav
Field Institute, lives two hours away in the town of Orleans, along the
Klamath River.

Also a long drive away from her home: The nearest grocery store.

“They just opened up a supermarket in Hoopa, which is 40 minutes away,”
she told me. “But they’re all small and they’re all super expensive.”

The tribes, like the Karuk, who live in the vast, towering forests of
the Klamath River Basin — who have for centuries hunted deer and
gathered acorns, who knew how to weave baskets to catch once-plentiful
salmon — now face food shortages at higher rates than almost anywhere
else in the country.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

*\[Read more about how* [*a sick river and heroin abuse have plagued
communities*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/04/us/klamath-river-california-tribes-heroin.html)
*in the Klamath River Basin.\]*

While 11.8 percent of households nationally experience some level of
food insecurity, [a recent federally funded five-year
study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-019-00925-y)
found that 92 percent of the households in the Klamath Basin suffer from
some kind of food insecurity. Almost 65 percent rely on food assistance,
compared with 12 percent nationally.

But the research, which Ms. Hillman worked on along with academics from
U.C. Berkeley, also found that those community members lacked access to
indigenous foods — and those could better feed those communities today.

Native foods, according to the federal definition, are plants or animals
that are hunted, harvested, gathered, grown or prepared using
traditional Native American methods. Such foods can be wild or
cultivated and they’re specific to locations and distinct cultures.

Ms. Hillman said her grandparents were taught to be ashamed to be Native
American. They were sent to a faraway boarding school.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They did the best they could,” she said. “And they taught their kids
how to survive in white culture.”

Subsequent generations, as a result, haven’t gotten the lifelong
education in the kind of traditional practices they’d need to cultivate
a diet on native foods.

Then there’s the fact that while the tribes once had unfettered access
to millions of acres, over decades, that land has been effectively
closed off to the people who were its first stewards by the federal
government.

*\[Read more about* [*Gov. Gavin Newsom’s apology to the state’s Native
Americans*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/us/newsom-native-american-apology.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)
*and about tribal leaders’ responses.\]*

Climate change and poor forest management have made the lands that are
left less fertile for food sources. As my colleague Jose Del Real
[reported last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/04/us/klamath-river-california-tribes-heroin.html),
salmon runs have declined.

On top of all that, there aren’t as many employment opportunities in
remote areas, so all people can afford, Ms. Hillman said, are unhealthy
commodity foods: white flour, processed sugar and milk in communities
where most people are lactose intolerant.

“It’s absolutely a dead ringer for diabetes and heart disease and
obesity,” Ms. Hillman said.

But Ms. Hillman said she sees promise for [Native American agriculture
in the most recent Farm
Bill](https://civileats.com/2019/07/24/indigenous-food-security-is-dependent-on-food-sovereignty/).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She said that when she sits down to eat with her six kids, they have
vegetables from a garden that Ms. Hillman said is bursting right now,
along with venison and jarred acorns.

the Trump administration from implementing a rule that would deny
permanent residency to immigrants if they were deemed likely to use
government benefits. \[[The New York

— In another battle, California and more than two dozen other states and

restrictions on coal-burning power plants**. The case could have
far-reaching ramifications for how the federal government can fight
