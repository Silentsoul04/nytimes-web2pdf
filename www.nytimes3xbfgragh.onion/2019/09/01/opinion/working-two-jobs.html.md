# One Job Is Better Than Two

</div>

Millions of Americans have full-time jobs that don’t pay enough to make
ends meet. So they have to work a second job, too.

It’s easy for most people to find a job in America on Labor Day 2019.
The unemployment rate is very low; store windows are plastered with help
wanted signs.

But for millions of Americans, one job is not enough.

Bridget Hughes, 29, works a regular day shift at a Burger King in Kansas
City, Mo. Three nights a week, she also works the overnight shift at a
nearby McDonald’s. She makes $10 an hour at Burger King and $9.50 an
hour at McDonald’s and, together with her husband’s job at a gas
station, they manage to feed their three children and to pay the rent.

“When I thought of my future, I thought I was going to be at football
games and soccer practices and cheerleading, when in all actuality I’m
lucky if I’m home for birthdays,” Ms. Hughes said. “And my children,
they think if mommy is at work all the time then we should have the
money. But the reality is that I’m at work all the time and I don’t have
the money.”

More than eight million people — roughly 5 percent of all workers — held
more than one job at a time in July, according to the most recent
federal data. The economy has been growing for more than a decade, but
their lives offer a reminder that not all Americans are thriving.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like Ms. Hughes, most people with multiple jobs worked a full-time job
that just didn’t pay enough. Most workers find second jobs in the same
industry, but a growing number have taken on “gig” work like driving for
Uber.

Daniel Asnake, 49, sleeps in his car after his morning shift as a
baggage handler at Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C. Then
he uses the car to earn as much as $145 a shift as an Uber driver well
into the evening. Most days, he leaves home before his two children rise
and returns after they have gone to sleep.

Ashley Cocchiara, 30, hopes to drop her second job soon. Ms. Cocchiara,
who lives south of Pittsburgh, landed a spot in a union training program
for industrial painters two years ago, and as she racks up hours, her
hourly pay is climbing. For now, she still picks up weekend shifts as a
bartender in her hometown, to make enough money to care for her
3-year-old son. By next year, she hopes painting will pay enough so she
can spend the time with her son
instead.

Daniel Asnake, 49, handles baggage at Reagan National Airport, left,
outside Washington, D.C., even though a doctor told him not to lift more
than 15 pounds because of a spinal injury. After finishing his shift at
12:30 p.m., he takes a nap in his car before driving Uber passengers
into the evening, recently ending a shift in Silver Spring, Md., right.
The two jobs allow him to support his wife, Hannah Firdawoke, who is
disabled, and their two sons, Luel Daniel, 7, and Natnel Daniel, 4,
center. But he often goes a week without seeing the
boys.
