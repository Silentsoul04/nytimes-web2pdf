IN 1906, THE YOKOHAMA-BORN scholar Okakura Kakuzo published “[The Book
of
Tea](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/308458/the-book-of-tea-by-kakuzo-okakura/9780141191843/),”
a brief tract for Western readers on *chanoyu*, the centuries-old,
highly ritualized Japanese tea ceremony. He argued that the
aestheticization of the humble act of drinking tea — “the adoration of
the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence” — must be
understood as an ethos underlying an entire culture, from its arts and
literature to the “delicate dishes” of its cuisine. His intent was to
demystify, but his words had almost the opposite effect, heightening the
sense of opacity surrounding both the Japanese approach to food and the
island nation itself, which from the early 17th century until 1853 was
almost completely closed off from the rest of the world.

More than 50 years after Kakuzo’s treatise, the French literary theorist
Roland Barthes, in his 1970 monograph “[Empire of
Signs](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374522070),” described
Japanese cooking in even more esoteric terms, arguing that it privileged
the infinitesimal over Western abundance and was practiced “in a
profound space which hierarchizes man, table and universe.” Today,
Westerners remain in thrall to this vision of *washoku*, traditional
Japanese cuisine, as forbiddingly precise, each ingredient presented
sparely and simply within the narrow window of ripeness in which it has
fulfilled its destiny, to reflect the ephemerality of life. (Never mind
that this philosophy has only ever applied to *kaiseki*, the most
rarefied level of Japanese dining.)

*\[*[*Sign up

*for the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors
are noticing and coveting now.\]*

So it’s slightly disconcerting to find a bag of Safeway-brand jalapeño
Cheddar cheese bagels — surely not representative of the beautiful in
any culture — in the kitchen at [Hannyatou](https://www.hannyatou.com/),
a tiny sake bar in
[Seattle](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/05/travel/what-to-do-in-seattle.html)
helmed by the chef Mutsuko Soma. Lumpy and craggy, the bagels are
treated as a serious ingredient: pulverized, then calibrated with salt
and koji (grains or legumes inoculated with spores of Aspergillus
oryzae, phylogenetically kin to the mold that turns coagulated milk into
blue cheese) and left to turn funky and fetid over weeks. Soma grew up
north of Tokyo and came to the United States at the age of 18. She is
one of several chefs outside Japan — expatriates, immigrants and nisei
and sansei (second- and third-generation descendants of immigrants), as
well as gaijin (foreigners), drawn, often circuitously, to the cuisine —
who have opened restaurants in the past few years that are pushing
Japanese food in unexpected, even counterintuitive directions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Purists might dispute the idiosyncratic unfolding of kaiseki at the
haute [Odo](https://www.odo.nyc/), half-hidden like a speakeasy at the
back of a cocktail bar in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, where
Hiroki Odo has been known to forsake tempura in the *agemono* (fried)
course in favor of a French croquette heavy with béchamel. There will be
quibbles over the dashi deployed at the Los Angeles breakfast and lunch
spot [Konbi](https://konbila.com/), since the chefs, [Akira Akuto and
Nick
Montgomery](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/28/dining/konbi-egg-salad-sandwich-instagram.html),
leave the bonito shavings to steep and simmer longer than usual,
privileging deep, brooding flavor over clarity. And downright
bewilderment might greet the melting of Swiss cocoa powder into curry at
[Tatsu
Aikawa](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/30/dining/austin-texas-japanese-restaurants.html)’s
cheekily named [Domo Alley-Gato](https://domo-tatsuya.com/) bar in
Austin, Tex.

Yet however maverick or heretical on the surface, the work of these
chefs is rooted in Japanese technique. Soma treats those jalapeño
Cheddar cheese bagels as if they were soybeans en route to miso, and the
paste they become achieves the same desirable tang of salty-sweet
underground rot. Nor is there anything radical about these chefs’
attention to seasonality and place, tenets at the heart of washoku. It
just so happens that the place in question is not Japan but Paris, in
the 11th Arrondissement, where the American chefs Robert Compagnon and
Jessica Yang of [Le Rigmarole](https://www.lerigmarole.com/) have
adopted Japanese yakitori as, Compagnon says, “a framing mechanism for
whatever is in season” — tiny charred tomatoes with puckering skins,
leeks daubed with cod-roe mayonnaise — and made variants on the
sour-spicy condiment yuzu kosho out of French citrus fruits as they come
in and out of harvest. In Brooklyn, [Patch
Troffer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/31/magazine/how-to-cook-all-the-mushrooms.html),
an American chef of Japanese descent who last year took over the kitchen
at the farm-to-table institution [Marlow &
Sons](http://marlowandsons.com/), supplants wasabi with horseradish root
grown in upstate New York. “It’s the food of the displaced and the
diaspora,” Troffer says. “What happens when you don’t have the right
ingredients” — a lesson he learned from his Japanese grandmother, who
married a marine during the Korean War and wound up in South Carolina,
making dashi out of canned clams and writing to
[Katagiri](http://katagiri.com/) grocery in New York to beg for
shipments of soy sauce and umeboshi.

Odo, a native of
[Kyushu](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/09/t-magazine/travel/new-japan-hotels.html),
has had to adjust to the tastes and textures of American ingredients, as
well as the bias of the American palate toward more flagrant flavors.
The almost ascetic simplicity of classical kaiseki can be a cultural
barrier; diners here “might feel like they’re eating nothing,” he says.
(His American-born sous chef, Brian Saito, translated for us.) Foraged
vegetables from Pennsylvania and upstate New York are delivered to the
restaurant once a week. On a recent afternoon in April, they included
ramps, whose garlicky punch would be considered too strong for dishes
intended to accompany the tea ceremony in Kyoto, where Odo apprenticed
in the cuisine. But “this is New York kaiseki,” he says, so he commits
to richness and pairs the ramps with wild Alaskan king salmon, an oily
fish that is marinated in bourbon — instead of sake — chosen partly for
aroma and partly for provenance: It’s made nearby at Brooklyn’s [Kings
County Distillery](http://kingscountydistillery.com/).

For Aikawa, who at the age of 10 was whisked by his mother from Tokyo to
a rural Texan commune, food tells the story of immigration and the
meeting of cultures. “When I go to a barbecue, I bring a tub of rice,”
he says. At [Kemuri Tatsu-ya](http://kemuri-tatsuya.com/), the
half-izakaya, half-barbecue spot he and the chef Takuya Matsumoto opened
in 2017, he categorizes brisket as lean or *toro*, borrowing from sushi
vocabulary the designation of fatty tuna. “I want to treat brisket like
sashimi — put it on a pedestal,” he says. His take on Texas barbecue is
straightforward (“out of respect”), but there’s a touch of miso in the
sauce, and he anoints yakitori skewers of chicken skin with garlic salt
and lime to honor his Mexican neighbors.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Within this cohort, several chefs revel in the juxtaposition of Japanese
and Italian cuisine — the latter long beloved in Japan, where it is
fondly called *itameshi*, and where local chefs obsess over perfecting
Neapolitan pizza with kerchief-thin, pliant crusts and cooking spaghetti
to the exact second of al dente. Amid the parade of yakitori at Le
Rigmarole, Compagnon and Yang present pasta that shows a clear debt to
Italy while resembling no codified recipe; even their noodle shapes and
names — cushioni, for ravioli that look like doll pillows; faniciulle,
from the Italian word for maidens, elaborately folded like demure hoods
— are the chefs’ inventions. At
[Blackship](https://www.blackshipla.com/) in West Hollywood, which
opened last December, the New York-raised Keiichi Kurobe presses shiso
leaves into housemade noodles and garnishes dishes with them in lieu of
basil. And a few miles away, in the Palms neighborhood, the best-known
dish at [Niki
Nakayama](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/16/t-magazine/food/female-chefs-rita-sodi-jody-williams-erika-nakamura.html)’s
[n/naka](https://n-naka.com/) is the pasta that materializes in the
middle of her otherwise recognizably Japanese kaiseki: Derived from a
genre of food called
[*yoshoku*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/03/26/dining/26japan.html)
— dishes borrowed from the West and freely altered with local
ingredients to satisfy Japanese tastes — her spaghetti is glossed with
mentaiko (pickled cod roe), as it might appear in Japan, then strewn
with petals of razor-cut abalone and black truffles.

THESE DISHES CONFOUND Western notions of what Japanese food should be,
in part because diners who haven’t grown up eating the cuisine often
encounter it in the limited binary framework of high and low: austere
sushi bars where the tab starts at three figures versus [quick-turnover
ramen
shops](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/01/31/travel/31ramen.html),
with few options in between. In adopting ingredients and techniques from
other cultures, the new movement might even uncomfortably recall the
Asian-fusion trend that started in the late ’80s, which was spearheaded
by chefs of European descent. But where those chefs filtered Japanese
cuisine through a Western perspective, taking Japanese elements out of
context and subsuming and bending them to their will, today’s chefs are
doing the opposite — viewing the West and its culinary traditions
through a Japanese lens. As the thinking on diversity in America has
evolved from the metaphor of a melting pot to a mosaic, in which each
piece keeps its integrity while enriching the whole, the concept of
fusion has become archaic, replaced by a more organic understanding of
how food changes when people immigrate and have to adapt to the
ingredients on hand.

By refuting rigid orthodoxy — and some inchoate standard of authenticity
— these chefs remind us that Japanese cuisine is not some repository of
edicts past but a lived and living tradition, as well as a pastiche, one
that has borrowed unapologetically from other cultures throughout
history, despite the country’s long seclusion. Tempura, both dish and
word, was a gift from the Portuguese, whose language was brought
accidentally to Japan when, in 1543, three Portuguese sailors on a
Chinese ship made contact in southern Japan. Jesuit missionaries
followed, ultimately passing on a recipe for peixinhos da horta (“little
fish of the garden”): green beans dusted in flour and deep-fried.

Curry arrived in the 19th century, during the Meiji era, from India via
the British Royal Navy, when the subcontinent was part of the Raj. It
was considered a Western dish and thus pricey, until the late 1950s,
when Japanese companies started selling instant curry that produced a
dish milder and sweeter than either its British or Indian counterpart.
Troffer modeled his curry after the best-selling S\&B brand but with a
lashing of heat; during the colder months, it’s served at Marlow as it
often appears in Japan, with pork katsu, a cutlet gilded in panko.
Aikawa took his Texas version further afield, finding kinship to
Louisiana gumbo and Mexican mole as he wrangled more than two dozen
spices trying to strike the right balance, recalibrating by the gram in
batch after batch. He serves his curry straight or amped up into a near
chili, which is stuffed in a brioche bun and topped by a hot dog that’s
been patted down with panko and deep-fried so it suggests a hard-shell
taco.

## The concept of fusion has become archaic, replaced by a more organic understanding of how food changes when people immigrate.

Ramen, likewise, has no time-honored history. According to [George
Solt](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/04/30/dining/an-indie-spirits-shop-a-history-book-on-ramen-real-baby-carrots-and-more.html)’s
“[The Untold History of
Ramen](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520282353/the-untold-history-of-ramen)”
(2014), the dish is said to have first appeared in 1910 in Tokyo, under
the name shina soba (Chinese noodles); almost vanished during World War
II, when flour was strictly rationed and street vendors were banned; and
revived with imports of wheat under the midcentury U.S. occupation —
when Americans hoped to keep the population sated and therefore
invulnerable to the promises of communism — to eventually flourish
postwar as a hearty and cheap lunch. Of all Japanese foods, it might be
“the most open, the most receptive to change and experimentation,” the
American-born chef [Ivan
Orkin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/12/18/dining/a-life-of-noodles-comes-full-circle.html)
wrote (with Chris Ying) in the 2013 cookbook “[Ivan
Ramen](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/222246/ivan-ramen-by-ivan-orkin-with-chris-ying-foreword-by-david-chang/9781607744467/).”

Japanese chefs must typically apprentice for years before they get the
opportunity to run their own kitchens, but Shigetoshi Nakamura won fame
for his ramen shop in Tokyo while still in his 20s. Earlier this decade,
he opened an [eponymous shop](http://www.nakamuranyc.com/) on the Lower
East Side of Manhattan, and this year he converted the storefront next
door to [Niche](http://www.nakamuranyc.com/niche), focusing on mazemen,
a version of ramen that largely dispenses with broth. In homage to the
neighborhood’s historic Jewish delis, Nakamura cold-smokes salmon
in-house and drapes it over noodles in a loose sauce of cod roe and
olive oil.

Even the California roll, often held up as an example of sacrilege, is
believed to have been invented by a Japanese immigrant chef in the late
1960s, who, finding himself in Los Angeles without a reliable supply of
bluefin tuna, swapped in an ingredient more plentiful on the West Coast,
one with its own richness and heft: avocado.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

AS THE CONTOURS and definitions of Japanese food have expanded, many
chefs who are not of Japanese descent have also devoted themselves to
this contemporary, freewheeling style, further collapsing and
questioning the boundaries between the East and the West. Compagnon and
Yang see their Paris restaurant as an ideal compact between cultures
equally obsessed with mastery; as Compagnon says with a laugh, “France
and Japan are the only two culinary cultures that respect each other
while looking down on everyone else.” (Some of today’s most lauded
French restaurants in Paris — including [Les Enfants
Rouge](https://www.les-enfants-rouges.fr/), [Clown
Bar](http://www.clown-bar-paris.com/) and
[Abri](https://www.lafourchette.com/restaurant/abri/308115?cc=18174-54f)
— are run by chefs from Japan, whose compatriots back in their native
country are equally scrupulous in their devotion to French cuisine.)
Compagnon came to Japanese food by first studying Japanese language and
literature, as did Orkin, who grew up on New York’s Long Island and
lived in Tokyo for years. These chefs are quick to acknowledge their
status as gaijin and students, not masters, of the dishes they’ve come
to love. Orkin and Ying’s forthcoming book’s title, “[The Gaijin
Cookbook: Japanese Recipes from a Chef, Father, Eater, and Lifelong
Outsider](https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/The-Gaijin-Cookbook/9781328954350),”
addresses it directly, while Compagnon and Yang demur from calling Le
Rigmarole a Japanese restaurant, speaking instead of a prevailing
aesthetic and attention to
technique.

## ‘I’m being very clear to myself that I’m not doing Japanese food,’ says chef Patch Troffer. ‘I want to explore what it is to be Japanese-American.’

For Troffer — whose half-Japanese mother didn’t cook Japanese food often
but always had nori and a pot of rice at the ready — there is no
distance between East and West. “I’m being very clear to myself that I’m
not doing Japanese food,” he says. “I want to explore what it is to be
Japanese-American.” The results reflect an attunement to the full range
of possibility latent in each ingredient: He layers and deepens flavors
by using dashi instead of water, “finding every little moment where an
ingredient can slip its way in and add something,” he says.
Nevertheless, his grandmother was skeptical when he showed her a
photograph of his
[okonomiyaki](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020172-classic-okonomiyaki-japanese-cabbage-and-pork-pancakes),
which he calls a sour cabbage pancake on his menu in homage to how she
used to make it, with little more than shredded cabbage, soy sauce and
flour. A fried egg is laid over it, in a flop. “She gave me the most
disapproving eyebrow,” he says.

Yet in Japan, this would hardly be heretical. Freedom is built into the
very name of the dish; broken down into *okonomi* and *yaki*, it means
whatever you want, thrown on the grill. And although the okonomiyaki
most commonly found throughout Japan originated in Osaka, there are a
number of regional variations, including the Hiroshima style, in which
the dish is built one strata at a time: first batter, followed by
cabbage, bean sprouts, pork and noodles and, finally, yes, a fried egg,
with the rest of the pancake shoveled over it and then flipped so the
egg lands on top.

Sometimes Japanese visitors to Odo’s restaurant in Manhattan tell him
that they miss the milder flavors of traditional kaiseki. But the chef
remains firm in his mission. The strict etiquette and radical simplicity
of the formal meal are “not very welcoming to Americans,” he says, which
contradicts the Japanese principle of omotenashi, an elevated form of
hospitality in which the guest’s happiness is the focus of all action
and thought. Even in Japan, kaiseki can intimidate diners, particularly
of the younger generation. To ameliorate this, Zaiyu Hasegawa, the chef
of [Den](https://www.jimbochoden.com/en/), a modern kaiseki spot that
opened in 2008 in Tokyo, begins each meal with monaka, an everyday
Japanese treat of adzuki bean paste smeared between mochi wafers. While
his filling is elevated, studded with foie gras and persimmon, its
appearance is not: The dish arrives at the table as the kind of sandwich
cookie sold at convenience stores, complete with a paper wrapper. Later
comes a salad with carrots cut into the emoji with hearts for eyes and a
box evoking Kentucky Fried Chicken that contains wings shucked of bone
and stuffed with sticky rice, nestled on a bed of straw.

The food is thrillingly irreverent, so at first you don’t notice how
fastidious it is, how close to perfection. You laugh, and then you fall
silent, the quick visual delight giving way to depths of flavor and
something more elusive — a consciousness of food as past and present, at
once memory and daily recurrence. The old ways meet the new — not in
combat but in continuance.
