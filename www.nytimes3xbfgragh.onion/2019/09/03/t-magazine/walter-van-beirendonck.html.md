THE COLLECTION WAS called Wonder and was shown in Paris’s Bataclan
theater, in the 11th Arrondissement, in late June of 2009. Large,
hirsute men — bears, in the lexicon of gay male culture — stomped down
the runway. A dizzying tempo of electronic music blared on the speakers.
The bears had a variety of facial hair and wore a variety of looks: wide
cotton cargo pants with zip pockets in the shape of dildos and clouds
paired with electric blue and pink blazers fashioned from a lightweight
cloqué material; acid pink and neon green PVC ponchos over sneakers with
knee-high white socks scrawled with words like “bear” and “pleasure.” It
was seemingly the end when the designer, Walter Van Beirendonck —
himself a large, hirsute Belgian man, a chicer version of Santa Claus —
emerged to do his own walk down the runway. As a finale, the bears
assembled onstage, only to be upstaged by another group of bears, this
one wearing white briefs, with a “W” sewn in red across the crotch, who
arrived to stand defiantly in front of them, claiming the runway as
their own. The crowd clapped. The show was over.

[Van Beirendonck](http://www.waltervanbeirendonck.com/), who is 62, has
been designing improbable, idiosyncratic men’s fashion for over four
decades. He is one of the so-called [Antwerp
Six](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/06/18/fashion/a-rare-reunion-for-the-antwerp-six.html),
a group of Belgian designers who in the mid-80s helped transform the
city, only Belgium’s second largest, into an unlikely fashion center. He
is also the director of the fashion school at Antwerp’s well-regarded
[Royal Academy of Fine
Arts](https://www.ap.be/en/royal-academy-fine-arts-antwerp), from which
he graduated, and is considered a mentor by many designers, including
[Craig
Green](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/09/t-magazine/craig-green-mens-fashion-week.html),
[Bernhard
Willhelm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/29/t-magazine/a-paris-designer-sets-up-a-creative-commune-in-the-hollywood-hills.html)
and Kris Van Assche, the [creative director of
Berluti](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/03/fashion/berluti-kris-van-assche-lvmh.html).
He’s a contemporary and collaborator of artists as diverse as the
Japanese founder of [Comme des
Garçons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/03/t-magazine/rei-kawakubo-comme-des-garcons-menswear.html),
[Rei
Kawakubo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/rei-kawakubo);
the Austrian conceptual artist [Erwin
Wurm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/03/09/t-magazine/erwin-wurm-shape-shifter.html);
the French artist
[Orlan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1993/11/21/style/a-portrait-in-skin-and-bone.html);
the Irish rock band
[U2](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/u2); and the
Australian industrial designer [Marc
Newson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/03/14/t-magazine/02well-newsonhouse.html).
He is often credited with pioneering a new aesthetic: When he started
his career in 1982, at the age of 25, European men’s wear was generally
limited to suiting and separates cut in traditional tweeds, wools and
cottons. Van Beirendonck was one of the lone disrupters of this code of
masculinity and formality, melding technically futuristic fabrics —
often those used exclusively in sportswear — with the couture-like
craftsmanship he learned at the Royal Academy, while overlaying a
uniquely sunny, humorous, almost childlike filter on his anarchistic
silhouettes, which were otherwise informed by darker allusions to
B.D.S.M. and punk rock culture.

He is also, in an age in which fashion has become a multibillion-dollar
business — less a forum for artistic expression than one for potentially
enormous profits — defiant in not only his singular sensibility but in
his apparent lack of interest in the commercial and the compromised.
These days, the runway is, with increasing frequency, a place for
political provocations, for expressions of gender fluidity, kink and
queerness. But this is a recent development, and one that arguably finds
its roots in Van Beirendonck’s shows. He is the last punk, one whose
work can today feel predictive in its obsessions and transgressions, and
to which contemporary fashion owes a debt. “It was easy for me to do
what I do when I started in the early 2000s,” says the American fashion
designer [Thom
Browne](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/thom-browne),
known for his own upending of traditional men’s wear codes. “In the
early ’80s, it was brave, what Walter was doing. You have to cite real
revolutionaries like him for leading the way. He’s inspiring to all of
us who are designing
now.”

“WHAT WOULD YOU like to know about me?” Van Beirendonck asks. It is
evening in the village of Zandhoven, a 30-minute drive east of Antwerp,
where Van Beirendonck lives in a large 19th-century house, which sits on
an expansive property covered by wild grass and old trees. He is about
to travel to Tokyo to collaborate with Kawakubo on a new T-shirt.

Van Beirendonck was born in 1957 and grew up in the same small village
where he lives today. His parents owned an auto-repair garage and gas
station, and Van Beirendonck was mostly raised by his grandmother and
his oldest sister. At 12, he was sent to boarding school in Lier,
southeast of Antwerp, where he kept to himself, sketching and writing in
his diary. He knew he was gay at 14, and came out to his family without
much of an issue. It was the early ’70s then, and [David
Bowie](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/david-bowie) had
created (with the help of the Japanese designer [Kansai
Yamamoto](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/24/t-magazine/fashion/kansai-yamamoto-revival.html))
his [Ziggy
Stardust](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/slideshow/2016/01/11/t-magazine/david-bowie-style/s/11tmag-bowie-slide-77O9.html)
persona, with his plume of red hair, graphic makeup and narrow,
androgynous jumpsuits. For teenagers like Van Beirendonck, who “couldn’t
play football” and were living in polite, bourgeois villages, Bowie and
his compatriots — [Iggy
Pop](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/03/t-magazine/iggy-pop-life-class-nude-drawing-brooklyn-museum.html),
with his snakelike torso and skintight pants; Lou Reed, with his wild
hair and kohl-lined eyes — were a revelation: Here was another way of
being, another way of living. At 18, he picked up a Dutch magazine
called Avenue, which described the fashion department at the Royal
Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp; he enrolled the next year, in 1976.
Founded in 1663, the academy was known for its classical pedagogy,
emphasizing art over commercialism — its fashion department, created in
1963, was a relatively new addition.

At the Royal Academy, Van Beirendonck discovered the rigors and ambition
of design, as well as a coterie of like-minded friends. In his class was
the prodigious [Martin
Margiela](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/08/t-magazine/fashion/martin-margiela-history-fall-winter-2000-show.html),
who a decade later would be working in Paris for the designer [Jean Paul
Gaultier](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/jean-paul-gaultier)
while launching his namesake line. A year later, [Dries Van
Noten](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/16/t-magazine/dries-van-noten.html),
Ann Demeulemeester, Dirk Van Saene, Dirk Bikkembergs and Marina Yee
would join the class below him. Antwerp only had a population of around
half a million in the 1970s, but a particularly outré avant-garde
movement had blossomed around the art gallery Wide White Space, which
represented conceptual artists such as [Joseph
Beuys](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1986/01/25/obituaries/joseph-beuys-sculptor-is-dead-at-64.html)
and [Marcel
Broodthaers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/15/t-magazine/most-important-contemporary-art.html).
There was also a burgeoning experimental theater scene led by the young
director [Ivo van
Hove](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/20/t-magazine/rufus-wainwright-ivo-van-hove-conversation.html).
Like its European neighbors to the east and north, stolid Belgium — with
its
[Magritte](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/rene-magritte)-gray
skies and cobblestone streets — was rapidly transforming. Different in
their aesthetic leanings but similar in their drive, Van Beirendonck and
his schoolmates formed a clique. Van Beirendonck says, “When Ann did
something, then Dries wanted to do it better, and then I wanted to do it
better.” The emergence of new designers such as [Giorgio
Armani](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/19/t-magazine/giorgio-armani-home-broni-italy.html),
[Gianni
Versace](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1997/07/16/style/gianni-versace-50-the-designer-who-infused-fashion-with-life-and-art.html),
[Thierry
Mugler](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/01/t-magazine/thierry-mugler-1995-show.html)
and Claude Montana — who piled big shoulders on ultrasexy feminine
silhouettes and alluded to contemporary culture — was inspiring, too.
They were proof that one didn’t need to build a couture house to make
fashion that people wanted to wear.

Though Belgium may have been waking from its slumber, Van Beirendonck’s
real lodestar was across the sea. From the ’70s through the mid-80s,
London was the primary seat of dissident and anti-establishment design,
not just in fashion but across disciplines: Britain was in the midst of
protracted financial recessions, the Conservative prime minister
[Margaret
Thatcher](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/margaret-thatcher)
had been elected, the performance artist [Leigh
Bowery](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1995/01/07/obituaries/leigh-bowery-33-artist-and-model.html)
had opened his underground nightclub Taboo, which fueled the polysexual
and New Romantic scenes, and all of young artistic life was in revolt.
What they made thrilled a generation of young designers, who saw in
their abandonment of old mores a chance for reinvention. “Walter was
really focused on London,” recalls Van Noten, who was also enthralled by
the city’s raw energy, riotous night life and anti-establishment punk
rock bands and fashion trends. “He was a big fan of I-D and [The
Face](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/26/style/the-face-magazine.html)
and these types of magazines, and of punk clothes made by [Katharine
Hamnett](https://katharinehamnett.com/) and [Vivienne
Westwood](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/vivienne-westwood),
and of Adam and the Ants; he was following that scene very closely, so
when there was a concert or anything like that, we all went together,
completely dressed up. Ann Demeulemeester was more on the darker side. …
I had more of a traditional upbringing, so for me, it was quality
fabrics, couture silks. Everybody brought a different element in the
group and everybody learned from everybody.” The friends traveled to
London and Paris, sneaking into fashion shows on forged invitations.

Upon graduating in 1980, Van Beirendonck began styling and designing for
the Belgian raincoat company Barston. His classmates took on commercial
jobs as well. But they were still putting everything they earned back
into their own collections; Van Beirendonck debuted his first, Sado, in
1982 (he titles all of his collections). “We really were desperate to be
in foreign magazines and be picked up by press, and that’s why we had to
leave Belgium. We did things, but nobody was talking about them outside
of Belgium,” Van Beirendonck says. In 1986, the group — Van Beirendonck,
Van Noten, Van Saene, Bikkembergs and Yee (Demeulemeester, nine months
pregnant, stayed home) — traveled to London with Geert Bruloot, who ran
a boutique in Antwerp. Bruloot showcased their designs as a collective
at a London fashion fair; it drew interest from buyers in New York and
Paris. The group was nicknamed the Antwerp (or Belgian) Six to avoid the
difficulty of pronouncing their Flemish
names.

Suddenly, it seemed as though the center of the fashion world was, if
not moving away, then expanding beyond Paris and London — New York,
Milan, Tokyo and even Antwerp were offering new models for how to be a
designer, for new clothes. Kawakubo showed her collection for the first
time in Paris in 1981 and was shocking people with her colorless,
strange and experimental designs. [Yohji
Yamamoto](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/yohji-yamamoto)
would show a year later. Fashion was shifting from traditionally
feminine and masculine shapes and silhouettes toward something new and
undefined.

For a young designer, then, there was suddenly space — both
existentially and physically — to take risks. It was both the
recklessness and, paradoxically, repressiveness of those years that made
Van Beirendonck’s generation *want* to act out, made them *want* to
choose ecstasy over safety. Who knew what tomorrow would bring? There
was also, incidentally, real financial support by way of a program
launched in the early ’80s by Belgium’s minister of economics, who was
hoping to find a way to reinvigorate the country’s once-thriving linen
industry. A campaign called Fashion: It’s Belgian was established, along
with a competition called the Golden Spindle, both with the goal of
promoting Belgian fashion designers. Unsurprisingly, nearly all of the
Antwerp Six won the Golden Spindle within the first decade of its
creation.

This was also the period in which Van Beirendonck fell in love. He and
Van Saene, a designer and artist, had become romantically involved at
school, and, as Van Beirendonck says, “we never split up again.” They
married last year, and Van Saene now works in a studio next to Van
Beirendonck’s. Together they have formed one of those rare artistic
partnerships in which they are each present to witness the other. “He
knows my strengths and my weaknesses,” Van Beirendonck says. “He is the
one I can talk with about my ideas, and he reacts in a very open and
very clear
way.”

BUT IF THE ’80s was a time of rebellion, it was, in part, a rebellion
against death, brought on by AIDS. “It was a tough and severe period,”
Van Beirendonck tells me, “when several people around me got sick and
died. So did so many of the artists and creative people who we looked up
to.” And yet, even at the height of fear, even when there was little
hope of a cure, even when the shame and metaphor of the virus had become
intertwined with gay culture, Van Beirendonck remained joyful about sex.
His work from those years, such as 1995’s fall collection, Paradise
Pleasure Productions, recognizes and celebrates various subcultures and
codes of gay sex: There are latex suits dripping with flaccid phalluses
and bondage masks made to look like cheap blowup dolls. They have been
leitmotifs ever since — the fall 2012 collection, Lust Never Sleeps,
featured more bondage masks, made from a tan leather and tweed,
evocative of a British dandy — half respectable, half subversive.

The frankness of these collections makes them mesmerizing now, but when
they were first shown, when many governments were actively trying to
stigmatize gay sex, drawing a line between it and the disease, they
would have been shocking. Their bravery is in their lack of apology. And
yet Van Beirendonck doesn’t consider himself a provocateur; his
intention has never been to shock, only to present. And he persists: The
fall 2018 collection, Worlds of Sun and Moon, had pink, yellow and black
ponchos, silk bomber jackets and jumpsuits, all punctuated with glory
holes. “I know that certain things I am doing could be shocking for
certain people,” he said in a 2011 [interview with
ShowStudio](https://www.showstudio.com/projects/in_fashion/walter-van-beirendonck).
“But they are definitely not for me.”

This dedication to depict, unflinchingly, a certain subculture and to
explore the toll AIDS had taken on his community reached its apotheosis
in his 1996 spring collection, Killer / Astral Travel / 4D-Hi-D. Held in
the Lido nightclub in Paris, the show presented an intergalactic world
filled with neon-colored clothes, moon boots and enormous space-age
topiary-like wigs, along with a narrative about a young girl named Heidi
who befriends a space goat. The show’s Heidi character was a direct
reference to the work of the American artists [Mike
Kelley](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/08/t-magazine/art/mike-kelley-mobile-homestead.html)
and [Paul
McCarthy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/paul-mccarthy),
both of whom Van Beirendonck cites as major influences in confronting
the violence and oppression of childhood (Kelley’s work was more abject,
even plaintive; McCarthy’s remains more aggressive and sexually
threatening). In 1992, the two collaborated on a video work called
“[Heidi](https://www.eai.org/titles/heidi),” inspired by the Swiss
writer Johanna Spyri’s 1881 novel about an orphan sent to live in the
woods with her grandfather. Kelley and McCarthy were attracted to the
allegory of Heidi’s story: an innocent girl living with an old man she
wants to please. But in Van Beirendonck’s interpretation, projected onto
a screen at the show, Heidi’s sweet little mountain goat is
transmogrified into a devil, who represents AIDS. He called their
encounter a fatal attraction: the story of something that looks benign
suddenly transforming into something
deadly.

IN 1992, VAN BEIRENDONCK began working with Mustang, a German denim
brand. He was given big budgets to mount elaborate shows under the label
[W.&
L.T.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1995/10/03/style/IHT-belgian-designers-walk-on-the-urban-wild-side.html)
(an acronym for “Wild & Lethal Trash”) —[huge, theatrical
productions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1998/02/08/style/out-there-a-provocateur-of-the-paris-runways.html)
— that attracted an enormous amount of attention and press. But the ’90s
also heralded the arrival of minimalism, and Van Beirendonck didn’t —
and couldn’t — conform to its restrained, colorless aesthetic and cool
affectlessness. He parted ways with Mustang in 1999, and he has remained
independent ever since, free from the confines of a co-ownership with a
fashion conglomerate like LVMH or Kering. This independence explains in
large part why Van Beirendonck is lesser known than his peers and even
some of his students.

Another factor is his dedication to Antwerp, which he has never truly
left. Van Beirendonck joined the faculty at the Royal Academy in 1985
and took over the fashion department in 2007. (Van Saene joined the
faculty in 2009.) The Antwerp Six’s legacy is everywhere; the school now
has an international student body, and its graduates helm some of the
most influential European fashion houses ([Veronique
Branquinho](https://www.veroniquebranquinho.com/) and
[Balenciaga](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/06/14/t-magazine/fashion/balenciaga-how-to-wear.html)’s
[Demna
Gvasalia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/11/t-magazine/gucci-alessandro-michele-balenciaga-vetements-demna-gvasalia.html)
are both alumni). Van Beirendonck has a reputation as a purist, for
treating his students’ collections as works of art — and for trying to
protect them from the industry’s obsession with profits. Last year,
though, a student’s suicide raised questions about the academy’s rigor
and isolationist tendencies. “The suicide of our student was an
incredibly sad incident,” Van Beirendonck says. “We care a lot about our
students and we work with them all the time — we know them rather
personally and form a strong bond. Since it happened, we’ve rethought
certain exercises and tasks to lower the
pressure.”

But if Van Beirendonck’s work can be challenging to actually find — he
sells to around 45 buyers worldwide, including the online retailer
Farfetch, which recently reissued designs from his 2,000-piece archive —
his admirers, though small in number, are devout. The New York-based
artist [Nayland Blake](http://www.naylandblake.net/) is one such
customer, who says that as a 300-pound, six-foot-two self-described
bear, wearing a Van Beirendonck poncho decorated with evil eyes and butt
plugs is a “monstrously joyful” experience. “So much of our life is
spent in pursuit of a kind of conformity,” he says, “and to be willing
to put on a show for each other is, to me, a really exciting prospect.”

Monstrous joy may not have been what Van Beirendonck had in mind when he
began his line. He has increasingly begun emphasizing his considerable
skill as a technical designer, forcing a consideration of the
couture-level skeleton that has always lurked beneath his clothing’s
brash exterior: the fine tailoring, the intricate beading, the
manipulation of traditionally fine fabrics like brocade, Harris tweed
and organza. He claims that he’s never been especially adventurous in
love or life. But he has also never minded being adopted by the club
kids, the ravers, the fetishists and the freaks — all the people who
occupy the fringes, who want to look different because looking different
makes them finally feel seen. Van Beirendonck’s creations can make him
seem like a more glamorous, outsize, wilder person than he really is,
but his fashion never denies who he is, which is what fashion ultimately
does to so many. It denies our bodies, it denies our hunger, it denies
our weird and varied beauty. Van Beirendonck may be one of very few
designers left who is radically true to himself. “In the beginning, when
I worked on my collections, it allowed me to escape from all this
darkness, and I was also trying to give some brightness to the world,”
he says. “That’s exactly what we have now, a dark world, and we want to
at least have some hope.”
