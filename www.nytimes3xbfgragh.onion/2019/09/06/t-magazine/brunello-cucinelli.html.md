# Brunello Cucinelli, Renaissance Man

The designer, best known for what he calls “sportivo chic,” has
maintained roots in his native Italy, improving and restoring the town
where his brand is based.

Even as a child growing up in the rural Umbrian village of Castel
Rigone, [Brunello Cucinelli](http://www.brunellocucinelli.com/en/) had
strong opinions about clothes. “When I was 7, my mother gave me a pair
of green velvet trousers for Christmas,” says the designer. “I buried
them in the garden behind our house because I’ve never been too fond of
green.” A decade later, he dropped out of engineering school and, in
1978, launched an eponymous line of women’s sweaters in punchy shades
inspired by United Colors of Benetton but woven in fine cashmere and
Shetland wool.

Today, Cucinelli designs ready-to-wear collections for men, women and,
as of this month, children, as well as home décor, shoes and handbags.
The 66-year-old oversees a factory and some 1,000 workers in the hamlet
of
[Solomeo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/21/fashion/brunello-cucinelli-italy.html)
(population 500), which is nine miles from
[Perugia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/14/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-perugia-italy.html)
and 15 from his hometown. He’s spent decades improving and restoring
Solomeo — repaving roads, planting vineyards, erecting a
16th-century-style theater and founding an arts and crafts school — and
over time it’s become nearly synonymous with the label itself, which is
best known for what Cucinelli describes as “sportivo chic.” That means
plush and drapey cardigans and crew necks, softly tailored trousers and
cashmere-covered collectibles (soccer balls, waste bins) in a serene
earth-toned palette reflective of the landscape that surrounds those
that work, eat and live in Cucinelli’s domain. The designer’s
understated wares are popular with the Silicon Valley crowd — [Steve
Jobs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/steve-jobs)’s
black mock
[turtlenecks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/03/magazine/can-the-turtleneck-ever-be-cool-again.html)
were custom Cucinelli, as are [Mark
Zuckerberg](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/mark-zuckerberg)’s
signature gray T-shirts — and yet the designer himself is proudly
old-fashioned. “I want everything I create to be totally timeless, much
like a good book,” says Cucinelli. “It should be something you keep
forever and go back to over and over.”

yarn. I have about a hundred of these sorts of samples in my office and
mix the different colors to create custom shades, blending a red and an
ecru, say. All of our cashmere comes from Mongolia and Inner Mongolia,
where I’ve traveled and helped shear the goats myself.”

I am able to explain exactly what I want after playing with fabric and
test-wearing things — a jacket should sit just close enough to the
chest, and the length of a hem is paramount. This sketch shows a look I
came up with for our fall 2019 men’s wear collection: a burgundy velvet
suit worn with a single-pleated pant and a suede desert
boot.”

I’m on the far left, and I have to say, I think I look pretty good.
After all, I was only in my 40s back

Beneath the Renaissance-style arches of the dining room you’ll see

was founded in the 14th century, but by the 1950s, few people and fewer
jobs remained. Over the last 30 years, I’ve helped to restore it by
building a theater, a winery and, of course, our factories, which I hope
will be around for another century or two. I suppose I feel a bit like a
custodian for this place, which is surrounded by beautiful countryside
on all
sides.”
