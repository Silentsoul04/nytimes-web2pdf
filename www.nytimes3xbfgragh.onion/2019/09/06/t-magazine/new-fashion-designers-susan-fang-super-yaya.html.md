## Fall Risk by John Targon

*John Targon, 36, New York*

John Targon is already a familiar name in the fashion world. As a
co-founder of the New York-based **** brand Baja East and the former
creative director of Marc Jacobs’s contemporary ventures, the
36-year-old Chicago native has been in the industry’s limelight on and
off for half a decade. In 2017, after leaving Baja East, Targon took a
step back from fashion. “I wanted to shut the door on shame and bring
forward my life’s learnings,” he says. This ultimately led to his new
label, [Fall Risk](https://www.instagram.com/fallriskinc/) by John
Targon, which he launched in April of this year. The name is lifted from
the wristbands given to medical patients, which caught Targon’s eye when
he was looking out for an intoxicated friend at a hospital in New York.
“Life is unexpected and these chapters of our story are both humbling
and hilarious — your clothes should reflect that,” he says. Instead of
showing seasonal collections, Targon is selling his garments — which are
inspired by retro sportswear and streetwear — directly to his customers
while creating buzz through social media. A knitwear expert, Targon
seeks to create comfortable yet thoughtful clothing that is seasonless
and uncomplicated. “My clothes should be a second skin so that when
you’re comfortable in them, well then, they’re yours,” he says. His
latest collection, which will be Fall Risk’s fourth, is inspired by the
idea of remix, and it references the ’70s and ’90s as well as pieces
from his own past collections. There’s also a subtle sports motif, seen
in an argyle polo shirt inspired by boarding school uniforms and a
chunky powder-blue sleeveless sweater with a shrunken fit.

## Puppets and Puppets

*Carly Mark, 31, and Ayla Argentina, 27, New York*

Carly Mark and Ayla Argentina met in 2016 through a mutual friend in New
York City. Mark was working as a contemporary artist at the time but
considering a career change (she had previously interned at Versace and
Marc Jacobs before working as a gallery assistant at Gavin Brown’s
Enterprise). “Once I realized fashion didn’t have to be corporate, and
the art world was more corporate than I had anticipated, I moved back
toward clothes again. This time feeling very free about it,” she says.
Argentina (who uses the pronoun “they”), had a background in fashion
design, having interned and worked for brands such as Ralph Lauren and
TSE Cashmere. Mark asked Argentina to collaborate on costumes for a
video she was working on for a solo exhibition. Shortly after, Argentina
joined Mark’s art studio as her costume assistant and they continued to
create garments for her work. In 2018, they debuted a collection of
their pieces — patchwork suits and dramatic fuzzy dusters inspired by
medieval garb — during New York Fashion Week, and the brand [Puppets and
Puppets](https://www.puppetsandpuppets.com/) was born. For the spring
2020 season, the designers will present their second collection, which
Mark describes as “Romanov meets ‘American Psycho.’” Expect to see
tailored suits evocative of Wall Street businessmen mixed with
Russian-inspired outerwear and hoop skirts. “Fashion is so corporate
here that there is a pushback happening,” Mark says. “Young designers
are doing it their way, on their terms, whatever way they
want.”

## Eftychia

*Eftychia Karamolegkou, London*

Eftychia Karamolegkou always had an eye for design. She grew up in
Greece surrounded by paintings and hand-carved furniture made by her
grandfather, a trained architect and self-taught artist, which continue
to define her minimal aesthetic. Later, she worked in graphic design
before enrolling in the fashion design master’s course at Central Saint
Martins and interning for the London-based brands Mary Katrantzou and
Marques Almeida. Her graduate collection, shown in 2017, centered on
suiting and quickly caught the attention of stores such as Opening
Ceremony and [Machine
A](https://www.machine-a.com/collections/designer-eftychia), prompting
her to found her own namesake label that same year. The brand still
focuses on innovative tailoring; Karamolegkou takes inspiration from
office wear, which she then transforms with baggy cuts and neutral
colors. “I think I gravitate toward tailoring because it is a kind of
secret language,” she says. “It has so many codes that by changing
details, you can reveal different messages.” For her next collection,
she mined business meetings and corporate hierarchies for inspiration,
creating imaginary characters that informed her pieces. The archetypal
chairman, for example, who doesn’t need to prove himself and can adopt a
more relaxed look, inspired a clean loose fitted shirt paired with
relaxed trousers, while for a C.E.O. she designed a full suit.
Karamolegkou’s signature two-tone technique, in which she mixes tonal
browns in one suiting fabric, will reoccur in this collection along with
new styles such as a wool mohair Harrington
jacket.

## Paula Canovas del Vas

*Paula Canovas del Vas, 28, London*

[Paula Canovas del Vas](https://paulacanovasdelvas.com/) was born and
raised in Murcia, Spain, where she spent much of her childhood at her
mother’s bridal dress store learning from the atelier’s seamstresses and
patternmakers. In 2013, she moved to London to freelance at the British
brand Ashish and later interned at Gucci in Rome and Margiela in Paris —
but she always wanted to design her own collections and began working on
her own label while studying for her master’s at Central Saint Martins.
In 2018, her graduate collection of fantastically patterned neon jackets
was picked up by Dover Street Market in Tokyo. “My tendency is to
gravitate toward shieldlike volumes,” she says of her oversize,
eye-catching shapes. “There is something very comforting about wearing
them.” This month, Vas will present her third collection in London via a
virtual reality installation that will be open to the public. The idea
was partly inspired by the idea of voyeurism and the personal
broadcasting made possible by social media. “I wanted to offer an
alternative to a fashion catwalk and encapsulate the experience in a way
that would be long-lasting and democratized,” she says. Vas also wanted
to give viewers insight into how she sources her upcycled materials and
works with artisans in southern Spain to develop her fabrics, such as
synthetic patent leather and whimsically embossed knits. One particular
dress in the new collection, which was constructed from 10 meters of
pink and green dead-stock organza, took two weeks to
make.

## Susan Fang

*Susan Fang, 26, Milan*

[Susan Fang](https://www.susanfangofficial.com/) began designing clothes
at age 5, for the girls in her comic books. Born in Yuyao, China, she
moved from place to place during her childhood, from China to England,
Canada and the U.S. “It was a lot of changes,” she says. “But it made me
extremely interested in the difference between people’s perceptions and
perspectives.” Fang became passionate about exploring the arts, culture
and fashion of the places in which she lived, and she eventually settled
in London, where she studied fashion at Central Saint Martins. After
graduating, she spent two years gaining experience at Celine and Stella
McCartney before founding her eponymous label in 2018. Characterized by
naturalistic and geometric motifs, her otherworldly pieces include bags
made from bubblelike glass beads and sheer pastel dresses, but perhaps
her most notable invention is the “airweave,” a garment made from strips
of featherlight fabric (such as chiffon, yarn) that shape-shifts as the
wearer moves, creating the impression, in Fang’s words, that her
garments “swim between two and three dimensions.” Although she is still
based in London, Fang will show her spring 2020 collection in Milan, at
the invitation of Sara Maino, Editor of Vogue Talents, a platform
dedicated to emerging designers. Fang was also shortlisted for the LVMH
Prize this year. Her new collection will be filled with optical
illusions and unexpected materials, she says: “It will be very surreal
and
ethereal.”

## Super Yaya

*Rym Beydoun, 29, Paris*

For her placement year at Central Saint Martins, the designer Rym
Beydoun decided to go back home to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and take a step
back from the fashion scene. “I wanted to be in Africa and reconnect
with people and the culture,” she explains. While there, she started to
teach herself about the different textile weaving, dying and printing
techniques of ethnic groups across the continent. Later that year, she
interned at Uniwax, a wax print manufacturer in West Africa where she
worked with street tailors to make custom suits, and at the
Abidjan-based clothing label Laurenceairline. After graduating, she then
moved to Beirut to work on her own pieces and in 2017 launched [Super
Yaya](http://www.super-yaya.com/), a line of colorful clothes made from
fabrics inspired by the different places where she’s lived and traveled.
For her next collection, she looked to Indonesia and the tradition of
bati, a technique of wax-resist dyeing on fabrics. “I conducted research
and gathered old photographs depicting Indonesian dress and compared
them to the ones I had from Abidjan, Bamako and Dakar,” she says. “I go
to places for inspiration, specifically markets where I can exchange and
learn from traders. I usually need to build my own research by taking
photographs of the people and environment.” Her new garments will
feature a lot of patchworks made of hand-dyed bazin and wax fabric (both
colorful African fabrics made of cotton). These fabrics are manipulated
together to create an explosion of color as well as transparency,
creating a sensual yet modest feel.
