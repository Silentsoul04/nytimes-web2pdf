When the designer [Jason Wu](https://www.jasonwustudio.com/) was 10
years old, his mother bought him his first sewing machine. Soon, he was
teaching himself pattern-making, fitting and other techniques that would
shape his precocious fashion career — all while designing dresses for
his dolls. “My mom would take me to the fabric store and I’d get a
quarter-yard of fabric,” says Wu. “That was where I spent my allowance.”
Of course, these were not simple shifts. One of his early creations was
a miniature version of a Christian Lacroix couture dress, made from
silk. “It came out pretty well,” Wu remembers.

*for the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors
are noticing and coveting now.\]*

It’s no surprise, then, that the designer’s wild-card pick for Make T
Something was a doll — one chosen from [Fashion
Royalty](https://www.integritytoys.com/brands/fashion-royalty/fashion-royalty-2019/),
the couture-outfitted doll collection Wu conceived in 2000, and still
creates designs for today. For the dress, he interpreted a floor-length
gown in his floral-inspired fall 2019 collection, swapping layers of
raw-edged red silk for newsprint torn from the front page of The New
York Times’s Food section. “There happened to be a really large
fried-chicken image,” says Wu, “Cooking is my favorite pastime, so it’s
a wink to my personal interests — and it made a particularly nice
color.”

To create the dress, Wu built armature out of wire to mimic the boning
and construction of the full-size clothes; he balled up the paper to
create the texture of a wrinkled fabric. Despite the care put into the
piece, though, Wu isn’t precious about the end result. “I want to
uncrumple the dress so I can use that fried chicken recipe,” he says. “I
just got an air fryer.”
