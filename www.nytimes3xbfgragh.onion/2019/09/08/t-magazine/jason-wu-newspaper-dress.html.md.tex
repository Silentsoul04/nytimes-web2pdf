The designer is the latest person to accept the challenge to make
something for T.

When the designer \href{https://www.jasonwustudio.com/}{Jason Wu} was 10
years old, his mother bought him his first sewing machine. Soon, he was
teaching himself pattern-making, fitting and other techniques that would
shape his precocious fashion career --- all while designing dresses for
his dolls. ``My mom would take me to the fabric store and I'd get a
quarter-yard of fabric,'' says Wu. ``That was where I spent my
allowance.'' Of course, these were not simple shifts. One of his early
creations was a miniature version of a Christian Lacroix couture dress,
made from silk. ``It came out pretty well,'' Wu remembers.

Magazine editors are noticing and coveting now.{]}}

It's no surprise, then, that the designer's wild-card pick for Make T
Something was a doll --- one chosen from
\href{https://www.integritytoys.com/brands/fashion-royalty/fashion-royalty-2019/}{Fashion
Royalty}, the couture-outfitted doll collection Wu conceived in 2000,
and still creates designs for today. For the dress, he interpreted a
floor-length gown in his floral-inspired fall 2019 collection, swapping
layers of raw-edged red silk for newsprint torn from the front page of
The New York Times's Food section. ``There happened to be a really large
fried-chicken image,'' says Wu, ``Cooking is my favorite pastime, so
it's a wink to my personal interests --- and it made a particularly nice
color.''

To create the dress, Wu built armature out of wire to mimic the boning
and construction of the full-size clothes; he balled up the paper to
create the texture of a wrinkled fabric. Despite the care put into the
piece, though, Wu isn't precious about the end result. ``I want to
uncrumple the dress so I can use that fried chicken recipe,'' he says.
``I just got an air fryer.''
