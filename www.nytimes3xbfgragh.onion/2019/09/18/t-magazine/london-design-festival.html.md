## “Bamboo Ring: Weaving Into Lightness” by Kengo Kuma

It feels fitting that Kengo Kuma’s “[Bamboo Ring: Weaving Into
Lightness](http://londondesignfestival.com/event/bamboo-zhu-ring-weaving-lightness)”
would be given pride of place inside the courtyard of the Victoria &
Albert Museum in London. Kuma, an architect based in Tokyo, designed the
institution’s first northern outpost, the V\&A Dundee, a powerful
pyramidical structure that sits on the River Tay. More than a decade in
the making, the Scottish site celebrates its first anniversary this
month. For the London Design Festival, Kuma imagined a similarly
striking sculpture in Japanese bamboo interwoven with carbon fiber — a
cross between a nest and a supersize Slinky.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The piece taps into Kuma’s recollections of playing in the bamboo forest
behind his childhood home in Kanagawa, Japan. “It’s a very important
memory for me — the smell, the green color and the softness of the
forest floor,” says the designer, whose meditative bamboo spiral
levitates above the garden’s oval pool. Kuma’s hope is that this
carbon-strengthened woven technique can be applied to permanent
structures in the future — **** a naturalistic architectural vision that
draws closer with the completion of his timber lattice stadium for the
2020 Olympics in Tokyo. “Unlike steel, bamboo has a warmness and a
softness to it that people really crave,” he says. “Here, the light
bamboo structure is in complete harmony with the peaceful beauty of the
V\&A
gardens.”

## “Please Sit,” at Fenton House

The **** furniture and exhibition designer Gitta Gschwendtner makes her
curatorial debut at [Fenton
House](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/fenton-house-and-garden) with
the tellingly titled show “[Please
Sit](https://www.londondesignfestival.com/event/please-sit).”
Gschwendtner invited five designers to take the 17th-century merchant’s
house in Hampstead, North London, as their starting point and create
seating installations positioned throughout the National Trust property.
“The brief was to create an intervention that made visitors dwell longer
and to unlock some of the stories of the house,” she says. Inhabited
until 1952 by Lady Katherine Binning, a collector of ceramics, antique
furniture and needlepoint embroidery, it’s a decorative treasure trove
on an unusually intimate scale. Each installation taps into the
eccentricities of Lady Binning’s life: In the drawing room, Nina
Tolstrup of Studiomama created an abstract mahogany bench that echoes
the shapes of the house’s harpsichord collection, and Frith Kerr of
Studio Frith turned the bedroom into a haven of kitsch, casting her
ceramic poodle collection as shiny orange pillows strewn across the bed.
**** “The idea is to question taste,” Gschwendtner says. “They look like
pumpkins — but they’re crazy poodle-inspired puffballs.” Gschwendtner’s
own Jacob’s ladder-style chairs, which nod to Binning’s love of
needlework, can be found in the garden, which includes a 400-year-old
apple orchard.

## “Life Labyrinth,” at Westminster Cathedral

It’s been 10 years since Anna Murray and Grace Winteringham established
Patternity, a project-led design studio and online archive that
celebrates the all-encompassing power of pattern. The duo’s third major
London Design Festival commission, titled “[Life
Labyrinth](https://www.londondesignfestival.com/event/life-labyrinth),”
is a monumental monochrome maze outside Westminster Cathedral (not to be
confused with the rather grander Westminster Abbey down the street).
“It’s a celebration of the architecture of one of the most
underappreciated buildings in London,” Murray says of the installation’s
graphic stripes, which mirror the cathedral’s Byzantine-style décor.
Inspired by the long heritage of the labyrinth, a geometric symbol that
appears across religious denominations and throughout the natural world,
Murray and Winteringham believe that walking through the maze will
encourage self-reflection and insight — or just a moment to enjoy the
miniature garden at the center. “The spiraling formation is meant to be
meditative,” Murray says. “It definitely feels significant to be
creating a space for contemplation in Westminster, which is the
epicenter of political chaos at the
moment.”

## “Urushi Wajima,” at Gallery Fumi

The first time the London-based designer [Max Lamb](http://maxlamb.org/)
dabbled in *urushi* — a centuries-old Japanese lacquerware technique —
he was undiscerning of theintricacy of the process. “Just looking at
pictures in my studio in London, I couldn’t tell the difference between
a piece of plastic and a piece of lacquerware,” he admits. For a project
in 2010, Lamb presented a stool as part of a group show at the Japanese
Embassy in London that was designed in his studio then shipped to Japan
to undergo the urushi technique. Now, he returns to the craft with
“[Urushi
Wajima](https://www.londondesignfestival.com/event/urushi-wajima-max-lamb),”
a forensically executed, heartfelt showcase of the many skilled pairs of
hands — 23 to be precise — involved in the making of the cabinets,
stools, tables, benches and Wajima-nuri bowls of Lamb’s design. “It’s a
celebration of the city of Wajima and its community of craftspeople,” he
says of the show, which also spotlights the makers’ own work. “From the
timber growers to the wood splitters to the top coaters and polishers.”

It’s an unusually hands-off approach for Lamb, who spent many weeks and
months over the course of six years in Wajima — a fishing port in
northeastern Japan known for its morning market — immersed in the urushi
community. “I love its pureness,” he says of the material. “It’s
essentially created using sap from a tree so it’s entirely renewable
since it can be grown and harvested.” Unlike plastic, which fades over
time, urushi hardens and develops a deeper, darker and richer patina.
“It creates such a juicy and luscious surface finish,” Lamb says. “The
sheer number of processes involved in the making of urushi means you end
up with the glossiest thing on the
planet.”

## “Never Lost,” at CitizenM

“Childlike, but not childish,” is how the British designer and artist
Emily Alston — who works under the moniker [Emily
Forgot](http://www.emilyforgot.co.uk/) — describes her joyful furniture
and sculptural objects. “I can’t be too serious — even if I try.” Alston
typically wears her architectural influences on her sleeve: Miniature
wooden assemblages are modeled after the otherworldly buildings of
Ricardo Bofill and Richard England, while the graphic rugs and
furnishings she created for the Dutch department store De Bijenkorf
celebrate the clean-lined beauty of the Bauhaus. Now, Alston realizes
her color-blocked vision on a heightened scale with “[Never
Lost](https://www.londondesignfestival.com/event/never-lost-citizenm-shoreditch),”
a geometric maze inside the courtyard of citizenM in Shoreditch, East
London. This interconnecting series of rooms and passageways — hand
painted in a punchy palette of Yves Klein blue, mint green and tomato
orange — has dead-end spaces to encourage deviation. “Mazes are the most
surreal structure I can think of,” Alston says gleefully. “Normally you
try to avoid taking wrong turns, but here they can lead to interesting
discoveries.”

## Granby Workshop in King’s Cross

[Granby
Workshop](https://www.londondesignfestival.com/event/granby-workshop-launch-worlds-first-ceramic-tableware-made-100-waste)
in Liverpool is one of Britain’s most inventive ceramics studios. A
community-led practice, it was initially a place to make decorative
features — fireplaces, door handles and bathroom tiles — to furnish the
rows of Victorian houses being regenerated by the architectural
collective Assemble, together with the Community Land Trust. That
project, which won the 2015 Turner Prize, remains underway: The group
just received permission to transform a derelict building into a cafe
and apartments, and its facade will be clad in Granby tiles.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now the workshop has created a collection of ceramic tableware, forged
entirely from waste materials. Everything from discarded refractory
bricks and laboratory test tubes to tiles from their own kiln are ****
ground up coarsely and bound together with wastewater from
industrial-scale producers, many in the nearby ceramics center of
Stoke-on-Trent. “When the ceramics factories hose down their machines,
we get the sludge,” explains Lewis Jones of the Granby Workshop team.
“The irony is that although it’s an incredibly pure and refined
material it’s also quite inconsistent, so we have to get every batch
chemically analyzed in a lab and then adjust our ingredients
accordingly.” This hardy-looking table service, which comes in six
shades from multihued to mushroom, goes on display at Coal Drops Yard in
London’s Kings Cross as part of a 28-day Kickstarter campaign to raise
the funds for the project to move into full-fledged production. “It’s
like alchemy,” Jones says of the complex, time-consuming and careful
process. “After all, this is the world’s first 100 percent recycled
ceramic
tableware.”

## “The Incredible House of Cards,” at the Redchurch Rooms

“The house of cards’s geometric shape has long connections to modernist
architecture — it’s such an iconic design,” says Petrus Palmér, the
founder of the Stockholm furniture maker Hem. For “[Hem at
Play](https://www.londondesignfestival.com/event/hem-play),” the company
commissioned Bertjan Pot, a renegade Dutch designer, to create **** a
decorative accessory that draws on the house of cards’s modular form —
most memorably replicated by Ray and Charles Eames in 1952 — in durable,
die-cut [G.F Smith](https://www.gfsmith.com/)paper. Hem has decked the
exterior of the Redchurch Room exhibition space in a graphic mural that
echoes Pot’s pyramidical patterned creation, making it hard for visitors
to the [Shoreditch Design
Triangle](https://www.shoreditchdesigntriangle.com/) to miss. Alongside
the “Incredible House of Cards” will be the fruits of Hem’s other recent
collaborations, with the ceramist John Booth and the designer Max Lamb —
all part of Palmér’s mission to supercharge what he sees as a lackluster
middle market with compellingly creative and affordable design.

## “Masters of Disguise,” in South Kensington

Masks are having a moment at this year’s [Brompton Design
District](https://bromptondesigndistrict.com/), one of the most
thoughtfully curated quarters of the festival. For “Masters of
Disguise,”
[SEEDS](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/30/t-magazine/design/nathalie-assi-seeds-gallery.html),
an experimental design platform, adorns a South Kensington townhouse
with masks, furniture and decorative objects by 20 artists including
Martino Gamper, Bethan Laura Wood and Nathalie Du Pasquier. The results
are brilliantly, dizzyingly diverse. There’s Wood’s netted veil,
stitched with a strong-browed self-portrait; a preternaturally glossy
pink resin block from Sabine Marcelis; and a kitschy mirrored ode to
Murano by Lucia Massari. Nearby a palatial table created by the show’s
curator, Marco Campardo, of M-L-XL, is set for dinner with the
sculptural glassware of Jochen Holz and the glass-specked ceramics of
his partner, Attua Aparicio. To delve into the identity-altering magic
of masks on a more monumental scale, head to the [V\&A’s tapestry
galler](https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/tapestry)y around the corner.
In the exhibition “[Black Masking
Culture](https://www.vam.ac.uk/event/rKRpwj5N/bras-coupe-ldf-installation-sept-2019),”
the breathtaking hand-sewn Mardi Gras suits of the artist Big Chief
Demond Melancon of the Young Seminole Hunters, his **** tribe in the
Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans are on display for the first time
outside the United States.
