# What Is Activated Charcoal Used For, and Does it Really Work?

Proponents claim that activated charcoal is a “natural detoxifier” that
can remove harmful substances from the
body.

Active charcoal comes in many forms: toothpaste; powders, black-colored
ice-cream, or “goth lattes.” On Instagram, it is used as a prop.
Medically, activated charcoal is used in emergency hospital settings,
typically to absorb drugs after an overdose.

## What is activated charcoal said to do?

Proponents contend that activated charcoal is a natural detoxifier of
the body that can, for example, remove teeth stains and even work as an
anti-aging product. After all, if it can medically detoxify the body of
poisons, a smaller dose probably works too, right?

Not necessarily. Just to clarify so no one goes sprinkling charcoal in
their latte: [Activated charcoal is
charcoal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767212/)that has
undergone a process in which gases like oxygen are added at high
temperatures, resulting in pores that provide a high surface area that
allows it to bind to other substances.

## Does activated charcoal do anything?

A [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767212/) in the
British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in 2015 reported that activated
charcoal has pores that soak up fluid. It is often derived from burned
organic substances, such as coconut shells (as in coconut ash). Dr. Mark
Su, a medical toxicologist and director of the New York City Poison
Control Center, said that activated charcoal worked by binding to drugs
to prevent absorption in the body.

There are side effects in the emergency department setting, like
vomiting or pulmonary **** aspiration. Activated charcoal also doesn’t
work on [certain
alcohols](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767212/#bcp12793-bib-0013).
Some hospitals prefer not to use it in the emergency department and
instead opt for more specific antidotes to poisonings and overdoses.

For the rest of us, [our
liver](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20374502)
and [our
kidneys](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354527)
do a great job of detoxifying things on a day-to-day basis.

If optimal health is the goal, eating healthfully — plenty of green,
leafy vegetables — sleeping at least seven to eight hours a day,
exercising at least three times a week at an intensity where you sweat
(sweat is detoxifying), reducing stress through mindfulness, journaling,
and cultivating community and a strong support network are helpful
habits to
introduce.

## Can activated charcoal harm you?

It’s possible that activated charcoal[may reduce the effectiveness of
certain medications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3285126/)
like those for high blood pressure or seizures.

In New York, Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream, made with coconut ash, was
wildly popular, but in 2018 the company was served “[commissioner’s
orders”](https://ny.eater.com/2018/6/7/17435290/activated-charcoal-food-nyc)
from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to stop
serving it. The company complied, and the Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene has [continued to crack down on coconut
ash](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/229677/20180607/new-york-city-department-of-health-bans-black-foods-that-contain-activated-charcoal.htm),
though Michael Lanza, the assistant press secretary for the department,
said in an emailed statement, “Restaurants may serve foods with
activated charcoal after securing approval from the F.D.A.” (Stores like
Pressed Juicery still sell activated charcoal lemonade in stores outside
New York, though not online, citing the ban.)

In the 1960s, the Food and Drug Administration prohibited the use of
activated charcoal in food additives or coloring, but an F.D.A.
spokeswoman said in an email that the ban was precautionary, as there
was a lack of safety data.

## What about activated charcoal in health and beauty?

The questions about the use of activated charcoal in foods have not
stopped the trend of activated charcoal moving into health and beauty.
A[study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673027) from January
2019, which involved staining cow, goat and sheep teeth with
concentrated black tea, found that activated charcoal in toothpaste was
not as effective as other whitening agents like hydrogen peroxide or
microbeads.

A [previous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28599961) review from
2017 of 118 studies found that there was not enough evidence to support
the safety or efficacy of charcoal-based toothpastes and powders and
that their safety hadn’t been demonstrated. On balance, given the
alternatives, and the risks of ingestion, it is better to stick with
safer toothpaste substances, the review suggests.

On the other hand, Dr. Su said there was no clear concern at this time
about charcoal’s safety for beauty products for external
use.
