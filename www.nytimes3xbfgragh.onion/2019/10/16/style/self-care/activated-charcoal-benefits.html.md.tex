Proponents claim that activated charcoal is a ``natural detoxifier''
that can remove harmful substances from the body.

Active charcoal comes in many forms: toothpaste; powders, black-colored
ice-cream, or ``goth lattes.'' On Instagram, it is used as a prop.
Medically, activated charcoal is used in emergency hospital settings,
typically to absorb drugs after an overdose.

Proponents contend that activated charcoal is a natural detoxifier of
the body that can, for example, remove teeth stains and even work as an
anti-aging product. After all, if it can medically detoxify the body of
poisons, a smaller dose probably works too, right?

Not necessarily. Just to clarify so no one goes sprinkling charcoal in
their latte:
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767212/}{Activated
charcoal is charcoal}that has undergone a process in which gases like
oxygen are added at high temperatures, resulting in pores that provide a
high surface area that allows it to bind to other substances.

A \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767212/}{review}
in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in 2015 reported that
activated charcoal has pores that soak up fluid. It is often derived
from burned organic substances, such as coconut shells (as in coconut
ash). Dr. Mark Su, a medical toxicologist and director of the New York
City Poison Control Center, said that activated charcoal worked by
binding to drugs to prevent absorption in the body.

There are side effects in the emergency department setting, like
vomiting or pulmonary **** aspiration. Activated charcoal also doesn't
work on
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767212/\#bcp12793-bib-0013}{certain
alcohols}. Some hospitals prefer not to use it in the emergency
department and instead opt for more specific antidotes to poisonings and
overdoses.

For the rest of us,
\href{https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20374502}{our
liver} and
\href{https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354527}{our
kidneys} do a great job of detoxifying things on a day-to-day basis.

If optimal health is the goal, eating healthfully --- plenty of green,
leafy vegetables --- sleeping at least seven to eight hours a day,
exercising at least three times a week at an intensity where you sweat
(sweat is detoxifying), reducing stress through mindfulness, journaling,
and cultivating community and a strong support network are helpful
habits to introduce.

It's possible that activated
charcoal\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/3285126/}{may reduce
the effectiveness of certain medications} like those for high blood
pressure or seizures.

In New York, Morgenstern's Finest Ice Cream, made with coconut ash, was
wildly popular, but in 2018 the company was served
``\href{https://ny.eater.com/2018/6/7/17435290/activated-charcoal-food-nyc}{commissioner's
orders''} from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
to stop serving it. The company complied, and the Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene has
\href{https://www.techtimes.com/articles/229677/20180607/new-york-city-department-of-health-bans-black-foods-that-contain-activated-charcoal.htm}{continued
to crack down on coconut ash}, though Michael Lanza, the assistant press
secretary for the department, said in an emailed statement,
``Restaurants may serve foods with activated charcoal after securing
approval from the F.D.A.'' (Stores like Pressed Juicery still sell
activated charcoal lemonade in stores outside New York, though not
online, citing the ban.)

In the 1960s, the Food and Drug Administration prohibited the use of
activated charcoal in food additives or coloring, but an F.D.A.
spokeswoman said in an email that the ban was precautionary, as there
was a lack of safety data.

\subsection{What about activated charcoal in health and
beauty?}\label{what-about-activated-charcoal-in-health-and-beauty}}

The questions about the use of activated charcoal in foods have not
stopped the trend of activated charcoal moving into health and beauty.
A\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673027}{study} from January
2019, which involved staining cow, goat and sheep teeth with
concentrated black tea, found that activated charcoal in toothpaste was
not as effective as other whitening agents like hydrogen peroxide or
microbeads.

A \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28599961}{previous} review
from 2017 of 118 studies found that there was not enough evidence to
support the safety or efficacy of charcoal-based toothpastes and powders
and that their safety hadn't been demonstrated. On balance, given the
alternatives, and the risks of ingestion, it is better to stick with
safer toothpaste substances, the review suggests.

On the other hand, Dr. Su said there was no clear concern at this time
about charcoal's safety for beauty products for external use.
