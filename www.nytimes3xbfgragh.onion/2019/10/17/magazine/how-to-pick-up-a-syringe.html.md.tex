``No exposed flesh,'' says Mayia Ogbebor, the syringe-disposal program
manager for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, which runs a 12-person,
12-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week needle-pickup crew funded by the city's
public health department. Since the program started in June 2018, the
team has collected 275,000 used syringes left by intravenous-drug users
in gutters and doorways; jammed in car tires; even stuck, birthday
candle-like, in feces. Wear long pants, covered shoes and latex gloves
to fetch needles. Never use your bare hands. Carry a trash picker or
tongs and a medical-grade sharps container. If you spot a used syringe,
place your container on the flat ground, grasp the needle with your
picker, then push it into the sharps bin, needle side first.

You'll get better at spotting syringes with practice. ``You develop an
eye,'' Ogbebor says. Many, but not all, have a telltale bright orange
cap. Check under bushes and shrubs. Untrained citizens should leave
syringes alone and report them to city officials. (Ogbebor's crew tries
to respond to such reports in less than an hour.) Never allow someone to
pass you a syringe. Instead, request that it be put on the ground so
that you can follow safe pickup protocol. Stay courteous; you're not
there to judge. ``We ask people, `Is it O.K. if we pick up this
syringe?' '' Ogbebor says.

Carry a ``stick kit'' in case of an accidental poke. If that happens,
squeeze a few drops of blood from the wound, clean it with an
antibacterial wipe, pour saline solution over it, bandage it and go to
the hospital. Don't exceed your container's fill line. Used syringes are
hazardous medical waste and should be disposed of accordingly; never put
them in the garbage. Prepare to find more at the beginning of the month
than at the end. ``That's when people get paid,'' says Ogbebor, whose
team uses an app to mark where and when they find needles, in order to
create a detritus pattern map of the city's estimated 22,500 injecting
drug users. Know that you will be out among them and may be called upon
to help. Her team members go out in pairs carrying Narcan, a drug used
to revive those overdosing on opioids. ``We see overdoses,'' Ogbebor
says. ``We see people who have died.''
