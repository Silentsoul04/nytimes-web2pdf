Family members at the party, where expectant parents were announcing the
sex of their baby, inadvertently created a pipe bomb that killed a woman
in Iowa, a sheriff said.

A woman in Iowa died during a gender reveal announcement on Saturday
after flying debris from an explosion from what amounted to a homemade
pipe bomb struck her, the authorities said on Monday.

The woman, Pamela Kreimeyer, 56, died instantly after she was struck in
the head by a piece of metal from a device that was intended to reveal
the sex of the baby, the Marion County Sheriff's Office said in a
statement on Monday.

Guests gather at gender reveal parties to watch expectant parents
announce the sex of their baby. The announcements have become more
elaborate, with some involving plumes of smoke, pops of confetti or
explosive effects to the shades of blue and pink.

On Saturday afternoon, members of the Kreimeyer family and the expectant
mother were at a home in Knoxville, Iowa, about 40 miles southeast of
Des Moines.

``Our investigation showed that members of the Kreimeyer family were
experimenting with different types of explosive material on Friday and
Saturday in an attempt to record a gender reveal that could be posted on
social media for friends and family,'' the statement said.

The family was trying to create a device that could shoot colored powder
into the air to share the gender of the baby, the statement said.

Gunpowder was placed in the bottom of a homemade stand that was welded
to a metal base.

``A hole had been drilled in the side for a fuse, a piece of wood was
placed on top of the gunpowder and colored powder was placed on top of
the board,'' the statement said. ``Tape was then wrapped over the top of
the metal tubing, inadvertently creating a pipe bomb. Instead of the
gunpowder shooting the powder out the top of the stand, the stand
exploded sending metal pieces flying.''

One of these metal pieces struck Ms. Kreimeyer in the head, ``causing
instant death,'' the statement said.

She was standing with other family members about 45 feet from the
device. The projectile that struck her continued 144 yards farther
through the air and landed in a field, the statement said.

``This family got together for what they thought was going to be a happy
event with no intent for anyone to get hurt,'' Sheriff Jason Sandholdt
said in the statement. ``This is a reminder that any time someone mixes
these things there is a high potential for serious injury or death.
Please do not take these unnecessary risks.''

Gender reveal parties have gained popularity on social media but some
have gone awry.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/01/us/gender-reveal-arizona-fire.html?module=inline}{A
United States Border Patrol agent's gender reveal} party in Arizona last
year sparked a fire that consumed more than 45,000 acres and caused more
than \$8 million in damage.

The agent, Dennis Dickey, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of
federal Forest Service regulations because of the explosion at his
gender reveal party. The fire, which came to be known as the Sawmill
Fire, required 800 firefighters working a week to put it out.

Australia}, a car that began slowly expelling blue smoke to announce the
gender of a baby burst into flames. The driver, who jumped out of the
vehicle, was convicted of dangerous operation of a car.
