# Just How Bad Are the Miami Dolphins?

</div>

Monday night’s loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers looked bad, as did the
six before it. But are the winless Dolphins the N.F.L.’s worst team?

The Miami Dolphins lost on Monday night. Again. That makes them 0-7 on
the season.

It says something about the
[Dolphins’](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/science/dolphins-shells-learning.html)
performances this year that even when they took a surprise 14-0 lead on
the Steelers in the first quarter — [Pittsburgh fans
booed](https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=401128074) the home team,
an act quarterback Mason Rudolph said was justified given the early
going — few thought Miami would actually hang on and win. Sure enough,
the Dolphins did not score again and lost, 27-14.

The Dolphins seemed to have given up on the season long before Monday
night, but the exact timing of that decision remains in dispute.
Tuesday’s [trade for cornerback Aqib
Talib](https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/1189248844359438336),
who is on the injured reserve list, reportedly involved swapping a
sixth-round pick for a fifth-rounder, a move that seems to lay bare the
team’s strategy of collecting assets.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But some would say the team forfeited way earlier, when it traded away
left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills to the Houston
Texans for picks before the first regular season game. Safety Minkah
Fitzpatrick was sent to the Steelers in September (he had two
interceptions on Monday) and running back Kenyan Drake got traded to the
Arizona Cardinals for a conditional draft pick this week.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

All that talent leaving has caused plenty of speculation that the
Dolphins are losing now to set up their franchise’s future. [The Miami
Herald reported last
month](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/barry-jackson/article234548232.html)
that owner Stephen Ross said last January that the team’s goal was to
position itself to take a top quarterback in 2020.

Who knows what the team’s moves will yield? Anyone watching the Dolphins
play this season is confronted with a more answerable question: Are they
the league’s worst? The Cincinnati Bengals (0-8) haven’t won yet either,
and there are some other pretty poor teams. And if the Dolphins are the
worst of the 2019 season, could we go further and say they are the worst
N.F.L. team of all time?

## Wins and Losses. (Or in This Case, Just Losses)

The Dolphins’ dodgy off-season moves seemed to indicate a coming fall.
Despite being a respectable 7-9 last season, they were the longest shot
to win the Super Bowl before any games were played this season, at
500-1. If you still want to bet them to win the Super Bowl, you can get
2,500-1 or more. (Frankly you might want a lot more than that.)

With eight weeks of the season played, the Dolphins are without a win,
joining the Bengals. In the past 10 years, 11 teams have gone winless to
this point, including the Dolphins themselves in 2011. (The Browns in
2016 and 2017 are the other team to do it twice in that span).

An 0-7 record means a team is bad, but it doesn’t tell us how bad.

## How Bad Are the Losses?

One way to determine the quality of a team without a win is strength of
schedule. The Dolphins’ schedule so far comes out a bit tougher than
average: 21st in the league, [according to
Pro-Football-Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/).
It includes the mighty Patriots (a 43-0 loss) as well as the Cowboys
(31-6 loss) and the Ravens (59-10 loss). But it also includes [the
woeful
Redskins](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/13/sports/football/redskins-dolphins.html)
(the Dolphins lost, 17-16, at home).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Another method to sort the abysmal teams is margin of victory (or in
this case, margin of loss). The Dolphins have thus far lost by a
startling average of 23 points. The next worst figure is the Jets (1-6),
at -15.3, while having the easiest schedule in the league. The winless
Bengals are a comparatively decent -10.8 thanks to losses of 1, 3, 4 and
6 points. Aside from that 1-point loss to the Redskins, the Dolphins’
best effort was a 10-point loss.

Last year, the worst margin of victory figure was the -12.5 average
posted by the 3-13 Arizona Cardinals. The 1-15 Rams of 2009 were
averaged -16.3 — yes, even the 1-15 and 0-16 Browns of 2016 and 2017
were a little better.

Other legendarily poor teams like the 1981 Colts (2-14, -17.1) and the
1976 Buccaneers expansion team (0-14, -20.5) also fall short of the
Dolphins. Miami has time to turn that around some, perhaps.

**Answer:** The 23-point average margin of defeat is probably the
biggest marker that the Dolphins are the worst team of the year, and
even a historically bad team.

## Offense, Defense

Good news: The Dolphins are not the worst team on offense or defense.
Bad news: They are the second worst in both. Offensively, the Dolphins
are averaging 4.3 [yards a
play](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/#team_stats::15)
and 4.8 [net yards per
pass](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/#team_stats::15),
both second worst in the league to the Jets. Defensively, they surrender
6.5 yards per play and 8.3 yards per pass, a little better than the
Bengals.

How about the pass rush? Their [hurry
percentage](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/opp.htm#advanced_defense::12)
of 6 percent and [pressure
percentage](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/opp.htm#advanced_defense::17)
of 14.8 percent are both second worst to the Oakland Raiders. Their
turnover percentage (21 percent of drives) is second worst to Giants. At
forcing turnovers (3.9 percent of drives) they are second worst to the
Atlanta Falcons.

The trouble with being second worst at almost everything is that the
teams in last tend to be at least decent at some things. The Jets
defense is about average, and the Bengals offense, while not good, is at
least ahead of a few teams. The Dolphins are the one team that seems to
always be at or near the bottom.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Answer:** The Jets, Bengals, Raiders, Giants and Falcons are worse
than the Dolphins in particular categories. But looking at everything,
no team is as bad all around.

## More Evidence

No position is more important to an N.F.L. team’s success than
quarterback, and the Dolphins have tried two. Among passers with at
least 100 attempts, [their current
starter,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/21/sports/football/backup-quarterback-teddy-bridgewater-mahomes.html)
Ryan Fitzpatrick, is the third worst in adjusted yards per pass, ahead
of Sam Darnold of the Jets. In last place is the other Dolphins
quarterback, Josh Rosen.

It’s not surprising that the handful of categories in which Dolphins are
among the leaders are negative ones, like interceptions and
interceptions returned for touchdowns. One tiny bright spot is Jakeem
Grant, who seems to be good at returning kicks. He certainly gets a lot
of practice.

Computer rankings almost all have the Dolphins at the bottom. Jeff
Sagarin ranks them last, [4 points worse than the
Redskins](https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/sagarin/), and the [Massey
ratings](https://www.masseyratings.com/nfl/ratings) also have them at
the bottom. The [Elo system at
FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-predictions/)
is the contrarian, projecting them to actually win three games and
placing them above the Bengals.

**Answer:** There is a pretty solid consensus among computers, as among
people, that the Dolphins are very, very bad.

## Is There Hope?

The good news is that there are some easier games on the schedule for
the Dolphins, including two against the Jets and a Week 16 matchup
against the Bengals at home. But based on current form, they should be
underdogs in every game, [according to
Inpredictable](http://stats.inpredictable.com/rankings/nfl.php), which
tracks lines. The best bets for a win are the Jets and Bengals home
games, in which Miami could be 4-point underdogs.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The preponderance of the evidence certainly points to the Dolphins being
the year’s worst team and perhaps the worst in a decade or more. If that
becomes the case, it might provide a glimmer of hope as the franchise
looks at how college football’s [Heisman race is shaping
up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/24/sports/ncaafootball/heisman-trophy-race-odds.html).

**Answer:** Sure. The [2020 N.F.L.
draft](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001071017/article/2020-nfl-draft-order-dolphins-no-1-at-midseason-giants-no-6)starts
on April 23.
