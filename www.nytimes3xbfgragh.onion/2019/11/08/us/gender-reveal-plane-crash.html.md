# ‘Gender Reveal’ Celebration in Texas Led to a Plane Crash

</div>

The aircraft stalled after dumping hundreds of gallons of pink water,
according to safety officials. It appears to be the latest in a growing
list of similar announcements gone wrong.

In recent years, expectant parents have gone to extreme lengths to
create splashy, Instagrammable moments to announce the sex of their
child. Some of the celebrations, however, have ended in calamity: a
45,000-acre forest fire, a flaming car, a deadly explosion.

And now, a plane crash could be added to that list, according to a
preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board filed
this week.

A crop-dusting plane that dumped hundreds of gallons of pink water over
a field in Turkey, Texas, about 300 miles northwest of Dallas, crashed
to the ground in early September, [according to safety board
documents](https://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/TOCPrint.cfm?docketID=62993&sort=0&order=1&searchTitle=&dorp=0).
No major injuries were reported.

The pilot, Raj Horan, had been “conducting a gender reveal flight for a
friend” when, after releasing about 350 gallons of water, the
single-seat plane “got too slow” and stalled, records show.

A passenger, identified as Jennifer Harrell, sustained minor injuries,
according to the incident report. The aircraft, which struck the ground
and flipped on its back, sustained substantial damage.

Attempts to reach Ms. Harrell and Mr. Horan on Friday afternoon were not
successful.

The pilot told investigators there were “no preimpact mechanical
failures or malfunctions with the airplane.”

Cultural researchers have traced the origins of the so-called gender
reveal [party to the
late 2000s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2019/11/01/us/ap-us-gender-reveal-explosions.html).
But those early attempts feel almost quaint by today’s standards.

Despite the possibility of attracting [backlash for reinforcing gender
stereotypes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/25/magazine/should-i-go-to-a-gender-reveal-party.html)
and [schadenfreude should things go
wrong](https://youtu.be/1LqOjDIJNZE), some couples have felt that
confetti or cake sprinkles are not flashy enough to deliver their
messages.

Last month, an Iowa couple trying to create a device that could shoot
colored powder into the air inadvertently built a pipe bomb that [killed
one of their
guests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/28/us/gender-reveal-party-death.html).
A day later, authorities in the state investigated another explosion of
a store-bought “gender reveal kit,” [according to The Associated
Press](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2019/11/01/us/ap-us-gender-reveal-explosions.html).

On Australia’s Gold Coast, [a black car was
rigged](https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/07/09/australia-gold-coast-brisbane-gender-reveal-burnout-accident-lon-orig.cnn)
to spew thick clouds of blue smoke. But after drifting slowly and
spinning its wheels on the road, the car burst into flames. (The driver
managed to escape.)

And in 2018, a man shot a rifle at a target containing a highly
explosive chemical mixed with colorful powder packets that were intended
to create a pink or blue cloud. The resulting explosion, however,
sparked a massive fire that took firefighters a week to extinguish and
[burned more than 45,000
acres](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/01/us/gender-reveal-arizona-fire.html)
in Arizona.

The man who shot the rifle, a Customs and Border Protection agent,
[pleaded
guilty](https://www.justice.gov/usao-az/pr/duty-border-patrol-agent-pleads-guilty-starting-2017-sawmill-fire-and-ordered-pay-more-8)
to a [misdemeanor violation of United States Forest Service
regulations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/01/us/gender-reveal-arizona-fire.html?module=inline)
and agreed to pay $220,000 in restitution.
