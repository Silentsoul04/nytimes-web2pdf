# How Ludwig Goransson Became Directors’ Secret Musical Weapon

</div>

The 35-year-old Swede has worked closely with Ryan Coogler and Donald
Glover. Up next: the score for the “Star Wars” series “The Mandalorian.”

The first few months of 2019 were huge for “Black Panther” and Donald
Glover. Ryan Coogler’s superhero movie [took home three
Oscars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/24/movies/oscars-academy-awards.html),
including the prize for best score. At the Grammys, where it won again,
Glover’s musical alter ego [Childish Gambino picked up four
trophies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/10/arts/music/grammy-awards.html)
for his ambitious political music video and song “This Is America.” Both
had something in common: a longhaired, lightly bearded Swedish musician
named Ludwig Goransson.

Goransson may not be a household name, but he’s a well-known face behind
the scenes. (His brief moment in the spotlight came when he accepted the
record of the year Grammy for “This Is America” and [thanked 21
Savage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9yvwLOAThw), who was absent in
ICE detention.) He did innovative soundtrack work for Coogler’s Rocky
film “Creed” as well as the director’s breakthrough, “Fruitvale
Station.” Goransson is currently at work on Christopher Nolan’s
“Tenet,” but his next major project arrives on Tuesday: He scored all
eight episodes of the Disney Plus “Star Wars” series, “The Mandalorian.”

<div class="css-1u3pw94">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The key to the modern-western sound of “The Mandalorian”? A flute theme
that Goransson came up with once Jon Favreau, the show’s creator, shared
his vision — which involved a lonesome rider and a samurai inspiration.
The series exists in “more of a dystopic part of the ‘Star Wars’
history,” Favreau said, “and technology and deconstruction are themes
that we explore.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With that in mind, Goransson locked himself in his studio for a month
and intuitively bought a bunch of rarely heard bass woodwind recorders.
He started improvising, going into an almost meditative state, he said,
creating a sprawling four hours of score that he spent the past year
writing and recording with top Hollywood studio musicians.

Goransson, 35, said he fell into his relationships with some of
Hollywood’s most exciting young talents by chance. He hit it off with
Coogler, a fellow student at the University of Southern California, in
2007 over a game of pool at a frat house when Coogler brought up his
favorite Swedish hip-hop artists.

“He was a football player, and he had really long dreads,” Goransson
said. “Maybe it’s because we come from different backgrounds that we
just have so much to talk about.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After graduating from [U.S.C.’s screen scoring
program](https://music.usc.edu/departments/scoring/), Goransson got his
first big gig as a composer for the NBC series “Community.” Glover, one
of the show’s stars, came to Goransson’s studio to record vocals for an
outrageous Irish-tango cover of the song “Somewhere Out There” from “An
American Tail.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We kind of laughed — we had a good time together,” said Goransson. “A
couple weeks later, he emailed me and was like, ‘Hey man, I’m also a
rapper, so I wondered if you could take a listen to this, and maybe mix
my song?’”

What drew Glover in? “I had the classical background and jazz
background,” Goransson said. “I could bring something different to the
table.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Goransson did not grow up in the hip-hop world, but music has been his
constant since he was “little Ludde” from Linkoping, Sweden. His mother,
a florist from Poland, and his father, a guitar teacher at the local
music school, filled the house with songs ranging from classical to rock
to Swedish folk.

He was named after Beethoven. (“My dad wanted to name me Albert after
Albert King, the big guitar blues player,” he said. “But my mom said,
‘No — Ludwig Beethoven.’”) And he’s always had long hair: “Everybody
thought he was this adorable little girl,” said his sister, Jessika,
“because he had the same hair that he has now. I have a bit of hair
envy.”

Goransson started playing guitar when he was 6, but his breakthrough
came three years later, when his father was learning Metallica’s “Enter
Sandman” at the request of his students. “He got obsessed,” his father,
Tomas, said in a phone interview. “He started to practice playing every
day for three or four hours.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Goransson spent most of his youth in his family’s basement, teaching
himself how to use a drum machine and a digital eight-track recorder,
and nurturing another fascination: soundtracks. He loved the music of
John Williams and Danny Elfman, and won the chance to have his work
performed by a professional orchestra as a senior in high school. He
wrote an Elfman-inspired piece called “Five Minutes to Christmas,” and
when he heard “a big classical orchestra play something that I’d
written,” he said, “I was like, Oh wow. This is something I want to do
for a living.”

He went to the Royal College of Music in Stockholm to major in jazz
guitar, but soon left for U.S.C., where he scored dozens of student
films. “They were all pretty bad,” he said, “but there was one of them
that was actually good” — Coogler’s short, “Locks,” a precursor to his
vérité-style debut, [“Fruitvale
Station,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/07/12/movies/fruitvale-station-is-based-on-the-story-of-oscar-grant-iii.html)
about the killing of a young black man by a white officer on a Oakland,
Calif., subway platform.

“It was always a collaboration that’s to be respected to the utmost, and
that respect is kind of compounded because we were friends first,”
Coogler said in an interview. “We’ve been close friends for so long that
we’re like family now.”

When Goransson got the job scoring “Black Panther,” Marvel’s 2018
juggernaut about the king of a fictional African nation and his
righteously angry cousin, he knew he had to go to Africa if he was going
to get it right. He recorded the talking-drum player Massamba Diop
playing a motif for T’Challa — the drum literally says the character’s
name — and the flutist Amadou Ba playing a theme on his Fula flute for
Erik Killmonger. He then fashioned a symphonic score with an African
heartbeat.

Goransson tries to give every film a sonic identity inherent to its
world. For “Fruitvale Station,” he used recordings of an actual BART
Station. On “Creed,” he sampled a boxing training session at Coogler’s
old gym in Oakland and converted those sounds into beats and rhythms for
the film’s fight sequences.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Tessa Thompson, who starred as the singer-songwriter Bianca in the
“Creed” movies, said she found her character by creating songs *as*
Bianca in Goransson’s studio.

“He has this real spirit of play, and so he can really experiment,” she
said. “He has a way of getting really close to the artists that he works
with, so they are really deep collaborations.”

Goransson briefly dabbled in making his own music (in 2012 he recorded
an EP as Ludovin), but realized he’s much more comfortable as a partner
than a star. In addition to his work with Childish Gambino, he’s
produced tracks for Chance the Rapper and the band Haim. For his
soundtracks, he’s produced and co-written with Future, Meek Mill and
Kendrick Lamar.

On the phone from Sweden, Goransson’s mother, Maria, recalled another of
his youthful obsessions — time. When he left for U.S.C., he made a
schedule for his career: get a job as an assistant one year after
graduation, be scoring his own projects after three years, win an
Academy Award within 12 years.

“Sometimes,” she said, “he’s much faster than what he planned.”
