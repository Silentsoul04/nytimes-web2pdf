One measure of artistic success is the ability to move the mainstream —
to bring once-unimaginable ideas to the widest possible audience. By
that metric, few people have been as successful as the musician [David
Byrne](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/david-byrne) and
the producer [David
Binder](https://www.bam.org/about/leadership/david-binder). Byrne, of
course, headlined the ’80s rock band [Talking
Heads](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/the-talking-heads),
which dissolved the barriers between disco and rock, conceptual art and
dance pop. Even before going solo in 1989, Byrne’s side projects
tentacled into disparate worlds: He collaborated with similarly
polymathic artists such as Brian Eno, Robert Wilson and [Twyla
Tharp](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/twyla-tharp); he
starred in the writer-director Jonathan Demme’s 1984 documentary “Stop
Making Sense”; and two years later, he directed the Robert
Altman-on-acid jukebox art film “True Stories.” In the ’90s and beyond,
Byrne used his fame to advance and collaborate with a wide range of
artists — the world-music acts on his label, [Luaka
Bop](https://luakabop.com/); the D.J. Fatboy Slim on “[Here Lies
Love](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/04/07/theater/david-byrnes-here-lies-love-about-imelda-marcos.html),”
their 2013 musical about [Imelda
Marcos](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/imelda-r-marcos);
the singer [St.
Vincent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/16/t-magazine/alex-da-corte-st-vincent.html)
on their joint 2012 album “Love This Giant.” His latest act of radical
pop is “American Utopia,” an album and touring rock show (which debuted
in 2018) that wears its theme lightly but seriously reimagines space:
Mobile musicians hop across a bare stage, dancing to their own music.
The work opened on Broadway last month and runs through Feb. 16.

It was inevitable that Byrne, now 67, would cross paths with the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, one of America’s most powerful arts
institutions. He wrote lyrics for the composer [Philip
Glass](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/philip-glass)’s
“The Photographer: Far From the Truth,” a mixed-media work about the
19th-century English photographer Eadweard Muybridge that premiered in
the United States at BAM’s inaugural Next Wave Festival in 1983. More
recently, in 2012, he designed the word-art-inspired bike racks in front
of its Peter Jay Sharp Building.

Last year, David Binder, 52, was
[hired](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/07/theater/broadway-producer-named-bams-new-artistic-director.html)
to succeed [Joseph
Melillo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/13/theater/next-wave-festival-joseph-melillo-brooklyn-academy-of-music.html)
as the artistic director of BAM. Like Byrne, Binder has always been
adept at bringing the cutting edge to the masses. Early in his career,
he helped turn John Cameron Mitchell’s crazy rock-opera idea into
“Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” eventually bringing it to Broadway in
2014. In 1998, he placed a bet on an Argentine troupe to make “De La
Guarda,” creating not only an Off Broadway money machine but a
contemporary template for immersive theater. These hits powered his dual
career as a festival guru and Broadway macher: Binder was a producer of
the 2007 High Line Festival (which raised funds to help develop New
York’s actual High Line) as well as the guest artistic director of
last year’s London International Festival of Theater. Meanwhile, he
played the Broadway celebrity game with savvy, casting [Sean
Combs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/sean-combs) to
draw crowds to 2004’s revival of “A Raisin in the Sun,” James Franco to
star in 2014’s “Of Mice and Men” revival and Adam Driver and Keri
Russell to headline this year’s revival of “[Burn
This](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/07/theater/adam-driver-keri-russell-burn-this-star-wars.html).”
One of Binder’s first moves at BAM was to reimagine the Next Wave
Festival, which this year replaces Byrne’s generation of mainstays
([Laurie
Anderson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/laurie-anderson),
[Meredith
Monk](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/04/arts/music/atlas-la-philharmonic-meredith-monk.html))
with a slate of artists never before seen on a BAM stage. Such an
evolution delighted Byrne when the two men met recently, sharing ideas
and anecdotes over breakfast at Morandi in New York’s West Village.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**David Binder:** I saw “[American
Utopia](https://americanutopiabroadway.com/)” last year at the Kings
Theater in Brooklyn, and I just thought it was one of the great rock
concerts. There isn’t a kind of existing language to define what it is —
it’s unclassifiable. You’ve talked about really using the empty space
...

**David Byrne:** Yeah, I imagined that it might be possible to have all
the musicians untethered. No mic stands, no platforms, no drums, no
monitor wedges, no water bottles even, which is a little tough on me,
but that’s fine. I realized that you could take contemporary dance and
mix it with pop, put it in front of an audience that has never seen a
contemporary dance performance in their life, and they love it.

**Binder:** That’s always the fun of it. That’s what I think is so
fantastic about it going to Broadway, because it allows you to knock
down all these conceptions: What is commercial? What’s a nonprofit work,
what’s an uptown work, what’s a downtown work? That is always the thing
about you — for 30 years. I have always loved doing that, too. But I was
thinking about the title: “American Utopia.” You’ve said it’s not irony;
it’s an imagining of what could be.

**Byrne:** That’s a pretty good summary.

**Binder:** There’s a kind of optimism in your work, which is not
something you traditionally associate with downtown artists of a certain
era. You say very optimistic things about the future but in tension with
very negative things. I think the audience is willing to go with you
because they ultimately walk away with not just darkness but some sense
of possibility.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**T:** But aren’t the things you’ve both made — pop music, Broadway
shows, art films — often aimed at different audiences?

**Byrne:** I don’t let the marketing drive the creative stuff, but I do
think at some point, “Oh, this is going to have a limited appeal, so
don’t get your hopes up.” We don’t always measure success by ticket
sales, but going on Broadway, the dream for me — and I don’t think it
will happen — is to eventually get an audience that’s never heard of me,
never heard of Talking Heads, but has heard this is a good show.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Binder:** That’s always my goal — to get the people who wouldn’t go
see a story of something like “Hedwig,” wouldn’t go see a character who
had a botched sex-change operation and a punk rock score. So, David, I
talked to the BAM archivists and I didn’t know this, but you were a
contributor to the very first Next Wave Festival, for “The
Photographer.” What was it like for you to work in that moment, before
BAM had the kind of fame it would have three or four years later?

**Byrne:** I knew Phil Glass and \[the director\] JoAnne Akalaitis from
[Mabou
Mines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/08/31/theater/31mabo.html),
the theater group \[founded in 1970\]. When I moved to New York in the
mid-70s \[having grown up mostly in Baltimore\], I started going to see
downtown theater, and it kind of blew my mind. Mabou Mines and the
Wooster Group and the experimental stage director Bob Wilson — I’d never
seen anything like it. And I thought, “Well, this is as exciting for me
as when I first heard rock ’n’ roll on a transistor radio as a kid.” A
door opens and you go, “Look at all this, it’s possible\!” I was just
thrilled.

**Binder:** I grew up in Los Angeles, and mostly I was exposed to
touring shows: chandelier-dropping, barricade-busting big Broadway
musicals via London. When I moved to New York in 1990, someone took me
to BAM — a really good friend. She taught a class, and she brought them
to the entire season of Next Wave: They had season tickets. And very
early on I saw John Adams’s 1991 opera “The Death of Klinghoffer” \[with
a book by Alice Goodman\]. I was actually working in [William Ivey
Long](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/01/29/magazine/william-ivey-long-keeps-his-clothes-on.html)’s
costume shop on \[[Stephen
Sondheim](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/16/t-magazine/lin-manuel-miranda-stephen-sondheim.html)
and John Weidman’s 1990 musical\] “Assassins,” and that was beyond my
wildest dreams. But going to BAM completely reshaped my aesthetic.

**Byrne:** Did you do some shows before “Hedwig”?

**Binder:** Right around the same time, I did “De La Guarda,” and David,
you were at the very first performance\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Byrne:** Could have been\! An Argentine musician friend of mine, his
wife was in the company. So I went with my daughter. They had these
bungee cords, they would come down and pick up a member of the audience
and lift them up. And my daughter was traumatized. She was really little
and she said, “My dad has been abducted by a man with a hairy butt\!”
\[*All laugh*\]

**Binder:** It was the most expensive Off Broadway show ever, and the
numbers made no sense. Everyone said it was for young people and young
people won’t come. It opened in June of ’98, and it lost money every
single week until November, and then it clicked. This was pre-social
media — now there’d be a way to talk about it. That didn’t exist. But I
remember that, on the very first day, I thought, “Maybe we’re not so
nuts because David Byrne is here. He knows what’s going on.”

**T:** Immersive theater can be a hard sell for critics, and some
artists, too.

**Byrne:** Maybe when I was younger, I might have been more like, “Just
let me watch.” But as I get older, I’m ready to jump in. I went to see
[Jackie Sibblies
Drury](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/04/10/t-magazine/jackie-sibblies-drury-play.html)’s
Off Broadway play “Fairview” last summer, and when it comes to the point
\[*spoiler alert*\] where the audience and the actors switch places,
nobody moved. So I thought, “I guess I gotta do it. I gotta be the first
one up there.”

**T:** You also dabbled in immersive theater in “[The Institute
Presents:
Neurosociety](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/04/arts/next-from-david-byrne-neuroscience-in-an-art-gallery.html),”
a 2016 exhibit in Silicon Valley that reframed scientific experiments as
a theatrical experience. That kind of thing seems increasingly popular.

**Byrne:** I think it’s more common as a kind of a marketing thing. And
it becomes an Instagram kind of thing. Some business writers in the ’90s
published a book called “The Experience Economy.” And they said it’s
really successful if they can get shoppers to pay to go shop, which is
kind of what Disneyland
does.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Binder:** At the Glastonbury Festival, there’s a group called Block9.
Since 2016, they’ve built this nightclub area that’s recreated a
warehouse in the meatpacking district circa 1982, but like exactly — and
to scale. They’re taking it back away from the marketing — making
extraordinary work. But David, you’ve done so many things. Do you think
there was a time when there were more artists who worked across genres?
What enabled people to do that?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Byrne:** I don’t know. The audience was sometimes really small, so
maybe the risk wasn’t so high. And the cost of living was cheaper. I
remember the early CBGB days when suddenly all these fine artists
decided they were going to be in bands, which brought a different
aesthetic to music-making. And then not too many years later, it went
totally the other way. Everybody who could was suddenly painting.

**Binder:** It’s interesting also that now \[in New York\], you have
\[multipurpose performance venues like\] the [Park Avenue
Armory](http://www.armoryonpark.org/) and [the
Shed](https://theshed.org/), but back then, BAM was the only place where
large-scale work by that whole community of artists could be presented.

**T:** But that was a relatively small community of young artists. How
do you nurture that now that BAM is a juggernaut?

**Binder:** I always want the work to have the widest possible audience.
Doing something like “Hedwig” on Broadway, the only thing commercial
about it was that it succeeded. I feel like those kinds of boundaries
and categories are all falling down, and things that are at the
intersection of multiple genres are, of course, BAM’s bread and butter.
But the idea of the Next Wave Festival this season is to go back to
\[the longtime BAM president\] Harvey Lichtenstein and Joe Melillo’s
original intention. So every single artist in the Next Wave Festival is
brand-new to BAM.

**Byrne:** It’s about time. It’s exciting. There’s a good chance
everything won’t be for everyone. But there are places that have
cultivated an audience who will go to see something they’ve never heard
of. And that can take a little while, but then once you build up that
trust, they’ll see almost whatever you put on.

**Binder:** We will eventually reintroduce some of the more legacy BAM
artists into Next Wave, but we’re going to try new folks for a couple of
years. The things we’re looking for could probably not be done anywhere
else in the city. Like this show, “What if They Went to Moscow?” by
Christiane Jatahy. Half the audience goes into BAM Rose Cinemas and half
goes into the Fisher theater, and in the Fisher, they see a play
inspired by Chekhov’s “Three Sisters,” which is filmed with multiple
cameras and screened live in the cinema. And then the audiences switch
places. I’m also interested in site-specific work. New York
organizations tend not to want to get out of the buildings. So we’re
going to try that this fall,
too.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Byrne:** So, how do you find the shows? Do you spend months going to
Edinburgh Fringe and various festivals?

**Binder:** I think that Joe Melillo is superhuman. He’d be like, “Oh
it’s Tuesday, I’m going to Paris. I’ll be back on Thursday.” I’m not
built that way. I tend to go in bigger groupings. So, this Wednesday,
I’m going to Zurich, Hamburg, the Netherlands, Edinburgh, Amsterdam
and London in nine days. And then that will be it for about a month. But
I always feel like the New York audience does feel idiosyncratic. Just
because the show is working in those cities, I don’t necessarily think
it would here. David, how were the audiences different with “American
Utopia?”

**Byrne:** It’s pretty consistent, but occasionally we’d get surprised.
In Santiago, Chile, we did a festival, and I don’t think this happened
anywhere else: A large portion of the audience copied the choreography.
So if we did some gesture, they would all start doing it back to us —
hundreds of people. I’m going to guess it’s because Santiago has this
tradition of mass movements. A number of years ago, they had these huge
street protests. They were like performances. There was one where the
entire group did the dance from [Michael
Jackson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/michael-jackson)’s
“Thriller.”

**Binder:** That’s how I learned to produce. Seriously\! Doing street
demonstrations and actions in Act Up. One time, Broadway Cares/Equity
Fights AIDS hired me to produce this action about Guantánamo Bay \[where
the United States quarantined Haitian refugees with H.I.V. in 1993\]. We
staged this giant thing in Rockefeller Center, with a Statue of Liberty
wrapped up in chains. Jonathan Demme was there, and I remember having
this conversation with him. He was like, “I don’t know if I should get
arrested.” He’s trying to work it out with me and I’m, like, 25. And he
decided he would, so he did.

**T:** That’s collaboration\! “American Utopia” is also, in a sense,
about the utopian world of collaboration. That seems to define both of
your careers. Does it also help keep the work fresh?

**Byrne:** Oh yeah. It pushes me out of my comfort zone, the things I do
by habit. I know that there are some artists who feel that collaboration
betrays their vision as an artist. There are some who feel like, “My
personal vision is sacred. I don’t want to dilute it.” I find that to be
riskier — you have this danger of falling into the trap of only being
inside yourself.
