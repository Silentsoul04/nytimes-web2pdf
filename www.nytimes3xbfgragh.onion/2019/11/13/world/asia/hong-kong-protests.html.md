HONG KONG — What started in June with [peaceful
rallies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/09/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-protest.html)
in opposition to [contentious
legislation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/10/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-bill.html)
has devolved into a steady stream of mayhem, with some protesters
embracing violent behaviors in response to [brutal police
tactics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/22/world/hong-kong-police-protests.html).

The protesters and the [Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/world/asia/hong-kong-purple-flag.html)
government, backed by Beijing, appear to have intractable differences,
and there have been few signs of either side backing down.

In the months since the demonstrations began, the unpopular bill, which
would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, has been withdrawn,
but the protesters’ demands have expanded to include increased democracy
and an investigation of the police.

The standoff has taken on international importance. China has viewed the
protests as a challenge to its fervent nationalism, while democracy
supporters worldwide have [cheered what they see as a poke in the
eye](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/03/world/asia/hong-kong-protesters-call-for-us-help-china-sees-a-conspiracy.html)
of the autocratic Chinese government. It all comes amid a rancorous
trade war between China and the United States, and some international
businesses, [including the
N.B.A.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/07/sports/basketball/nba-china-hong-kong.html),
have found themselves stuck in a political mess they wanted no part of.

Here’s a guide to how we got here, and why violence on both sides has
escalated.

## What is Hong Kong’s relationship with China?

[Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-fight-legco.html),
an international finance hub on China’s southern coast with more than
seven million residents, was a British colony until 1997, when it was
handed back to China under a policy known as [one country, two
systems](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/09/30/world/asia/the-hong-kong-protests-what-you-should-know.html?module=inline).

The policy made Hong Kong part of China but let it keep many liberties
denied to citizens on the mainland, including free speech, unrestricted
internet access and the right to free assembly. The territory has its
own laws, system of government and police force under a
mini-constitution known as the Basic Law. [China promised that this
system would remain in
place](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/01/world/asia/hong-kong-china-handover.html?module=inline)
until at least 2047.

But many Hong Kongers feel that Beijing is already [chipping away at the
city’s
autonomy](https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/06/11/beijings-white-paper-sets-off-a-firestorm-in-hong-kong/),
and that the local government does its bidding. The territory’s top
leader, the chief executive — currently Carrie Lam — is appointed by a
pro-Beijing committee.

## What do protesters want?

Many people in the territory feel deep contempt for the Chinese
government, and hope to preserve their freedoms for as long as possible.
At its core, the movement is aimed at resisting encroachment from the
mainland — but it has been complicated by rising violence.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At first, the movement was focused on a bill, [since
scrapped](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/04/world/asia/hong-kong-carrie-lam-protests.html),
that would have allowed people accused of crimes to be sent to places
with which Hong Kong had no extradition treaty — [including mainland
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/07/world/asia/hong-kong-china-extradition-protest.html?searchResultPosition=8&module=inline),
where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party. Hundreds of
thousands of people, fearing the bill would allow Beijing to target
dissidents in Hong Kong with phony charges, joined [a peaceful
march](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/09/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-protest.html)
to oppose the bill on June 9.

[On
June 12](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/world/asia/100000006602584/hong-kong-police-protest-video-investigation.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fbarbara-marcolini&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=9&pgtype=collection),
for the first time, the police used pepper spray, batons and more than
150 canisters of tear gas to [disperse thousands of
protesters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/12/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-protest.html?searchResultPosition=8&module=inline),
a small number of whom had thrown projectiles at the police. Irate at
the police response, protesters demanded an independent investigation of
the police force — a demand leaders have refused.

While [anger at the
police](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/world/asia/100000006702862/hong-kong-protests-police-officers.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fbarbara-marcolini)
has been a driving force, protesters have extended their demands to
include amnesty for arrested participants and direct elections for all
lawmakers and the chief executive. The movement is largely leaderless,
with decisions frequently made through [voting in online
forums](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/06/28/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html).

## Six Months of Hong Kong Protests. How Did We Get Here?

The protests started as peaceful marches and rallies against an
unpopular bill. Then came dozens of rounds of tear gas and a government
that refused to back down.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Why have the demonstrations turned violent?

A vast majority of participants have been nonviolent, staging strikes,
surrounding police stations, [shutting down the
airport](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/12/world/asia/hong-kong-airport-protest.html?module=inline)
and forming huge marches. The city’s creative class has turned protest
into
[art](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/11/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-art.html?module=inline)
and
[song](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/12/world/asia/glory-to-hong-kong-anthem.html?module=inline).

But a minority of protesters has become increasingly destructive, hoping
to force the government’s hand. Since only one of the protesters’
demands has been met — the withdrawal of the extradition bill — the more
violent participants felt peaceful rallies were ineffective.

Some protesters have thrown bricks and Molotov cocktails, and in one
case [stabbed a police
officer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/13/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-face-masks.html?module=inline).
The police say that one homemade bomb [was detonated during a
protest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/world/asia/hong-kong-bomb-ied.html?module=inline).
On several occasions, protesters have doled out vigilante justice,
beating people who were perceived to be against their movement,
including one man who was [doused with fluid and set on
fire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/11/world/hong-kong-protests.html).
A firebrand pro-Beijing lawmaker, Junius Ho, was [attacked with a
knife](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/05/world/asia/junius-ho-stabbed-hong-kong.html).
There has been considerable property damage to the train system, which
protesters have accused of supporting the police, and businesses seen as
pro-China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Protesters say the violence is in defense of excessively violent police
tactics. Officers have liberally deployed tear gas in ways that defy
international standards, including firing canisters from a height and
using it in enclosed spaces. Several protesters have been [shot with
live
rounds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/10/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-general-strike.html).
Cannons shooting water laced with a corrosive blue dye have become a
routine presence at protests. Individual interactions with the police
that are captured on video, such as the use of pepper spray against a
pregnant woman and an officer on a motorcycle [swerving into
protesters](https://t.me/stuckwithyou/4553), have infuriated
demonstrators.

Passions were further inflamed in November when [a Hong Kong student
died](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/07/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-student-dies.html)
after falling from a parking garage near demonstrations, possibly the
first death of the movement. The exact circumstances surrounding his
death remain unknown.

[Standoffs on university
campuses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/11/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-shooting.html)
have resembled trench warfare, with officers firing tear gas and
protesters attacking the police with firebombs, arrows and other
projectiles. [A standoff at Hong Kong Polytechnic University in
November](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/17/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-chinese-soldiers.html)
went on for days, with protesters trapped as the police laid siege to
the campus. A police officer was hit in the leg with an arrow, while
dozens of protesters were injured or suffered from hypothermia after
being hit by a water cannon.

## How does it end?

No one knows.

But despite some domestic propaganda showing [tanks assembling across
the
border](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/19/world/asia/hong-kong-china-troops.html)
in Beijing, it appears China is trying to avoid a Tiananmen-style
crackdown. Though the Chinese military has a garrison in Hong Kong, the
international business community would most likely see a military
intervention as the end of “one country, two systems,” and an exodus of
businesses could soon follow.

Still, China does not want to bend to the protesters, whom the state
news media have depicted as lawless, spoiled separatists. (Most
protesters say they are uninterested in independence.)

The Hong Kong government and the police have done little to calm
tensions, repeatedly denouncing the protesters while mostly defending
the police’s conduct. And protesters have shown few signs of fatigue,
despite thousands of arrests.
