# Tua Tagovailoa Was Injured Again. Should He Have Been Playing?

</div>

The Alabama quarterback and top N.F.L. prospect was carted off the field
with a hip injury against Mississippi State. His team was up big at the
time.

The lasting image of Tua Tagovailoa in an Alabama uniform may be this:
his face bleeding, his body curled up on the cart that carried him off
the field after an injury left him in excruciating pain.

That was the scene on Saturday in Starkville, Miss., after Tagovailoa,
the star Alabama quarterback, crumpled to the turf after two Mississippi
State players chased him down late in the first half of a 38-7 Crimson
Tide victory.

A towel over his head muffled his screams from a dislocated hip, which
will end his season, likely providing one bookend moment to a sterling
college career. The other came two years ago when he came off the bench
as a freshman at halftime of the national championship game and carried
Alabama to a thrilling comeback win over Georgia with an audacious
walk-off touchdown pass.

The Alabama team doctor, Lyle Cain, said in a statement Saturday night
that further tests would guide the treatment, but that Tagovailoa should
make a full recovery. But the injury was serious enough that Tagovailoa
was transported to a Birmingham hospital by
helicopter.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Afterward, Coach
Nick Saban told reporters: “Godspeed to him and his entire family, and
our thoughts and prayers are with him and hope this isn’t so serious
that it has any long-term effect on his future as a player.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And there is the crux of the conversation: What of Tagovailoa’s future?

He might have been the top pick in the N.F.L. draft, an athletic
left-hander with impeccable accuracy, a strong arm and consistently
astute decisions. Tying those qualities together was a magnetic presence
— part toughness, part charm — that could make him a franchise
quarterback.

But as the severity of Tagovailoa’s injury becomes
clear,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the questions will turn
to why Tagovailoa was playing at all.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is a calculus that is increasingly necessary these days in college,
where money rains on everyone but the players. Tagovailoa underwent
ankle surgery last month and seemed primed to sign a pro contract in
April with at least $25 million guaranteed.

If Tagovailoa, a junior who could choose to return next year, had been
playing in the N.F.L., he would at least have been compensated for the
games he was playing. And he also would have an agent, who might have
ensured that Tagovailoa received an independent opinion from doctors
about his ankle injury, and an evaluation of his recovery from the
related surgery from trainers who weren’t on a team’s payroll.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But who was advising Tagovailoa on whether to play?

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The [cutting-edge ankle
surgery](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/09/sports/ncaafootball/tua-tagovailoa-alabama-lsu.html)
he received was designed in part to speed up his recovery from a
sprained right ankle. Tagovailoa had the same surgery last year on his
other ankle and returned three weeks later with an outstanding playoff
semifinal performance over Oklahoma.

Even before his recent surgery, Tagovailoa told teammates that he would
be back against Louisiana State, a battle between unbeaten teams, the
winner all but assuring itself one of the four College Football Playoff
spots.

Indeed he returned, though Tagovailoa shied away from running with the
ball and played with a slight limp as the game wore on. And the limited
practiced seemed to show: He lost a fumble, threw an interception and
couldn’t bring Alabama all the way back in a 46-41 loss.

Afterward, Saban called him a warrior.

A similar scenario played out this week. Backup Mac Jones got most of
the work in practice, and leading up to game time there was uncertainty
over whether Tagovailoa would start. But there he was in the lineup, and
by the time he was injured, just before halftime, he had Alabama well
ahead.

Saban, who said he largely left the decision to play against L.S.U. up
to Tagovailoa, called Saturday’s injury a freak occurrence and said
Tagovailoa moved well in a pregame workout, perhaps better than he had
the week before.

“We can second-guess ourselves all we want,” Saban said.

There will be plenty of that. Saban can earn $800,000 in bonuses [if
Alabama wins the national
championship](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/12/sports/ncaafootball/alabama-cfp.html).
There is no such incentive for Tagovailoa. Or any of college football’s
stars. Ohio State defensive lineman Nick Bosa had abdominal surgery in
September 2018 and prepared for the draft rather than try to return to
the Buckeyes. Other players who are top N.F.L. prospects now routinely
skip bowl games that are not part of the playoff.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Saban was asked ahead of the L.S.U. game how much he considers a
player’s pro earning potential when deciding whether to play him after
an injury.

“I guess the question would be did they create value for themselves by
being great competitors?” Saban said then. “Always making choices and
decisions that were best for their team? Always making choices and
decisions that were best for themselves in terms of what they could do
to contribute value to their team? People still value guys that want to
always make the right decision about what they do.”

Perhaps they do. But the right decision for Saban may not have been the
right one for his quarterback, who wanted to play on Saturday but now
faces an uncertain tomorrow.
