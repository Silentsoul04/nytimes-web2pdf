LOS ANGELES — Every three decades, or roughly once a generation,
Hollywood experiences a seismic shift. The transition from silent films
to talkies in the 1920s. The rise of broadcast television in the 1950s.
The raucous “I Want My MTV” cable boom of the 1980s.

It is happening again. The long-promised streaming revolution — the next
great leap in how the world gets its entertainment — is finally here.

Streaming services, of course, have been challenging the Hollywood
status quo for years. Netflix began streaming movies and television
shows in 2007 and has grown into a giant, spending $12 billion on
programming this year to entertain more than 158 million subscribers
worldwide. There are 271 online video services available in the United
States, according to the research firm Parks Associates, one for
seemingly every predilection — [Pongalo](https://pongalo.com/) for
telenovelas, [AeroCinema](https://aerocinema.com/) for aviation
documentaries, [Shudder](https://www.shudder.com/) for horror movies,
[Horse Lifestyle](https://horselifestyle.tv/en) for equine-themed
content. (Offerings include a series called “Marvin the Tap Dancing
Horse.”)

While all this was happening, however, the three biggest old-line media
companies — Disney, NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia — largely stayed on the
sidelines. Charging into the streaming fray would mean putting billions
of dollars in profit from existing cable networks like USA, Disney
Channel and TBS at risk. Building video platforms of the size needed to
compete with Netflix and Amazon would be frightfully expensive. And
mastering the underlying technology would require a [sharp learning
curve](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/22/business/media/disney-struggling-to-find-its-digital-footing-overhauls-disneycom.html).
Better to bide their time. When it became clear that protecting their
existing business model was more perilous than embracing the future, no
matter now disruptive in the near term, they would act.

“I get asked all the time, ‘Where does this stop? *When does it stop*?’”
said Brett Sappington, a senior Parks Associates analyst and researcher.
“The truth is that it is only getting started.”

Disney Plus arrived on Tuesday and costs less ($6.99 a month) than a
single tub of popcorn at big-city movie theaters. It allows anyone with
a high-speed internet connection to instantly watch Disney, Pixar, “Star
Wars” and Marvel movies, along with [original series and
films](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/07/arts/television/disney-plus-togo-noelle-lady-and-tramp.html),
30 seasons of “The Simpsons” and 7,500 episodes of old Disney-branded TV
shows. “We’re all in,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said in
April at an [event unveiling the
service](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/11/business/media/disney-plus-streaming.html).

Disney said on Wednesday that more than 10 million people had already
signed up for the service. Analysts had been hoping for eight million by
the end of the year.

In May, WarnerMedia will introduce HBO Max ($14.99 a month), which will
offer 10,000 hours of instant entertainment, including the entirety of
“Friends” and “South Park,” hundreds of Warner Bros. movies,
everything Batman, the HBO library, 50 years’ worth of “Sesame Street”
episodes, and CNN documentaries. “We’re all in,” John Stankey,
WarnerMedia’s chief executive, said at an [HBO Max promotional
event](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/29/business/media/hbo-max-price.html)
on Oct.
29.

[Peacock](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/17/business/media/peacock-nbcuniversal-streaming.html),
an NBCUniversal streaming service also scheduled for a spring debut,
will offer *15,000 hours of content*: complete seasons of “The Office”
and “Frasier,” Universal films like “The Fast and the Furious” and
“Despicable Me,” Telemundo shows, every episode of “Saturday Night
Live,” a new reboot of “Battlestar Galactica.” Peacock, unlike Disney
Plus and HBO Max, will carry advertising. NBCUniversal is expected to
disclose pricing details (and presumably declare that it is “all in”) at
an event of its own in the coming months.

As the Big Three entertainment companies launch their video platforms,
streaming competition is mounting from Silicon Valley. Apple rolled out
[Apple TV
Plus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/11/business/media/apple-tv-plus-price.html)
on
[Nov. 1](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/30/business/media/apple-tv-plus.html).
Facebook and Snapchat are determined to become bigger video forces. And
never count out YouTube, part of the Google family. Feeling the need for
more “quick bite” videos while standing in line at the grocery store?
[Quibi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/07/business/media/quibi-espn-katzenberg.html),
a streaming start-up led by Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg, is due
in April.

The onslaught is upending how Hollywood does business in almost every
way.

Instead of relying exclusively on middlemen (cable system operators,
multiplex chains) to get shows and movies to viewers, traditional
entertainment companies are for the first time selling content directly
to consumers. As a result, studios are releasing fewer films in
theaters; WarnerMedia said recently that “Superintelligence,” a Melissa
McCarthy comedy scheduled for theatrical release in December, would
instead debut in the spring — [directly on HBO
Max](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/10/17/melissa-mccarthy-superintelligence-hbo-max-warner-bros-adam-sandler-netflix-kevin-hart-andy-serkis/#18ba41f0321c).

With more original movies bypassing big screens, the line between TV and
film is
[blurring](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/entertainment/streaming-wars-column/index.html),
prompting once-unthinkable operating questions. Studios, for instance,
employ separate executive teams to oversee the development and
production of movies and television series. Should that siloed approach
end?

There has even been some muttering about whether the [Emmys and the
Oscars should
merge](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/as-lines-between-film-tv-blur-academies-should-merge-1222139).

So much change is suddenly happening so quickly that viewers are
becoming overwhelmed and, studies suggest, not in a good way. For some
people, the cable bundle is starting to seem downright manageable in
comparison.

“Consumers are upset about the imminent changes in the media landscape,”
consumer behavior researchers at the Langston Company, a Colorado
consultancy, [concluded in a September
report](https://thelangstonco.com/langston-streaming-study). “These
negative feelings are driven by fears of fragmentation, erosion of
perceived value and the friction-cost of having multiple streaming
accounts.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nearly 50 percent of consumers are frustrated by the growing number of
subscription services required to see the content they want to watch,
according to [an August white
paper](https://www.fluentco.com/resources/streaming-services-whitepaper/)
by Fluent, a digital marketing company.

Without question, analysts say, the flood of new streaming services will
cause more people to cancel traditional cable subscriptions. Cable
television is still the entertainment industry’s cash cow, but millions
of customers in the United States have already cut the cord. The annual
pace of subscriber decline hit 5.4 percent in the second quarter, a
statistic Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at MoffettNathanson, referred
to in a recent report as “freaking ugly.”

For traditional companies like Disney and NBCUniversal, each of which
run vast cable networks, that means reduced ad sales and harder
negotiations with distributors over fees. “All signs point to subscriber
losses continuing to accelerate,” Richard Greenfield, a founder of the
LightShed Partners research firm, wrote in a client note. “Virtually
every ambitious, must-see TV show is headed for a direct-to-consumer
platform, with TV/basic cable taking the proverbial
leftovers.”

Big cable channels like ESPN, Fox News, Bravo and HGTV aren’t going
anywhere, but channels that are already poorly rated — BabyFirst,
Ovation,
[Viceland](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/29/arts/television/viceland-a-new-cable-channel-aims-to-stand-out.html?searchResultPosition=1)
— will have a harder time staying in business, analysts say. The culling
of the herd has already started, with cable outlets like Cloo, Esquire,
Pivot and Al Jazeera America calling it quits in recent years. Glenn
Beck will [pull the
plug](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/glenn-becks-blaze-end-linear-tv-1252902)
on his Blaze cable channel next month.

Even so, some of the biggest changes involve talent.

Netflix and other tech companies, including Apple and Amazon, have been
[steadily poaching
writer-producers](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-et-netflix-job-report/)
from established studios and television networks by offering eye-popping
pay packages. Kenya Barris (“black-ish”), Ryan Murphy (“American Horror
Story”), Shonda Rhimes (“Grey’s Anatomy”) and David Benioff and D.B.
Weiss (“Game of Thrones”) have all high-tailed it to Netflix, following
stars like Adam Sandler and David Letterman. The establishment has
recently been punching back. To keep Greg Berlanti, the TV whiz behind
shows like “The Flash” and “Riverdale,” Warner Bros. dug [deep into its
pockets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/07/business/media/greg-berlanti-warner-bros.html).
Warner completed a [similar
deal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/17/business/media/jj-abrams-warnermedia.html)
with J.J. Abrams in September.

“There is money being thrown at people and ideas and scripts at a level
that has never happened before in Hollywood,” said Mr. Sappington, the
Parks Associates analyst.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even Netflix is starting to experience sticker shock. Ted Sarandos, the
company’s chief content officer, told analysts on an October conference
call that new bidders were driving up prices for “elite” content. “On a
very competitive show, there has probably been 30 percent price
escalation since last year,” Mr. Sarandos said.

Most definitely, streaming money is sloshing through the Hollywood
economy. Producers in backwaters like children’s television are [now in
hot
demand](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/11/business/media/netflix-children-movies-streaming.html).
Midlevel publicists are driving new luxury cars. Florists, caterers, set
decorators, chauffeurs, hair stylists, headhunters — it’s gravy train
time.

But fewer Hollywood people are turning cartwheels than outsiders might
think. To keep their content assembly lines speeding ([495 scripted
original
series](https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/just-shy-of-500-scripted-originals-says-fx-survey)
aired in 2018, an 85 percent increase from 2011) companies are
stretching some employees to a breaking point. Because streaming
services order fewer episodes and cancel series after shorter runs,
rank-and-file writers are having to switch jobs more frequently.

There is also a [fundamental shift with employment
contracts](https://deadline.com/2019/07/hollywood-profit-participation-tv-deals-changes-disney-streaming-services-1202641423/)
underway. Disney, for instance, has adopted new terms for TV shows.
Under the old model, in place for decades, show creators were paid
handsome fees from the beginning. But the big money came in success: a
slice of profits from rerun sales. Disney, following a [model
popularized by
Netflix](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-war-for-talent-in-the-age-of-netflix-11569038435),
now offers higher upfront payments but little or no “back end.” Other
traditional companies are doing the same; they say it allows for
distribution flexibility inside their corporate ecosystems (broadcast,
cable,
streaming).

The shift has rankled members of the Writers Guild of America, which
represents about 13,000 screenwriters and has been whispering about a
potential strike. The W.G.A.’s contract with studios expires on May 1.
Studio contracts with two additional Hollywood unions, SAG-AFTRA
(actors) and the Directors Guild of America, expire on June 30.

Courtney Kemp, creator of the Starz drama “Power,” campaigned on the
topic during September elections for the writers’ guild’s West Coast
board. “The companies are looking actively to ‘buy us out’ up front, so
they don’t have to share profits with us, and they don’t have to pay us
for reuse — and they will never have to tell us the truth about the
value of our content,” Ms. Kemp wrote in her campaign statement.

that’s an issue worth striking over.”
