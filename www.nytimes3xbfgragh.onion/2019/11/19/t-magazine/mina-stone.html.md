# How to Throw a Romantic Greek Dinner Party

The chef Mina Stone opened a casual Greek restaurant at MoMA PS1 in
Queens last week and celebrated the occasion at an artist’s studio in
Brooklyn.

On a recent fall evening in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the sky was shifting
colors quickly, from blue-gray to violet, and then swiftly, it was dark.
Assembled in the verdant courtyard of the artist [Cassandra
MacLeod](http://cassandramacleod.com/)’s studio were the friends of the
chef [Mina
Stone](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/01/30/t-magazine/mina-stone-cooking-for-artists-recipe.html),
who last week opened her Mediterranean-inspired restaurant
[Mina’s](http://www.minas.nyc/) **** at MoMA PS1 with her husband,
Alex Eagleton. Open bottles of natural Greek wines from the specialty
Greek importer Eklektikon sat in an ice bath on a circular wooden table,
alongside sliced cheese, apples and dried figs. Stone had been hard at
work at MacLeod’s studio all week, cooking and photographing dishes for
her second cookbook. Her first, “[Cooking
for](https://www.artbook.com/9780984721078.html)**[](https://www.artbook.com/9780984721078.html)**[Artists](https://www.artbook.com/9780984721078.html)”
(2015), was about her experience working with the art dealer Gavin
Brown, at whose gallery and home she cooked large dinners after
openings, as well as working with the artist Urs Fischer, for whom she
prepared studio lunches.

Cooking was also how Stone fell in love. Eagleton, like Stone, is Greek,
and when the two first met, they agreed they could never find the kind
of Greek food they knew and loved. They got together to cook the dishes
they liked to eat with their families. It was innocent, or at least to
Eagleton. “Let’s just say that one of us was the fish, and one of us was
the fisherman,” he jokes. “I was the fisherman\!” Stone adds with a
laugh.

Kate Fowle; the writer [Nick McDonell](http://www.nickmcdonell.com/);
and other longtime friends such as the cook and author Julia Sherman and
the curator and producer Eliza Ryan. Eagleton placed — not so
surreptitiously — bottles of ouzo and mezcal on the table to coax the
night along, and guests lingered on the studio’s balcony until late, as
MacLeod’s black cat, Pineapple, slinked around the shadows. Below, a
guide to how to throw a casual but artistic Mediterranean-inspired
dinner like
Stone’s.

### <span>Fresh Ingredients Can Be Transporting</span>

Greece is a huge influence on Stone. She and Eagleton spend much of
their summers on Paros, an island in the Cyclades so famous for its
chickpeas that it holds a festival celebrating the humble legume every
July. Stone’s mother’s side of the family is from Pireas, a port city
**** on the mainland, and Eagelton was born and raised nearby in Athens.
**** The **** Greek food they cherish is deceptively simple, in part
because the ingredients often are common but of the highest quality.
Stone likes to buy her olive oil, feta cheese, olives and yogurt at the
Greek specialty market [Titan Foods](https://www.titanfoods.net/) in
Queens. She prefers to use lemon juice to dress her dishes instead of
vinegar — “it adds a cleaner sensibility,” she says. Same goes for her
tzatziki, which she makes out of Fage yogurt, grated cucumber and garlic
and drizzles with some fresh lemon juice (for more sensitive types, she
recommends placing a peeled garlic clove in the tzatziki to let it
absorb some of its flavor, removing the clove before serving). Stone’s
vision is bound less by authenticity and more by the idea of serving an
experience that mirrors how Greek families eat together. Many items
she’s serving at Mina’s, like mezzethaki — essentially a shot of ouzo
with a snack, though Stone is serving the snacks separately from the
beverage — embrace the concept. She says: “I think it would be
appropriate to have a spot where you can get great Greek food and it
doesn’t serve just fish or gyros; it’s what you would get if you went to
a home in Greece, such as lentils or chickpeas or what is traditionally
seen as a kind of impoverished
cuisine.”

### <span>Serve Family-Style </span>

Dinner was served in two courses: First came the freshest Greek salad I
had ever tasted (the last of summer’s tomatoes, red onion, cucumbers,
mint, green pepper and oregano topped with barrel-aged feta imported
straight from Greece), a sesame-encrusted bread called koulouri, fresh
olives, melitzanosalata ** (an eggplant dip with lemon juice and
parsley) and tzatziki. Then arrived steamed broccoli rabe drizzled with
lemon juice, roasted beets with vinegar and braised chicken with lemon
and potatoes. Nearly all the ingredients were sourced from [Essex
Farm](https://www.essexonlakechamplain.com/essex-farm/), located in
upstate New York. There was a simple pleasure in eating the food in
front of you, bite after bite, until it was magically gone. Stone told
me of a Greek word, *papara*, which means ripping off a piece bread and
dipping it in the oil and tomato juice of the Greek salad or mopping up
the sauce from the pan for the chicken.

### <span>Let Your Food Tell a Story</span>

Stone likes to work with a baker named Savannah Turley **** and had
instructed her to “bake something sesame-y and seedy. If you want to
braid it or do anything beautiful, please do\!” So Turley began
researching Greek breads and decided on koulouri, a street bread
typically sold to people on the go in the morning. It is usually
drizzled with sesame seeds, but it can also be stuffed with cheese,
chocolate or tahini. It’s related to the Turkish bread simit (often
called the Turkish bagel), and several versions of the O-shaped street
food **** appear across the former Ottoman Empire. “This is one of the
many things I love about bread,” Turley adds. “It has such a history and
you learn so much about a culture by digging into their bread.” Stone’s
own style of serving — of preparing everything in advance as much of
possible — reminded me of the storytelling you find in the best kinds of
cookbooks. She says: “I was thinking the other day about how a lot of
Greek matriarchs get up at 8 in the morning, they make lunch, and it
sits around on the stove until it’s lunchtime, and it’s briefly heated
up and served and then paired with one other thing that you cut up at
that time, like the salad. To me, that is something I apply to
entertaining in my house. I like being able to have the thing that can
be made ahead of time, heated up, and then the thing that you make right
as you’re ready to
sit.”

### <span>Pair Complex Company With Low-Concept Dishes</span>

I’ve attended several of Stone’s dinners for Gavin Brown, and I remember
being struck by her comforting stews, rice, beans and salads — in short,
the unfussiness of it all. You often grabbed a bowl and stood in line
and she ladled the food onto your plate, which you ate on your knees,
sitting in a circle with other artists, curators and collectors. Stone’s
cookbook has become a kind of guide for me at home, not just as an
introduction to Greek food but also on how to cook for guests without
going over the top. Her very first Gavin Brown dinner was inspired by
the French art dealer Ambroise Vollard, who worked with artists such as
[Paul
Cézanne](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/paul-cezanne)
and [Pierre-Auguste
Renoir](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/pierre-auguste-renoir)
at the turn of the 20th century. “\[His dinners\] would be in his
basement, and it was at a time where this really wasn’t appropriate,”
**** says Stone. “He would always make curry, and it would be artists
and art dealers having dinner side by side, and that was the
inspiration. It was a happy accident.” Everything about Stone’s ethos is
geared toward **** creating an informal yet interesting atmosphere, one
where it feels like having a home-cooked meal with outstanding company —
just without being left to clean up the dirty dishes.

### <span>Dessert Can Be Decadent but Casual </span>

To finish the meal, **** Stone served **** something few guests had
tasted before, a kind of bread pudding called portokalopita that
involves taking shredded phyllo pastry and baking it with yogurt, eggs,
sugar, olive oil and orange rind. After it’s cooked, Stone pours an
orange syrup over it. It was like a bread pudding, but it was also sort
of like a sponge cake, and it was decadently delicious and utterly
surprising — the zest of the orange mixed with the sticky sweetness of
the sugar. Stone let dinner slowly settle with her guests, allowing
everyone to mingle, chat or smoke cigarettes outside. She
unceremoniously plopped down slices of portokalopita ** arranged in its
own baking tin with some parchment paper along with a platter of sliced
Fuji apples drizzled with mint and Greek honey (the bees feast on thyme
nectar, resulting in a surprising kick) and let guests serve themselves.
I ate mine, quickly, with my fingers. Soon, the dessert platters were
depleted.
