Home alone with infant twins, it's all a blur. But at night, the husband
comes home. He's cooking.

This year \href{http://michellebuteau.com}{Michelle Buteau} had a
breakout role in the Netflix movie
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHBcWHY9lN4}{Always Be My
Maybe''} and starred in the BET Plus television series,
``\href{https://www.bet.com/celebrities/news/2019/09/19/5-things-you-need-to-know-about--first-wives-club-.html}{The
First Wives Club,''} among other projects. She is also a co-host of the
WNYC podcast
``\href{https://www.npr.org/podcasts/725509261/adulting}{Adulting.}''

But the work that Ms. Buteau, 42, said inspires her to ``slow down and
taste the rosé'' is raising her infant twins, Otis and Hazel, born in
January of this year via surrogate.

Ms. Buteau and her husband, \href{https://gijsvandermost.com/About}{Gijs
van der Most}, 42, spent five years trying to conceive. That time was
``a lot of disappointment, a lot of money spent and a lot of tears
shed,'' she said. Now, she just feels overwhelmed, especially on
Sundays, she explained, when her nanny is off and her husband is working
at the couple's furniture store, \href{https://vandermostmodern.com}{Van
Der Most Modern}, in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

``But mine is a cute overwhelmed,'' she said. ``Not like a substitute
teacher overwhelmed.'' Ms. Buteau lives with her family and their Lab
Mastiff, Lola, on City Island, in the Bronx.

\textbf{IT'S A CYCLE} I get up anywhere between 4 and 6 a.m. I just
really enjoy a sunrise. No. No. It's the babies. I feed the babies. I
change the babies. Sunday isn't even a day anymore, it's a cycle. I'm
sleepwalking the whole time. But as long as I can't smell myself and you
can't smell me, we're O.K.

\textbf{STROLLER-FRIENDLY} We go for a walk out on this private beach
that's in our backyard that overlooks Long Island Sound. They're asleep
in the stroller. Then we go for a walk around the island. I'll pick up a
coffee or some sort of juice or whatever. I just go into whatever shop
can fit a double-wide stroller. I don't care if it's a tackle shop, as
long as I can fit.

\textbf{GRAZE} I feed them a bottle about 10 a.m., and they get some
solid food, like a chunky purée of banana. They don't have teeth. They
have hard gums. Actually, the little boy has two tiny teeth, like he's
out of a baby commercial. Then sometimes a friend will stop over and
help me so I can use the bathroom. I grab what I can to eat. Stuff I can
graze on, because sitting down with a knife and a fork just isn't
happening.

\textbf{KEEP IT CLASSY} The babies need a change of scenery. So
sometimes we'll sit up in the nursery with all their soft toys, and
sometimes we'll go downstairs where the playpen is. We'll do a lot of
singing and dancing. People are like, What are you listening to? The new
Cardi B? I'm like, no. ``Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes,'' honey. The
remix is stellar.

Sometimes there's some Amy Winehouse but the kids pick up on her energy
and they're like, this is sad, and I'm like, you're right. Then we throw
in a little Nina Simone, some James Brown, Otis Redding and Etta James.
We keep it classy. At some point I might even put a bra on.

\textbf{HOME SICK} I wish it was like, and then I go to the farmers'
market and figure out how to grow tomatoes. I wish it was super-soul
Sunday. But what I'm doing is I'm waiting for my husband to come home
with treats from Brooklyn. We miss Brooklyn. We lived in Bed-Stuy. I'm
half Haitian, half Jamaican. I love Caribbean food. He'll bring me
Haitian patties or jerk chicken and I'll graze on that. We'll have a
couple beers till the CBD oil kicks in. It's amazing. Will I ever
exercise? Who knows.

\textbf{GET IT DONE} The good thing about taking care of babies is that
now, when I have an hour to get stuff done, I will get it done. Before I
was like, I'll do it next hour. I was also more involved in the
furniture store. I've always been into interiors but in my 20s I didn't
know what I was doing and I didn't have a lot of money so it was always
a Pier 1 clearance situation. My husband is just sort of ``Rain Man''
when it comes to designers. He's from the Netherlands.

\textbf{MARRIAGE THERAPY} After what I call bed, bath and beyond, which
is putting the babies to bed, husband will cook some dinner. If he does
salmon, he makes sure the skin is crispy. If he does steak he'll do it
with a butter sauce. If he's making a salad he'll put three or four
different herbs in the dressing. That's how you stay married. He'll have
a \href{https://redstripebeer.com/our-beer/}{Red Stripe} and I'll have
the whole bottle of rosé because I earned it. It goes down like a
seltzer. Don't judge my journey.

\textbf{SAD SHOW, CLEAN SHEETS} We watch
``\href{https://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/90-day-fiance/}{90-Day Fiancé.''}
It's a great show about the government giving people three months to
decide how sad they're going to be. I take a shower before I go to bed,
because the sheets are clean. I'm out by 10:30.
