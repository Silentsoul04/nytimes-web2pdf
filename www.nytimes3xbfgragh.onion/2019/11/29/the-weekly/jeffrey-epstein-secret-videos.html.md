## The Hunt for Jeffrey Epstein’s Hidden Files

#### A mysterious man told us he had surveillance footage from Jeffrey Epstein’s properties. Then his story took a turn.

</div>

  -   
    \<i\>\[sparse dramatic music\]\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>DAVID: This
    story really began for us the day in July\</i\> \<i\>that Jeffrey
    Epstein was arrested\</i\> and criminally charged with sex
    trafficking of minors. ELLEN: Suddenly, he was someone we were
    thinking about. One of the big questions was where his money was
    from. \<i\>DAVID: This is a college dropout,\</i\> \<i\>a former
    high-school math teacher\</i\> \<i\>who had had scant Wall Street
    experience.\</i\> \<i\>How does someone like that\</i\> come up with
    hundreds of millions of dollars? \<i\>ELLEN: And we were tantalized
    by the fact that\</i\> he seemed to have influence with a lot of
    powerful people. \<i\>DAVID: And these weren’t models and Hollywood
    people.\</i\> These are some of the biggest names in business and
    finance. ELLEN: They were Nobel Prize winners, Wall Street bigwigs.
    DAVID: The list goes on and on. \<i\>And we wanted to figure out why
    people had gravitated to him\</i\> even after he had become known as
    a sexual predator. \<i\>ELLEN: And then in September, our reporters
    met a man\</i\> who claimed to have a secret trove of information
    \<i\>from Epstein’s properties.\</i\> \<i\>DAVID: This is someone
    who had extraordinary,\</i\> probably unparalleled inside access to
    not only Epstein, but Epstein’s digital archive. \<i\>ELLEN: If what
    the informant was saying was true,\</i\> it had the potential to
    unlock Jeffrey Epstein’s most important secrets. \<i\>\[dramatic
    music\]\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> - I think that this story is a window
    into how things work behind... the curtain of wealth and power. And
    to be honest, it’s a little bit about journalism, too. \<i\>\[sparse
    suspenseful music\]\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>I personally, or as a
    journalist,\</i\> \<i\>do not care who is sleeping with whom.\</i\>
    \<i\>That is not my business.\</i\> \<i\>But it is my business\</i\>
    \<i\>to understand what was going on with Jeffrey Epstein,\</i\>
    \<i\>and throughout all of the Epstein story,\</i\> \<i\>there was
    sort of the whiff of blackmail.\</i\> - And the people who were
    involved in this just refused to say anything, which—we’re
    journalists. There’s nothing that piques our curiosity more than a
    bunch of rich, powerful people saying, “There’s nothing to see
    here.” \<i\>So we started digging.\</i\> \<i\>ELLEN: We had a lot
    of reporters sort of working on these related stories,\</i\> and
    this sort of brought a bunch of them together. Jacob—you know, to be
    honest, I don’t remember how Jacob got involved. I don’t actually
    remember. - Originally, I wasn’t quite part of the team. You know, I
    work on the Styles desk, which we sometimes joke is the toy
    department of “The New York Times.” But I kind of couldn’t drop the
    story. \<i\>The cast of characters was too dark\</i\> \<i\>and, at
    the same time, too colorful and weird.\</i\> - But we wouldn’t be
    here without Jacob. \<i\>JACOB: I was looking into Jeffrey Epstein’s
    rise\</i\> \<i\>in the 1980s, and I called Stan Pottinger\</i\>
    because he was representing victims, and I figured that he might
    know or have heard some stuff along the way. \<i\>DAVID: Stan
    Pottinger is a former official\</i\> back in the Nixon and Ford
    presidential administrations. ANCHOR: He is a former assistant
    attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. \<i\>ELLEN: Was a
    longtime lawyer, famous for dating Gloria Steinem.\</i\> \<i\>He was
    sort of a man around town in New York.\</i\> - And generally quite
    well regarded. - You can trust the process. You should come forward
    and help see that justice is done. - Some of the questions that I
    was asking him— most, actually— he didn’t know about. So I hung up
    the phone, and a couple of hours later, he called me back and said,
    “I think maybe we should meet.” - Pottinger mentions something
    extremely juicy to Jacob, which is that— “We have an informant.”
    \<i\>JACOB: And he said, “I’m working with David Boies,\</i\> “and
    we have found this guy who we believe has access “to an enormous
    amount of information about Jeffrey Epstein.” \<i\>DAVID: At the
    time that we first heard from Pottinger\</i\> about this informant,
    he and David Boies were two of the most prominent lawyers
    representing alleged victims of Epstein. \[indistinct chatter\]
    \<i\>EMILY: David Boies is one of the most powerful lawyers\</i\>
    \<i\>in the country today.\</i\> For a while he was kind of lauded
    as the modern-day Atticus Finch. \<i\>DAVID: Litigating some of the
    country’s most famous cases,\</i\> \<i\>whether it’s Bush v. Gore or
    the Microsoft antitrust case\</i\> \<i\>or gay marriage before the
    Supreme Court.\</i\> - Marriage equality will be the law throughout
    this land. - And his reputation had been somewhat tarnished because
    he represented Harvey Weinstein. \<i\>DAVID: Boies helped Weinstein
    hire Black Cube—\</i\> \<i\>a firm that worked to manipulate\</i\>
    \<i\>Weinstein’s alleged victims and deceive reporters.\</i\>
    \<i\>The “Times” had worked with Bois’ firm in the past\</i\>
    \<i\>and fired them after learning about this.\</i\> \<i\>-
    B-O-I-E-S.\</i\> \<i\>EMILY: For David Boies, the Epstein saga\</i\>
    \<i\>provided him almost, like, a redemption tour.\</i\> And he’s
    really been out representing himself \<i\>as a huge advocate for sex
    abuse victims.\</i\> So he’s a really complicated character but also
    really considered almost like royalty in the American legal
    community. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>Jacob was setting up this meeting
    with the lawyers\</i\> \<i\>and the informant.\</i\> We planned to
    meet on Saturday morning on September 14th at the Boies Schiller law
    firm. \<i\>JACOB: We get there, and we are quickly told\</i\>
    \<i\>that we’re going to drop our phones and our laptops.\</i\>
    \<i\>EMILY: And then we walk in, and we met the informant.\</i\> I
    would describe him as this bear of a man. He’s probably, like, two
    or three times my size. - He wore a blue shirt, and he had
    flip-flops on. \<i\>EMILY: And the meeting is off the record,\</i\>
    so that means that we can’t talk about it now. \<i\>But we left
    feeling pretty excited.\</i\> \<i\>JACOB: The informant— he was
    compelling, actually.\</i\> There was a calmness about him that day
    that indicated that he wasn’t desperate. \<i\>EMILY: And so we walk
    up to “The New York Times” building,\</i\> and I get an email that
    says, “Are you free?” It’s from the informant. And right away I
    respond and say, “Yes,” period. And then he says, “Where can we
    meet?” \<i\>DAVID: The secret source is reaching out to us
    directly.\</i\> That is gold. It means that the source wants an
    unchaperoned setting. \<i\>JACOB: We quickly moved to a Chinese
    restaurant.\</i\> \<i\>In the middle of the day, it tends to be
    empty,\</i\> \<i\>and indeed it was.\</i\> To our right was a group
    of women who were snipping string beans. \<i\>EMILY: It’s, like,
    this giant mound in the middle of the table,\</i\> \<i\>and they’re
    just kind of snipping off the ends of these green beans.\</i\>
    \<i\>JACOB: But other than that, there was almost no one in the
    restaurant.\</i\> \[door bells jingle\] \<i\>He got there a few
    minutes after we did, and he sat down.\</i\> \<i\>He, you know, took
    off his messenger bag, and...\</i\> \<i\>he hadn’t gotten a
    pedicure, you know?\</i\> I mean, he’s a big guy. He looked the
    part. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>EMILY: One of the first things that he
    says is,\</i\> \<i\>“I don’t like lawyers.”\</i\> \<i\>And he’s
    really ready to have a real conversation.\</i\> \<i\>JACOB: We are
    told to call him Patrick Kessler.\</i\> \<i\>We are told that this
    is a pseudonym\</i\> \<i\>because he lives this clandestine
    life.\</i\> - What he also tells us is that he was one of the early
    creators of this messaging system that allowed people to send very
    encrypted, very secure messages, and that’s actually how he was
    connected to Jeffrey Epstein. \<i\>JACOB: He claimed to have gone to
    work for Epstein\</i\> \<i\>after Epstein got out of jail in
    2009,\</i\> \<i\>and he claimed that Epstein had a surveillance
    system.\</i\> - He says that Jeffrey Epstein wanted to use his
    system to store vast amounts of surveillance footage, \<i\>and he
    said Epstein had four cameras running in each of the bedrooms.\</i\>
    \<i\>JACOB: He said that the cameras were recording all the
    time—\</i\> in New York, in Palm Beach, in London. \<i\>EMILY: So
    there would be thousands upon thousands\</i\> \<i\>of hours of
    footage.\</i\> \<i\>And he pulled out his phone,\</i\> \<i\>and he
    started to kind of scroll through\</i\> \<i\>some different pictures
    that he said were stills\</i\> \<i\>from the video footage.\</i\>
    \<i\>There were images of people receiving oral sex.\</i\>
    \<i\>There were images of people having sex.\</i\> \<i\>And he said
    that within some of that video data\</i\> were powerful, prominent
    men abusing young women. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>But then he told us
    something else,\</i\> \<i\>and this was about the lawyers.\</i\>
    \<i\>JACOB: He said, “What do you think of David Boies?”\</i\> And
    then he began to kind of express reservations. \<i\>EMILY: What
    Patrick told us is that he had information\</i\> about a number of
    very powerful men but that the lawyers told him to stick to only
    two. - Because those were the only people that they wanted out at
    that time. - He thought that they were motivated by money.
    \<i\>JACOB: At the end of the meeting, the way that we left it\</i\>
    \<i\>was that he would keep talking to the lawyers,\</i\> but we
    would also talk to him separately. \<i\>DAVID: We had spent months
    thinking about,\</i\> “Was there a blackmail scheme that Epstein was
    using? Was there secret video surveillance?” And here we have a guy
    who comes more or less out of the woodwork and says not only was
    there, but, “I have it.” \<i\>JACOB: After we left the first
    meeting,\</i\> \<i\>I was certainly skeptical in some ways,\</i\>
    \<i\>but it was plausible\</i\> that hidden-camera systems would
    exist, you know? When the raid on Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion
    happened, \<i\>there were all these wires from the walls.\</i\>
    \<i\>It seemed like computers\</i\> \<i\>and perhaps cameras had
    been removed.\</i\> \<i\>EMILY: I’ve also been speaking with this
    woman named Maria Farmer,\</i\> \<i\>who said that she was abused by
    Jeffrey Epstein.\</i\> Maria said that Jeffrey took her to this room
    that she described kind of as a surveillance room that has a number
    of screens displaying what went on in his property. \<i\>He told her
    that he was using this\</i\> to keep track of everything that went
    on in his house, that he was keeping it in case he needed it
    someday. \<i\>JACOB: Jeffrey Epstein had also told “The New York
    Times”\</i\> that he had a lot of information about powerful people.
    \<i\>And so there was this implication, even from him,\</i\> that if
    you messed with him, he could damage you. \<i\>\[suspenseful
    music\]\</i\> \<i\>ELLEN: Of course, it sounds very salacious.\</i\>
    But the truth is, we were trying to answer a question, which was,
    “What did Jeffrey Epstein have on all these powerful, powerful,
    wealthy men?” \[phone dings\] \<i\>EMILY: So that Monday,\</i\>
    \<i\>Patrick says that there’s more that he wants to talk
    about\</i\> but that we need to talk in person. \<i\>DAVID: He had
    said he was going to be in Washington\</i\> and planned to have some
    meetings on Capitol Hill, and that just scared the shit out of us.
    \<i\>It was guaranteed to leak instantly.\</i\> \<i\>EMILY: Jacob
    and I kind of arranged to go to D.C.,\</i\> and we also pull in
    another reporter. - They ask him if they can introduce, like, a
    third person. - We just said, “You’ll like her. We feel you will
    like her.” And indeed he did. - And he’s like, “Hi, Harriet,”
    \<i\>‘cause on my Twitter bio, it says,\</i\> “Being a reporter
    was the closest I could get to being Harriet the Spy.” He was like,
    “You know what? You and I are gonna get along.” \<i\>We decide
    we’re gonna meet in a hotel.\</i\> \<i\>\[suspenseful
    music\]\</i\> - He kind of barreled through the door once again...
    \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> And kind of plopped down once again. \<i\>He had the
    same messenger bag. He had the same shirt.\</i\> \<i\>He had, I
    think, the same pants\</i\> \<i\>and definitely the same
    flip-flops\</i\> and definitely no pedicure. \<i\>JESSICA: He almost
    immediately pulls out\</i\> this big bottle of unopened Japanese
    whiskey... \<i\>Hibiki Harmony, I think it was.\</i\> \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\>
    \<i\>We wanted to understand what he had.\</i\> We wanted to get as
    much documentation as possible at that meeting. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\>
    \<i\>EMILY: One of the first things that he says to us\</i\> is that
    the lawyers were hatching a plan. - And he starts describing the
    specifics of their plan. - The thing that blows our minds really
    quickly is the degree of detail that he goes into about the plan to
    orchestrate what, to him, feels like a blackmail scheme.
    \<i\>JESSICA: And he pulls out this retention agreement\</i\>
    \<i\>that he had gotten.\</i\> \<i\>JACOB: It’s, like, a dozen
    points.\</i\> \<i\>It’s a completely detailed contract.\</i\>
    \<i\>EMILY: What he said is that Stan Pottinger\</i\> had identified
    four very, very, very rich men. \<i\>JESSICA: All of whom Patrick
    says he has on tape,\</i\> \<i\>and they’re gonna go to these four
    men,\</i\> present them with this footage, and say... - “We have
    video of you. We have photographs of you. “And if you pay this
    enormous amount of money, we will make this problem go away.”
    \<i\>JESSICA: Stan Pottinger called this list of wealthy men\</i\>
    their “hot list.” \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>The sums that Patrick said
    they were demanding\</i\> \<i\>were astronomical.\</i\> - He said
    that the lawyers would take a 40% cut. - A fraction of that going to
    Patrick Kessler \<i\>and the remainder going into a foundation\</i\>
    \<i\>that they were setting up to benefit abused women.\</i\>
    \<i\>EMILY: If true, this not only could crack open\</i\> \<i\>the
    Epstein story,\</i\> \<i\>but it also might expose\</i\> \<i\>how
    two of America’s most prominent lawyers\</i\> \<i\>were talking
    about plans\</i\> that would keep evidence of abuse secret.
    \<i\>\[dramatic music\]\</i\> \<i\>JESSICA: The meeting didn’t
    end\</i\> \<i\>after Patrick outlined the plan by the lawyers.\</i\>
    \<i\>It was really only the beginning,\</i\> because he starts
    telling us a lot more about who he is. \<i\>He explains that he was
    abused as a child\</i\> \<i\>by a Bible-school teacher.\</i\> - He
    said that that’s really motivated him to hold people who are abusers
    of children to account. - This became kind of his cause.
    \<i\>JESSICA: He said that he found a community\</i\> \<i\>of
    likeminded hackers,\</i\> many of whom had also been abused as
    children. \<i\>DAVID: He said that their mission was to
    identify\</i\> and track down sexual predators. \<i\>He painted this
    kind of sad\</i\> but very shady picture of himself. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\>
    \<i\>JESSICA: Patrick claims to have\</i\> \<i\>hundreds of
    thousands of hours of footage,\</i\> but we wanted proof that what
    he said he had was real. And so he says that he’s going to get it to
    us. \<i\>EMILY: He tells us that he isn’t just there representing
    himself,\</i\> that he’s there representing a team... \<i\>and that
    they’re all in agreement\</i\> \<i\>that they’ll deliver this
    information\</i\> to “The New York Times.” - He’s vague on the
    details. - They will do this through physical servers, that they’ve
    decided that’s the most secure method. - And it may take up to two
    weeks. - That we’ll have a certain number of months with this
    information, and then it all will be posted online.
    \<i\>Essentially, he’s saying,\</i\> “Get ready. There’s gonna be
    something delivered. It’s gonna be good.” As journalists, we’re
    trained to be skeptical, and one of the, like, old adages is, like,
    you have to even fact-check what your mom says. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\>
    \<i\>JESSICA: We look into three things\</i\> \<i\>that Patrick had
    told us about himself.\</i\> One of them is, he says that he was an
    early investor in this coffee company. \<i\>He has a sticker from
    the coffee company\</i\> \<i\>on his laptop.\</i\> Turns out that
    there is no investor matching that description that has ever been
    involved in the coffee company. - Patrick also showed us a secret
    CIA document \<i\>that he had access to.\</i\> Later that night, I
    got on the train and looked it up, \<i\>and it came right up in
    Google.\</i\> Didn’t seem so secret. - Patrick had said that he had
    been connected to Jeffrey Epstein through John McAfee, \<i\>who is
    the antivirus software pioneer.\</i\> - This, like, reclusive, very
    strange businessperson who’s in hiding. \<i\>We eventually get in
    touch with him,\</i\> \<i\>and says that he’ll only speak on
    Skype.\</i\> And we’re both sitting there, and he’s in what I can
    only describe as, like, a tin, like, hut. \<i\>We ask him whether
    he’s introduced anyone to Epstein,\</i\> \<i\>and he refuses to
    confirm or deny.\</i\> - You never know whether someone has
    information or not. I remember I said to someone, I think it was
    Enrich, “This is no better than 50/50.” \<i\>\[mysterious
    music\]\</i\> So the question became, how were we gonna get the
    information \<i\>directly from Patrick?\</i\> \<i\>EMILY: He wants
    to meet with us again\</i\> so that he can give us the tools or the
    keys that we need to be able to unlock this information that will be
    encrypted. - So, on October 1st, we all go down to meet Patrick.
    \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>JACOB: At the Barrow Street Alehouse.\</i\>
    \<i\>He again wore the same outfit.\</i\> \<i\>He plopped down in
    his seat,\</i\> \<i\>and he drank a lot, and he talked a lot.\</i\>
    \<i\>He kept telling stories and—\</i\> It was like he didn’t want
    things to end. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> \<i\>JESSICA: He tells us this is the

    thumb drive that we would use to communicate with his colleague
    named Weep. \<i\>Weep would give us a code\</i\> \<i\>that would

    files will self-destruct \<i\>if more than one computer\</i\> is

    \<i\>is talk to David Boies and Stan Pottinger\</i\> about what we
    found. BOIES: Hi. DAVID: Hey. BOIES: Good to see you. DAVID:
    Likewise. Come on in. In one of the hypotheticals that Pottinger

    no client.\</i\> \<i\>This is simply a way\</i\> to make a problem
    go away for a very rich man, \<i\>but it does nothing at all\</i\>
    \<i\>to expose the institutional systemic wrongdoing\</i\> that many
    of their clients say they want to be attacking. BOIES: My firm—one
    of our... pro bono areas of concentration has been representing and
    advocating for abused and disadvantaged women and children. By the
    time we got to September of 2019, Epstein’s arrested, he’s died. The
    press is now paying attention to this. We spent, you know, three and
    a half, four, five years when nobody was interested in this case
    and, um, what Patrick offered, if he were real, is something that
    would move that process forward very fast. It would have been a game
    changer. DAVID: Yeah. - I mean, it confirmed what we had believed
    and what I had been saying for years, which is that the scope and
    scale of Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation was unparalleled. We
    had somewhat different interests. His interest was get everything
    out there. - Yeah. - Our interest was we want it all to get out, but
    we don’t necessarily want it all to get out immediately. - Yeah.
    BOIES: The whole point that we have as lawyers is that if we have
    information that’s related to our clients, we want to be sure that
    we use it in the way that’s most effective for our clients. JESSICA:
    Mm-hmm. - Is there any way he might’ve gotten the impression before
    the meeting with Emily and Jacob that you and Stan wanted him to
    only focus on two names? - I don’t—no. DAVID: Okay. - Look, there’s
    no way he could have gotten the impression before that meeting that
    we were trying to censor him. - I think maybe this would be a good
    moment to show you some things. BOIES: Sure, sure. - Yeah. - You’d
    mentioned that you’d seen some of the text messages between Stan— -
    Well, I-I’m— What I’m aware of is Stan’s description of them to me.
    JESSICA: Ah, okay. Here. DAVID: We have them. Maybe that will help
    kind of clarify some things. - To be frank, they— - Yeah. - This
    suggests to me some inconsistencies in what we’ve been talking
    about, but let’s go through them because we want to hear your
    thoughts. - \[stammering\] Before— Don’t—don’t do that, okay? I
    mean, don’t start talking about inconsistencies like that, because I
    don’t think there’s any inconsistency here. - Okay, well, but you
    haven’t read these. - No, but there can’t be any inconsistency with
    what I’ve told you. DAVID: Well, maybe— - No, but listen to me, all
    right? Because what I’ve told you is what I did. There can’t be any
    inconsistency between what I told you and what’s in here ‘cause I
    didn’t do this. - So maybe let’s just go through some of this so we
    can just talk this out. So this is Stan laying out where you guys
    are gonna meet with Emily and Jacob. - Right. - And it says, “I will
    meet you there at 8:00 a.m. “At 10:00, we will meet there with two
    reporters. “Not a long meeting. “You will be there simply to give
    cred to the source of info and certain subjects will be off-limits.”
    So we had just asked you previously if there’s any way Patrick
    might’ve gotten the impression that you guys were telling him to
    limit the information shared, and you said, no, there is not a way
    that he could’ve gotten the impression. - And that— DAVID: So that
    strikes me as inconsistent. - No, no, well, I had had one
    conversation with him, and there was no way that he could’ve gotten
    that from that conversation. DAVID: Okay. BOIES: I didn’t realize
    that there were text messages that had preceded that meeting. - So
    we next get to this page. - This is Stan talking? DAVID: Yes.
    JESSICA: Yes. - What is he responding to? - Patrick asked, “How
    would this work?” And Stan explains it. He lays out two
    hypotheticals. One is what he calls a standard model. - The second
    one I’m most interested in. BOIES: Yeah. - Because I’ve never seen
    anything like it before. DAVID: He says, “No client is actually
    involved in this structure.” You said earlier that there would be—
    in any of these scenarios, there would be a client, and I’m curious
    how you square that with Stan saying, “No client is actually
    involved in this structure.” - Well, what he’s laying it out to
    Patrick is a hypothetical, and I can tell you that it’s a
    hypothetical that nobody ever did. This is somebody... who, the more
    I go through this stuff, looks to me here like he’s trying to set
    Stan up. DAVID: We’re eager for your interpretation of what the
    words on the page mean. - Are there text messages in between these
    two pages? - I don’t know. BOIES: Okay. DAVID: We’re not trying to
    build a legal case here. We’re not trying to convince a jury. - No,
    I— - But listen. We’re trying to understand if there’s a way to
    interpret this other than the way that it looks to us. - And what
    I’m saying is that these aren’t my text messages, okay? - These
    are all the words of Stan Pottinger, who... - No, but— - Was working
    with you. - Yes, but—but— No, well, you keep saying that. Um...
    DAVID: That’s what you said. - \[stammering\] Yes. Um, uh, but you
    keep implying that he’s working with me on this. - Well, yeah,
    because we discussed this at the Harvard Club. - We did not discuss
    this at the Harvard Club. DAVID: Not in this level of detail, David,
    but we discussed— - We did not discuss this at the Harvard Club. -
    Not in anything remotely resembling this detail but we very clearly
    discussed the plans to set up a foundation to have it get funded by
    abusers, and this is laying out in, I think, fairly clear detail the
    mechanics by which you guys were proposing to do that. And so,
    again, I’m interested— please tell me how I’m wrong. - Well, for one
    thing you keep saying, “You guys.” I didn’t write this text, and I
    haven’t had a chance to talk to Stan about what he meant by it. -
    Patrick was uncomfortable with that because of what it would mean
    for the videos. He thought that it was essentially a way of burying
    the videos. BOIES: If you’re bringing a settlement to somebody who
    you’ve got a claim against, they don’t know what the evidence is
    until you show it to them. Once it’s public, everybody knows about
    it. - And what’s the problem with that? - Well, your leverage is
    gone. You don’t have the ability to provide them with the
    information in the settlement that allows them to think they’re
    getting something. DAVID: What would they be getting? - What they’d
    be getting is peace. People want to avoid litigation. They want to
    avoid the risks and uncertainties of going to a jury trial. - They
    often want to avoid damaging information like videos becoming
    public. - And they also want to avoid damaging information, no
    question about it. I think that although some of the language that I
    think Stan used was a little loose here, I think that if what he
    meant was that we want to control the information for the benefit of
    our clients, I think that is legitimate. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\>

    settled,\</i\> \<i\>you represent the wrongdoer if he says,\</i\>
    \<i\>“I want you to be my lawyer going forward.”\</i\> - You would
    go from representing a victim of abuse to representing the person
    who perpetrated that abuse? That feels good to you? \<i\>STAN: No,
    it’s not— it’s not real.\</i\> \<i\>It has nothing to do\</i\>
    \<i\>with what would actually be done at all.\</i\> \<i\>I didn’t
    owe Patrick 100% honesty.\</i\> \<i\>The hypothetical two, which is
    hypothetical,\</i\> \<i\>was done strictly to try to get him to send
    us the servers.\</i\> DAVID: You said you were misleading him
    deliberately to get the servers, and I’m wondering if it’s common
    practice for you or for lawyers in general to deliberately mislead
    potential witnesses. \<i\>STAN: I have no idea. Do you?\</i\> EMILY:
    Well, have you done this before? \<i\>STAN: Never.\</i\> EMILY: So
    why now? \<i\>STAN: To get the servers.\</i\> - So you’re willing to
    do anything to get it? \<i\>STAN: \[scoffs\] No, I would not do
    anything to get it.\</i\> \<i\>That’s... really quite strange.\</i\>
    - So where do you draw the line? \<i\>STAN: Where do you?\</i\>
    DAVID: What would happen in this settlement that you’re discussing?
    What happens to the underlying video? \<i\>\[dramatic music\]\</i\>
    \<i\>STAN: I don’t know. I have to think about that.\</i\> - Does it
    become public? \<i\>STAN: I don’t want to speculate about that since
    we never did it.\</i\> - Seems like they’re paying in part to make
    these videos go away. \<i\>STAN: Oh, well, I would think so.
    Wouldn’t you?\</i\> - I would think so, yes. \<i\>STAN: I would
    think so,\</i\> \<i\>but I’m not gonna speculate what they would do
    with the video.\</i\> \<i\>All right, thank you very, very
    much.\</i\> EMILY: Yeah, thanks for your time. If there’s anything
    more. JACOB: Thank you. - Thanks, Stan. \<i\>STAN: Okay, bye-bye.
    \</i\>EMILY: Bye. JACOB: Bye. \<i\>♪ ♪\</i\> We’ve spent the past
    three months in this weird twilight zone where nothing is as it
    seems. Facts change, people change their stories, people are lying,
    people are manipulating each other. - We still don’t know who
    Patrick Kessler is. We are no closer to proving whether Jeffrey
    Epstein had a blackmail operation, and we don’t know exactly what
    the lawyers would’ve done had this information come through. - But
    the story is a glimpse into how big-money clients and big-money law
    solve problems. - What Patrick helped us see was that these lawyers,
    the ones that are hailed as champions of women, participate in a
    system that does allow evidence of wrongdoing to just never see the
    light of day. - It just makes you wonder, like, what are the effects
    of all of these secrets? What is the impact of a conspiracy of
    silence? And what secrets do powerful people have about each other,
    and what does that allow them to get away
with?

**Producer/Director** John Pappas

When a big bear of a man in flip-flops showed up with a bottle of
Japanese whiskey promising to deliver evidence implicating some of the
world’s richest and most powerful men in an epic cover-up of sexual
misconduct, our reporters were hooked.

The man went by a pseudonym, Patrick Kessler, and he said he had
terabytes of video surveillance from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences and
other materials that, if true, would validate theories Epstein was
engaged in an extensive blackmail operation. Kessler said he would share
it all with The New York Times.

This special hourlong episode of “The Weekly” tells the wild story of
four Times reporters chasing one of the biggest stories of the year – if
only it were true. In the course of their reporting, they get a rare
glimpse into the secretive world of legal settlements in which wealthy
people are allowed to make damning evidence disappear.

### <span>**Featured Reporters**</span>

More than a dozen New York Times reporters have been investigating the
Jeffrey Epstein case, including several members of the Business desk,
led by **Ellen Pollock**. For this special episode of “The Weekly,” the
finance editor **David Enrich** and business reporters **Jessica
Silver-Greenberg** and **Emily Steel** teamed up with **Jacob
Bernstein** of the Styles desk to chase down a too-good-to-be-true lead
in the Epstein case.

### <span>Our Reporters’<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Top 3 Takeaways</span>

  - **“Rich Man’s Justice” is alive and well.** The famous litigator
    David Boies has decried secret legal settlements in which wealthy
    men accused of abuse pay money in exchange for evidence of
    wrongdoing remaining private. But he and his associate John Stanley
    Pottinger were envisioning using supposed surveillance videos to
    secure settlements that, by both lawyers’ acknowledgments, might
    have resulted in the videos staying secret.

  - **Lawyers go to extreme lengths to ingratiate themselves with
    witnesses.** Pottinger in particular pulled out the stops in pursuit
    of Patrick Kessler’s cache. Pottinger took him out for chicken
    parmigiana and gave him a signed copy of one of his novels. He
    presented Kessler with a draft retention agreement that explained,
    in writing, how the lawyers might extract money from wealthy men
    associated with Epstein. Pottinger later told us that many of his
    overtures were lies meant to win over Kessler.

  - **The ghost of Jeffrey Epstein haunts us all.** Just like Boies and
    Pottinger, we were predisposed to believe Kessler’s sensational
    story. Why? In part because we have been trying to figure out how
    Epstein surrounded himself with rich, powerful people, even after he
    was exposed as a sexual predator. Kessler’s supposed trove might
    have provided an answer: Epstein was using damning video to extort
    the men in his circle.

  -   
    \[MUSIC PLAYING\] “The story really began for us the day in July
    that Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and criminally charged with sex
    trafficking of minors.” “Suddenly he was someone we were thinking
    about. One of the big questions was, where his money was from?” “How
    does someone like that come up with hundreds of millions of
    dollars?” “And we were tantalized by the fact that he seemed to
    have influence with a lot of powerful people.” “These weren’t models
    and Hollywood people. These are some of the biggest names in
    business and finance.” “They were Nobel Prize winners, Wall Street
    bigwigs.” “The list goes on and on. And we wanted to figure out why
    people had gravitated to him even after he had become known as a
    sexual predator.” “And then in September our reporters met a man who
    claimed to have a secret trove of information from Epstein’s
    properties.” “This is someone who had extraordinary, probably
    unparalleled inside access, to not only Epstein, but Epstein’s
    digital archive.” “If what the informant was saying was true, it had
    the potential to unlock Jeffrey Epstein’s most important secrets.”

### <span>**Who Is Patrick Kessler?**</span>

Among the many unusual things about this episode — and our reporting on
this story — is the fact that we regrettably still have no idea who
Patrick Kessler is. He seemed to appear out of the ether, and he
continues to reside there.

From the first time we met him, he insisted that he would not disclose
his identity. He agreed to sit for an on-camera interview — but only if
we obscured his face. We generally don’t grant anonymity to such
characters, but in this case we thought it was justified because it
would allow us to share his voice and physical outline with viewers.
Maybe you’ll hear him and know who he is.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We pushed him, sometimes gently and sometimes aggressively, to tell us.
He always refused. He claimed to live within a three-hour radius of
Washington, D.C., but we don’t know if that’s three hours by plane,
train or car. Even if it’s by foot it doesn’t help much.

Many details he shared about his background didn’t hold up after
fact-checking. Even his explanation for his motives seemed dishonest. In
the end, we can only guess why someone would make up an elaborate claim
about surveillance videos and spend many hours over the course of
several months engaging lawyers and journalists.

We’re eager to hear your theories after you watch the
episode.
