  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: This
  story really began for us the day in July\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}that Jeffrey Epstein was
  arrested\textless{}/i\textgreater{} and criminally charged with sex
  trafficking of minors. ELLEN: Suddenly, he was someone we were
  thinking about. One of the big questions was where his money was from.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: This is a college
  dropout,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}a former
  high-school math teacher\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}who had had scant Wall Street
  experience.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}How
  does someone like that\textless{}/i\textgreater{} come up with
  hundreds of millions of dollars? \textless{}i\textgreater{}ELLEN: And
  we were tantalized by the fact that\textless{}/i\textgreater{} he
  seemed to have influence with a lot of powerful people.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: And these weren't models and
  Hollywood people.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} These are some of the
  biggest names in business and finance. ELLEN: They were Nobel Prize
  winners, Wall Street bigwigs. DAVID: The list goes on and on.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}And we wanted to figure out why people had
  gravitated to him\textless{}/i\textgreater{} even after he had become
  known as a sexual predator. \textless{}i\textgreater{}ELLEN: And then
  in September, our reporters met a man\textless{}/i\textgreater{} who
  claimed to have a secret trove of information
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}from Epstein's
  properties.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: This is someone who had
  extraordinary,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} probably unparalleled inside
  access to not only Epstein, but Epstein's digital archive.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}ELLEN: If what the informant was saying was
  true,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} it had the potential to unlock
  Jeffrey Epstein's most important secrets.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}dramatic
  music{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - I think that this story is a window
  into how things work behind... the curtain of wealth and power. And to
  be honest, it's a little bit about journalism, too.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}sparse suspenseful
  music{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}I personally,
  or as a journalist,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}do not care who is sleeping with
  whom.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}That is not
  my business.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}But
  it is my business\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}to understand what was going on with Jeffrey
  Epstein,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and
  throughout all of the Epstein story,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}there was sort of the whiff of
  blackmail.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - And the people who were
  involved in this just refused to say anything, which---we're
  journalists. There's nothing that piques our curiosity more than a
  bunch of rich, powerful people saying, ``There's nothing to see
  here.'' \textless{}i\textgreater{}So we started
  digging.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}ELLEN:
  We had a lot of reporters sort of working on these related
  stories,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} and this sort of brought a bunch
  of them together. Jacob---you know, to be honest, I don't remember how
  Jacob got involved. I don't actually remember. - Originally, I wasn't
  quite part of the team. You know, I work on the Styles desk, which we
  sometimes joke is the toy department of ``The New York Times.'' But I
  kind of couldn't drop the story. \textless{}i\textgreater{}The cast of
  characters was too dark\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and, at the same time, too colorful and
  weird.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - But we wouldn't be here without
  Jacob. \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: I was looking into Jeffrey
  Epstein's rise\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}in
  the 1980s, and I called Stan Pottinger\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  because he was representing victims, and I figured that he might know
  or have heard some stuff along the way.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: Stan Pottinger is a former
  official\textless{}/i\textgreater{} back in the Nixon and Ford
  presidential administrations. ANCHOR: He is a former assistant
  attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}ELLEN: Was a longtime lawyer, famous for
  dating Gloria Steinem.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}He was sort of a man around town in New
  York.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - And generally quite well regarded.
  - You can trust the process. You should come forward and help see that
  justice is done. - Some of the questions that I was asking him---
  most, actually--- he didn't know about. So I hung up the phone, and a
  couple of hours later, he called me back and said, ``I think maybe we
  should meet.'' - Pottinger mentions something extremely juicy to
  Jacob, which is that--- ``We have an informant.''
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: And he said, ``I'm working with David
  Boies,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} ``and we have found this guy who we
  believe has access ``to an enormous amount of information about
  Jeffrey Epstein.'' \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: At the time that
  we first heard from Pottinger\textless{}/i\textgreater{} about this
  informant, he and David Boies were two of the most prominent lawyers
  representing alleged victims of Epstein. {[}indistinct chatter{]}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: David Boies is one of the most
  powerful lawyers\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}in the country
  today.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} For a while he was kind of lauded as
  the modern-day Atticus Finch. \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID:
  Litigating some of the country's most famous
  cases,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}whether
  it's Bush v. Gore or the Microsoft antitrust
  case\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}or gay
  marriage before the Supreme Court.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} -
  Marriage equality will be the law throughout this land. - And his
  reputation had been somewhat tarnished because he represented Harvey
  Weinstein. \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: Boies helped Weinstein
  hire Black Cube---\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}a firm that worked to
  manipulate\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Weinstein's alleged victims and deceive
  reporters.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}The
  ``Times'' had worked with Bois' firm in the
  past\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and fired
  them after learning about this.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}- B-O-I-E-S.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: For David Boies, the Epstein
  saga\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}provided him
  almost, like, a redemption tour.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} And he's
  really been out representing himself \textless{}i\textgreater{}as a
  huge advocate for sex abuse victims.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} So
  he's a really complicated character but also really considered almost
  like royalty in the American legal community.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}Jacob was setting up this meeting with the
  lawyers\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and the
  informant.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} We planned to meet on Saturday
  morning on September 14th at the Boies Schiller law firm.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: We get there, and we are quickly
  told\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}that we're
  going to drop our phones and our laptops.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: And then we walk in, and we met the
  informant.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} I would describe him as this
  bear of a man. He's probably, like, two or three times my size. - He
  wore a blue shirt, and he had flip-flops on.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: And the meeting is off the
  record,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} so that means that we can't talk
  about it now. \textless{}i\textgreater{}But we left feeling pretty
  excited.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB:
  The informant--- he was compelling,
  actually.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} There was a calmness about him
  that day that indicated that he wasn't desperate.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: And so we walk up to ``The New York
  Times'' building,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} and I get an email that
  says, ``Are you free?'' It's from the informant. And right away I
  respond and say, ``Yes,'' period. And then he says, ``Where can we
  meet?'' \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: The secret source is reaching
  out to us directly.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} That is gold. It means
  that the source wants an unchaperoned setting.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: We quickly moved to a Chinese
  restaurant.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}In
  the middle of the day, it tends to be
  empty,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and indeed
  it was.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} To our right was a group of women
  who were snipping string beans. \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: It's,
  like, this giant mound in the middle of the
  table,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and
  they're just kind of snipping off the ends of these green
  beans.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: But
  other than that, there was almost no one in the
  restaurant.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} {[}door bells jingle{]}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}He got there a few minutes after we did, and
  he sat down.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}He,
  you know, took off his messenger bag,
  and...\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}he hadn't
  gotten a pedicure, you know?\textless{}/i\textgreater{} I mean, he's a
  big guy. He looked the part. \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: One of
  the first things that he says is,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}``I don't like
  lawyers.''\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}And
  he's really ready to have a real
  conversation.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: We are told to call him Patrick
  Kessler.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}We are
  told that this is a pseudonym\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}because he lives this clandestine
  life.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - What he also tells us is that he
  was one of the early creators of this messaging system that allowed
  people to send very encrypted, very secure messages, and that's
  actually how he was connected to Jeffrey Epstein.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: He claimed to have gone to work for
  Epstein\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}after
  Epstein got out of jail in 2009,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and he claimed that Epstein had a
  surveillance system.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - He says that Jeffrey
  Epstein wanted to use his system to store vast amounts of surveillance
  footage, \textless{}i\textgreater{}and he said Epstein had four
  cameras running in each of the bedrooms.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: He said that the cameras were
  recording all the time---\textless{}/i\textgreater{} in New York, in
  Palm Beach, in London. \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: So there would
  be thousands upon thousands\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}of hours of
  footage.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}And he
  pulled out his phone,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and he started to kind of scroll
  through\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}some
  different pictures that he said were stills\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}from the video
  footage.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}There
  were images of people receiving oral sex.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}There were images of people having
  sex.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}And he said
  that within some of that video data\textless{}/i\textgreater{} were
  powerful, prominent men abusing young women.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}But then he told us something
  else,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and this
  was about the lawyers.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: He said, ``What do you think of David
  Boies?''\textless{}/i\textgreater{} And then he began to kind of
  express reservations. \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: What Patrick
  told us is that he had information\textless{}/i\textgreater{} about a
  number of very powerful men but that the lawyers told him to stick to
  only two. - Because those were the only people that they wanted out at
  that time. - He thought that they were motivated by money.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: At the end of the meeting, the way
  that we left it\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}was that he would keep talking to the
  lawyers,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} but we would also talk to him
  separately. \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: We had spent months
  thinking about,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} ``Was there a blackmail
  scheme that Epstein was using? Was there secret video surveillance?''
  And here we have a guy who comes more or less out of the woodwork and
  says not only was there, but, ``I have it.''
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: After we left the first
  meeting,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}I was
  certainly skeptical in some ways,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}but it was
  plausible\textless{}/i\textgreater{} that hidden-camera systems would
  exist, you know? When the raid on Epstein's Palm Beach mansion
  happened, \textless{}i\textgreater{}there were all these wires from
  the walls.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}It
  seemed like computers\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and perhaps cameras had been
  removed.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY:
  I've also been speaking with this woman named Maria
  Farmer,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}who said
  that she was abused by Jeffrey Epstein.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  Maria said that Jeffrey took her to this room that she described kind
  of as a surveillance room that has a number of screens displaying what
  went on in his property. \textless{}i\textgreater{}He told her that he
  was using this\textless{}/i\textgreater{} to keep track of everything
  that went on in his house, that he was keeping it in case he needed it
  someday. \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB: Jeffrey Epstein had also
  told ``The New York Times''\textless{}/i\textgreater{} that he had a
  lot of information about powerful people.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}And so there was this implication, even from
  him,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} that if you messed with him, he could
  damage you. \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}suspenseful
  music{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}ELLEN:
  Of course, it sounds very salacious.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} But
  the truth is, we were trying to answer a question, which was, ``What
  did Jeffrey Epstein have on all these powerful, powerful, wealthy
  men?'' {[}phone dings{]} \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: So that
  Monday,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}Patrick
  says that there's more that he wants to talk
  about\textless{}/i\textgreater{} but that we need to talk in person.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: He had said he was going to be in
  Washington\textless{}/i\textgreater{} and planned to have some
  meetings on Capitol Hill, and that just scared the shit out of us.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}It was guaranteed to leak
  instantly.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY:
  Jacob and I kind of arranged to go to D.C.,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  and we also pull in another reporter. - They ask him if they can
  introduce, like, a third person. - We just said, ``You'll like her. We
  feel you will like her.'' And indeed he did. - And he's like, ``Hi,
  Harriet,'' \textless{}i\textgreater{}`cause on my Twitter bio, it
  says,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} ``Being a reporter was the closest I
  could get to being Harriet the Spy.'' He was like, ``You know what?
  You and I are gonna get along.'' \textless{}i\textgreater{}We decide
  we're gonna meet in a hotel.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}suspenseful
  music{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - He kind of barreled through the
  door once again... \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} And kind of plopped down once again.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}He had the same messenger bag. He had the
  same shirt.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}He
  had, I think, the same pants\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and definitely the same
  flip-flops\textless{}/i\textgreater{} and definitely no pedicure.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JESSICA: He almost immediately pulls
  out\textless{}/i\textgreater{} this big bottle of unopened Japanese
  whiskey... \textless{}i\textgreater{}Hibiki Harmony, I think it
  was.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}We wanted to
  understand what he had.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} We wanted to get as
  much documentation as possible at that meeting.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: One of the first things that he says
  to us\textless{}/i\textgreater{} is that the lawyers were hatching a
  plan. - And he starts describing the specifics of their plan. - The
  thing that blows our minds really quickly is the degree of detail that
  he goes into about the plan to orchestrate what, to him, feels like a
  blackmail scheme. \textless{}i\textgreater{}JESSICA: And he pulls out
  this retention agreement\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}that he had
  gotten.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}JACOB:
  It's, like, a dozen points.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}It's a completely detailed
  contract.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY:
  What he said is that Stan Pottinger\textless{}/i\textgreater{} had
  identified four very, very, very rich men.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JESSICA: All of whom Patrick says he has on
  tape,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and they're
  gonna go to these four men,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} present them
  with this footage, and say... - ``We have video of you. We have
  photographs of you. ``And if you pay this enormous amount of money, we
  will make this problem go away.'' \textless{}i\textgreater{}JESSICA:
  Stan Pottinger called this list of wealthy
  men\textless{}/i\textgreater{} their ``hot list.''
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}The sums that Patrick said they were
  demanding\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}were
  astronomical.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - He said that the lawyers
  would take a 40\% cut. - A fraction of that going to Patrick Kessler
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and the remainder going into a
  foundation\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}that
  they were setting up to benefit abused
  women.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: If
  true, this not only could crack open\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}the Epstein
  story,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}but it
  also might expose\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}how two of America's most prominent
  lawyers\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}were
  talking about plans\textless{}/i\textgreater{} that would keep
  evidence of abuse secret. \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}dramatic
  music{]}\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}JESSICA:
  The meeting didn't end\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}after Patrick outlined the plan by the
  lawyers.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}It was
  really only the beginning,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} because he
  starts telling us a lot more about who he is.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}He explains that he was abused as a
  child\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}by a
  Bible-school teacher.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - He said that that's
  really motivated him to hold people who are abusers of children to
  account. - This became kind of his cause.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JESSICA: He said that he found a
  community\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}of
  likeminded hackers,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} many of whom had also
  been abused as children. \textless{}i\textgreater{}DAVID: He said that
  their mission was to identify\textless{}/i\textgreater{} and track
  down sexual predators. \textless{}i\textgreater{}He painted this kind
  of sad\textless{}/i\textgreater{} but very shady picture of himself.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JESSICA: Patrick claims to
  have\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}hundreds of
  thousands of hours of footage,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} but we
  wanted proof that what he said he had was real. And so he says that
  he's going to get it to us. \textless{}i\textgreater{}EMILY: He tells
  us that he isn't just there representing
  himself,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} that he's there representing a
  team... \textless{}i\textgreater{}and that they're all in
  agreement\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}that
  they'll deliver this information\textless{}/i\textgreater{} to ``The
  New York Times.'' - He's vague on the details. - They will do this
  through physical servers, that they've decided that's the most secure
  method. - And it may take up to two weeks. - That we'll have a certain
  number of months with this information, and then it all will be posted
  online. \textless{}i\textgreater{}Essentially, he's
  saying,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} ``Get ready. There's gonna be
  something delivered. It's gonna be good.'' As journalists, we're
  trained to be skeptical, and one of the, like, old adages is, like,
  you have to even fact-check what your mom says.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪ ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}JESSICA: We look into three
  things\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}that
  Patrick had told us about himself.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} One of
  them is, he says that he was an early investor in this coffee company.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}He has a sticker from the coffee
  company\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}on his
  laptop.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} Turns out that there is no investor
  matching that description that has ever been involved in the coffee
  company. - Patrick also showed us a secret CIA document
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}that he had access
  to.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} Later that night, I got on the train
  and looked it up, \textless{}i\textgreater{}and it came right up in
  Google.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} Didn't seem so secret. - Patrick
  had said that he had been connected to Jeffrey Epstein through John
  McAfee, \textless{}i\textgreater{}who is the antivirus software
  pioneer.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - This, like, reclusive, very
  strange businessperson who's in hiding. \textless{}i\textgreater{}We
  eventually get in touch with him,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}and says that he'll only speak on
  Skype.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} And we're both sitting there, and
  he's in what I can only describe as, like, a tin, like, hut.
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}We ask him whether he's introduced anyone to
  Epstein,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and he
  refuses to confirm or deny.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} - You never
  know whether someone has information or not. I remember I said to
  someone, I think it was Enrich, ``This is no better than 50/50.''
  \textless{}i\textgreater{}{[}mysterious

  of the Epstein story on his shoulders. \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪
  ♪\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}So he's like,

  warned, these files will self-destruct \textless{}i\textgreater{}if
  more than one computer\textless{}/i\textgreater{} is plugged into the

    these messages show is the lawyers discussing
    plans\textless{}/i\textgreater{} in which they would go to the men

    money out of them. The way they would do that was basically saying,

    case, it's a crucial piece\textless{}/i\textgreater{} because this
    is a man who, whatever his motivations, whatever his backstory, has
    managed to enlist David Boies and Stan Pottinger in something that
    is now much bigger than Patrick. \textless{}i\textgreater{}So it
    seems like we've got to do, like, a bunch of things,
    right?\textless{}/i\textgreater{} JESSICA: We have made plans for
    Patrick to meet us in Baltimore. I said, ``I've secured a promise
    that we will obscure your face in the shoot.''
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}He said that he insisted on
    anonymity\textless{}/i\textgreater{} because he claimed that his
    life would be in danger if his real identity was known. We need to
    do two main things--- we need to go over every aspect of this story
    so that there are no surprises, `cause this may very well be the
    last time we get access to him. And then we need to have a real
    confrontation with him to try to learn his identity. - So what are
    odds that he shows up? - If he says he's gonna show up, he'll show
    up. \textless{}i\textgreater{}CREW MEMBER: Patrick, we're all

    I may be naive, but why can't you tell us who you are? - I---because
    it affects so many other people. Put yourself in my position and
    tell me that you would tell me what your name is. - If you want to
    make good on your genuine feeling for the work we're trying to do,
    the best way for you to do that is to, like, to be honest with us
    about who you are.
  \item
    Oh, that's not gonna happen. {[}laughs{]} It's a great spiel. I
    appreciate it. - I mean, it's an honest spiel, and when we do know
    something--- the things we've tried to check out, those things
    haven't checked out. - When we met, you had a sticker of a coffee
    company on your laptop, and you told us that you had been an
    investor in that company. So we called them, and we said, ``Does
    anybody matching your description, were they ever an investor?'' -
    No, and that investment is null completely. They have paid back in
    coffee. - How big? Like, how much money did you put in? - I have no
    idea. EMILY: The copies of the servers were destroyed. - Mm. - But
    what happened to the original? - Oh, I still have those. EMILY: You
    still have those? - Certainly. Yeah, I would never take the only
    copy anywhere. That makes no sense. EMILY: Where are those now? - In
    a place. - There is a huge question as to whether you have what you
    say you have, right?
  \item
    I completely agree. - And you look like potentially an unreliable
    narrator, and in this case, we can't even say that we are aware that
    this footage exists. - Sure. - But this story is the story we have,
    and it's a story we care about right now, and it's a story that we
    think is really important because it speaks to the system that
    continues to bury information. - Well, let's back up quickly, all
    right? - Yeah. - And go through a couple of things. A, it doesn't
    matter. - What do you mean it doesn't matter? - And I am not saying
    this is true, because the fact is that I do have this information.
    But let's imagine that I don't. It doesn't affect the story. The
    story is about the lawyers and how they tried to manipulate the

    we found. BOIES: Hi. DAVID: Hey. BOIES: Good to see you. DAVID:
    Likewise. Come on in. In one of the hypotheticals that Pottinger
    laid out if you take his words at face value,
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}there simply is no
    client.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}This is

    expose the institutional systemic
    wrongdoing\textless{}/i\textgreater{} that many of their clients say
    they want to be attacking. BOIES: My firm---one of our... pro bono
    areas of concentration has been representing and advocating for
    abused and disadvantaged women and children. By the time we got to
    September of 2019, Epstein's arrested, he's died. The press is now
    paying attention to this. We spent, you know, three and a half,
    four, five years when nobody was interested in this case and, um,
    what Patrick offered, if he were real, is something that would move
    that process forward very fast. It would have been a game changer.
    DAVID: Yeah. - I mean, it confirmed what we had believed and what I
    had been saying for years, which is that the scope and scale of
    Epstein's sex-trafficking operation was unparalleled. We had
    somewhat different interests. His interest was get everything out
    there. - Yeah. - Our interest was we want it all to get out, but we
    don't necessarily want it all to get out immediately. - Yeah. BOIES:
    The whole point that we have as lawyers is that if we have
    information that's related to our clients, we want to be sure that
    we use it in the way that's most effective for our clients. JESSICA:
    Mm-hmm. - Is there any way he might've gotten the impression before
    the meeting with Emily and Jacob that you and Stan wanted him to
    only focus on two names? - I don't---no. DAVID: Okay. - Look,
    there's no way he could have gotten the impression before that
    meeting that we were trying to censor him. - I think maybe this
    would be a good moment to show you some things. BOIES: Sure, sure. -
    Yeah. - You'd mentioned that you'd seen some of the text messages
    between Stan--- - Well, I-I'm--- What I'm aware of is Stan's
    description of them to me. JESSICA: Ah, okay. Here. DAVID: We have
    them. Maybe that will help kind of clarify some things. - To be
    frank, they--- - Yeah. - This suggests to me some inconsistencies in
    what we've been talking about, but let's go through them because we
    want to hear your thoughts. - {[}stammering{]} Before---
    Don't---don't do that, okay? I mean, don't start talking about
    inconsistencies like that, because I don't think there's any
    inconsistency here. - Okay, well, but you haven't read these. - No,
    but there can't be any inconsistency with what I've told you. DAVID:
    Well, maybe--- - No, but listen to me, all right? Because what I've
    told you is what I did. There can't be any inconsistency between
    what I told you and what's in here `cause I didn't do this. - So
    maybe let's just go through some of this so we can just talk this
    out. So this is Stan laying out where you guys are gonna meet with
    Emily and Jacob. - Right. - And it says, ``I will meet you there at
    8:00 a.m. ``At 10:00, we will meet there with two reporters. ``Not a
    long meeting. ``You will be there simply to give cred to the source
    of info and certain subjects will be off-limits.'' So we had just
    asked you previously if there's any way Patrick might've gotten the
    impression that you guys were telling him to limit the information
    shared, and you said, no, there is not a way that he could've gotten
    the impression. - And that--- DAVID: So that strikes me as
    inconsistent. - No, no, well, I had had one conversation with him,
    and there was no way that he could've gotten that from that
    conversation. DAVID: Okay. BOIES: I didn't realize that there were
    text messages that had preceded that meeting. - So we next get to
    this page. - This is Stan talking? DAVID: Yes. JESSICA: Yes. - What
    is he responding to? - Patrick asked, ``How would this work?'' And
    Stan explains it. He lays out two hypotheticals. One is what he
    calls a standard model. - The second one I'm most interested in.
    BOIES: Yeah. - Because I've never seen anything like it before.
    DAVID: He says, ``No client is actually involved in this
    structure.'' You said earlier that there would be--- in any of these
    scenarios, there would be a client, and I'm curious how you square
    that with Stan saying, ``No client is actually involved in this
    structure.'' - Well, what he's laying it out to Patrick is a
    hypothetical, and I can tell you that it's a hypothetical that
    nobody ever did. This is somebody... who, the more I go through this
    stuff, looks to me here like he's trying to set Stan up. DAVID:
    We're eager for your interpretation of what the words on the page
    mean. - Are there text messages in between these two pages? - I
    don't know. BOIES: Okay. DAVID: We're not trying to build a legal
    case here. We're not trying to convince a jury. - No, I--- - But
    listen. We're trying to understand if there's a way to interpret
    this other than the way that it looks to us. - And what I'm saying
    is that these aren't my text messages, okay? - These are all the
    words of Stan Pottinger, who... - No, but--- - Was working with you.
    - Yes, but---but--- No, well, you keep saying that. Um... DAVID:
    That's what you said. - {[}stammering{]} Yes. Um, uh, but you keep
    implying that he's working with me on this. - Well, yeah, because we
    discussed this at the Harvard Club. - We did not discuss this at the
    Harvard Club. DAVID: Not in this level of detail, David, but we
    discussed--- - We did not discuss this at the Harvard Club. - Not in
    anything remotely resembling this detail but we very clearly
    discussed the plans to set up a foundation to have it get funded by
    abusers, and this is laying out in, I think, fairly clear detail the
    mechanics by which you guys were proposing to do that. And so,
    again, I'm interested--- please tell me how I'm wrong. - Well, for
    one thing you keep saying, ``You guys.'' I didn't write this text,
    and I haven't had a chance to talk to Stan about what he meant by
    it. - Patrick was uncomfortable with that because of what it would
    mean for the videos. He thought that it was essentially a way of
    burying the videos. BOIES: If you're bringing a settlement to
    somebody who you've got a claim against, they don't know what the
    evidence is until you show it to them. Once it's public, everybody
    knows about it. - And what's the problem with that? - Well, your
    leverage is gone. You don't have the ability to provide them with
    the information in the settlement that allows them to think they're
    getting something. DAVID: What would they be getting? - What they'd
    be getting is peace. People want to avoid litigation. They want to
    avoid the risks and uncertainties of going to a jury trial. - They
    often want to avoid damaging information like videos becoming
    public. - And they also want to avoid damaging information, no
    question about it. I think that although some of the language that I
    think Stan used was a little loose here, I think that if what he
    meant was that we want to control the information for the benefit of
    our clients, I think that is legitimate. \textless{}i\textgreater{}♪

    wanted to find out. \textless{}i\textgreater{}STAN: A settlement is
    a legal term that happens only, only,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}when you have a

    \textless{}i\textgreater{}and then you go to the lawyer for the

    {[}stammering{]} I will.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} EMILY: And what
    you say in that hypothetical is, ``We as lawyers approach a

    \textless{}i\textgreater{}STAN: I corrected that the next day, but
    keep going.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} DAVID: So who's the client in
    that situation, Stan? - Yeah, can you just explain to us what was
    going on there? `Cause... {[}stammering{]} It doesn't necessarily
    align with what you just were telling us.
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}STAN: I think it was exactly what I was
    telling you, and here's why.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}I went to a lawyer who structures these,
    and I said,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}``Is it possible to do--- is it possible
    and ethical?''\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}And he said, ``Yes, it happens all the

    you're also representing the women or the girls who said that
    they've been abused by those same men--- potentially the men on the
    hot list? \textless{}i\textgreater{}STAN: {[}stammers{]}
    \textless{}/i\textgreater{}- How does that work?
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}STAN:

    \textless{}i\textgreater{}The person who was violated is
    given...\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}her

    both the victim and her abuser? \textless{}i\textgreater{}STAN:
    {[}laughing{]} No.\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}You represent the
    victim,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}and

    says,\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}``I want
    you to be my lawyer going forward.''\textless{}/i\textgreater{} -
    You would go from representing a victim of abuse to representing the
    person who perpetrated that abuse? That feels good to you?
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}STAN: No, it's not--- it's not
    real.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} \textless{}i\textgreater{}It has
    nothing to do\textless{}/i\textgreater{}

    \textless{}i\textgreater{}The hypothetical two, which is
    hypothetical,\textless{}/i\textgreater{}
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}was done strictly to try to get him to
    send us the servers.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} DAVID: You said you
    were misleading him deliberately to get the servers, and I'm
    wondering if it's common practice for you or for lawyers in general
    to deliberately mislead potential witnesses.
    \textless{}i\textgreater{}STAN: I have no idea. Do
    you?\textless{}/i\textgreater{} EMILY: Well, have you done this

    Never.\textless{}/i\textgreater{} EMILY: So why now?

\textbf{Producer/Director} John Pappas

When a big bear of a man in flip-flops showed up with a bottle of
Japanese whiskey promising to deliver evidence implicating some of the
world's richest and most powerful men in an epic cover-up of sexual
misconduct, our reporters were hooked.

The man went by a pseudonym, Patrick Kessler, and he said he had
terabytes of video surveillance from Jeffrey Epstein's residences and
other materials that, if true, would validate theories Epstein was
engaged in an extensive blackmail operation. Kessler said he would share
it all with The New York Times.

As his outrageous story began to unravel, he illuminated something else:
how two of America's top lawyers considered using the promised trove of
Epstein information.

This special hourlong episode of ``The Weekly'' tells the wild story of
four Times reporters chasing one of the biggest stories of the year --
if only it were true. In the course of their reporting, they get a rare
glimpse into the secretive world of legal settlements in which wealthy
people are allowed to make damning evidence disappear.

\hypertarget{featured-reporters}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Featured
Reporters}}{Featured Reporters}}\label{featured-reporters}}

More than a dozen New York Times reporters have been investigating the
Jeffrey Epstein case, including several members of the Business desk,
led by \textbf{Ellen Pollock}. For this special episode of ``The
Weekly,'' the finance editor \textbf{David Enrich} and business
reporters \textbf{Jessica Silver-Greenberg} and \textbf{Emily Steel}
teamed up with \textbf{Jacob Bernstein} of the Styles desk to chase down
a too-good-to-be-true lead in the Epstein case.

\subsubsection{Our Reporters' Top 3
Takeaways}\label{our-reporters-top-3-takeaways}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{``Rich Man's Justice'' is alive and well.} The famous
  litigator David Boies has decried secret legal settlements in which
  wealthy men accused of abuse pay money in exchange for evidence of
  wrongdoing remaining private. But he and his associate John Stanley
  Pottinger were envisioning using supposed surveillance videos to
  secure settlements that, by both lawyers' acknowledgments, might have
  resulted in the videos staying secret.
\item
  \textbf{Lawyers go to extreme lengths to ingratiate themselves with
  witnesses.} Pottinger in particular pulled out the stops in pursuit of
  Patrick Kessler's cache. Pottinger took him out for chicken parmigiana
  and gave him a signed copy of one of his novels. He presented Kessler
  with a draft retention agreement that explained, in writing, how the
  lawyers might extract money from wealthy men associated with Epstein.
  Pottinger later told us that many of his overtures were lies meant to
  win over Kessler.
\item
  \textbf{The ghost of Jeffrey Epstein haunts us all.} Just like Boies
  and Pottinger, we were predisposed to believe Kessler's sensational
  story. Why? In part because we have been trying to figure out how
  Epstein surrounded himself with rich, powerful people, even after he
  was exposed as a sexual predator. Kessler's supposed trove might have
  provided an answer: Epstein was using damning video to extort the men
  in his circle.

  {[}MUSIC PLAYING{]} ``The story really began for us the day in July
  that Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and criminally charged with sex
  trafficking of minors.'' ``Suddenly he was someone we were thinking
  about. One of the big questions was, where his money was from?'' ``How
  does someone like that come up with hundreds of millions of dollars?''
  ``And we were tantalized by the fact that he seemed to have influence
  with a lot of powerful people.'' ``These weren't models and Hollywood
  people. These are some of the biggest names in business and finance.''
  ``They were Nobel Prize winners, Wall Street bigwigs.'' ``The list
  goes on and on. And we wanted to figure out why people had gravitated
  to him even after he had become known as a sexual predator.'' ``And
  then in September our reporters met a man who claimed to have a secret
  trove of information from Epstein's properties.'' ``This is someone
  who had extraordinary, probably unparalleled inside access, to not
  only Epstein, but Epstein's digital archive.'' ``If what the informant
  was saying was true, it had the potential to unlock Jeffrey Epstein's
  most important secrets.'' {[}MUSIC PLAYING{]}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Who Is Patrick
Kessler?}}{Who Is Patrick Kessler?}}\label{who-is-patrick-kessler}}

Among the many unusual things about this episode --- and our reporting
on this story --- is the fact that we regrettably still have no idea who
Patrick Kessler is. He seemed to appear out of the ether, and he
continues to reside there.

From the first time we met him, he insisted that he would not disclose
his identity. He agreed to sit for an on-camera interview --- but only
if we obscured his face. We generally don't grant anonymity to such
characters, but in this case we thought it was justified because it
would allow us to share his voice and physical outline with viewers.
Maybe you'll hear him and know who he is.

We pushed him, sometimes gently and sometimes aggressively, to tell us.
He always refused. He claimed to live within a three-hour radius of
Washington, D.C., but we don't know if that's three hours by plane,
train or car. Even if it's by foot it doesn't help much.

Many details he shared about his background didn't hold up after
fact-checking. Even his explanation for his motives seemed dishonest. In
the end, we can only guess why someone would make up an elaborate claim
about surveillance videos and spend many hours over the course of
several months engaging lawyers and journalists.

We're eager to hear your theories after you watch the episode.
