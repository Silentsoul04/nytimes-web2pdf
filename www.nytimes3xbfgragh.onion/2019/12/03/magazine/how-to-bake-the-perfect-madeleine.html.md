Early in my baking education, I bought a tinned-metal plaque with a
dozen shell-shaped indentations. It was an indulgent purchase, since the
pan was designed expressly to make just one pastry, a madeleine, a sweet
I had not only never baked but one I hadn’t even tasted. Over the years,
I’ve accumulated a stack of madeleine pans; the original plaque shares
cupboard space with nonstick, silicone and mini-madeleine pans too.
They’ve all seen plenty of use, but never more than recently: Since
September, when I met Cédric Grolet, I’ve made, I think, at least 200 of
the little teacakes. Come for dinner, and the odds are good that the
last morsel I’ll serve you will be a madeleine. A perfect madeleine.

Grolet, [named Best Pastry Chef in the
World](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/cedric-grolet-worlds-best-pastry-chef.html)
last year by the World’s 50 Best Restaurants group, is almost as well
known for his smile, playfulness and stylized tattoos as he is for the
stunning desserts he creates for Le Meurice hotel in Paris, where we
met. The day before, I went to his patisserie around the corner from the
hotel — he has since opened a large shop on the nearby Avenue de l’Opéra
— and bought a few of his specialties, many of which are finished only
when you order them, as they would be in a restaurant, so that all the
elements that are meant to be crackly or chewy or warm or cool have a
fighting chance of being just that when you settle down to eat them.

Among my stash was a pair of Grolet’s fruits, a lemon and a fig. Like
the 34-year-old chef’s million and a half other [followers on
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cedricgrolet/), I knew that when I
cut them, their *trompe l’oeil* shells would break with a crisp snap,
and there’d be a layer of cream and a tumble of fruit — cooked and
jammed — sliced in different sizes, offering different textures. The
Fabergé-like pastries, each tasting essentially like the fruits that
inspired them, reminded me of those Russian dolls that reveal something
new as each layer is lifted.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When I asked him about that cascade of flavors, Grolet said, completely
without artifice, “I’m a pastry chef, good is easy for me.” And then he
added that what he wanted was for his desserts to *déranger*, to astound
people. I’d experienced how his intricate pastries could disorient, but
I wondered if there were rules of *dérangement* for a home baker like
me. As he talked about his work, I made mental notes about simplicity:
Grolet uses the word “simple” to describe even his most complex
desserts; about focusing on a single flavor — remarkably, each of his
pastries is built on one flavor; about concentrating on ingredients,
taste and texture and letting these, rather than extraneous decorations,
make a dessert beautiful. It was when Grolet asked if I’d tasted his
madeleines that I knew he’d found a way for me to understand the
principles that guide him. And that’s how I went home committed to
madeleines, simplicity and
*dérangement*.

Madeleines are simple in every way, but one batch can be a master class
in baking. For starters, a madeleine has a specific look. You get the
lovely ribbed-shell shape with no effort — the pan dictates the form.
But the cake must be golden brown, and the shell side should have a
light crust — generously buttering the pan and dusting the interior with
flour gives you the crustiness. Then there’s the characteristic bump,
the counterbalance to the roly-poly shell. The bump can be a hillock or
an Everest; it depends on the recipe (this one has baking powder and the
power to bump high) and something called oven spring: get the batter
really cold; get the oven really hot; get a big bump.

In general, the flavor of madeleines is mild, and that’s true of the
Earl Grey madeleines that I’ve been perfecting. Their seductive flavor —
and their aroma — depend on a quartet of complementary ingredients: Earl
Grey tea (if you use a fine-quality loose tea rather than the powdery
leaves from a bag, you’ll have better flavor); citrus zest — Grolet uses
bergamot, the fruit that gives Earl Grey tea its distinctive flavor, but
it can be hard to find, so Meyer lemons or a lemon and a clementine can
stand in; honey; and browned butter. In French, brown butter is called
*beurre noisette*, hazelnut butter, and it’s a good name to remember as
you melt and color the butter for the madeleines. The butter is
fundamental to the flavor, and so you must cook it until it is
unequivocally brown and until you catch the whiff of hazelnuts. It will
have dark specks — they’re meant to be there, and they’re delicious.

Madeleines are essentially spongecakes, génoises to be specific, and the
key to obtaining a sublime sponge is patience and precision. It’s most
important that none of the ingredients be cold: the eggs must be room
temperature and the butter-honey mixture and the milk must be warm.
Think cozy equilibrium. The fact that the butter is stirred into the
batter at the end is unusual, but vital. Trust tradition here. Also
trust that the texture of your madeleines will be better — and the bump
bigger — if you give the batter a long rest in the refrigerator and use
it when it’s cold. Chilling the batter is convenient, too; with batter
in the fridge, it’s possible to make just a couple or an entire batch of
madeleines in minutes and to serve them warm.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And warm is key. The fragrance is most present, the texture is most
supple and the pleasures are most pronounced when the madeleines are
freshly baked. Grolet serves his teacakes within five minutes of their
coming from the oven. And I do, too. Like his, my simple, toasty, brown
madeleines are now a quiet *dérangement*.
