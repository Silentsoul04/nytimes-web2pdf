# Have We Finally Caught Up With Andrea Fraser?

For over 30 years, the artist has waged a conceptual battle against the
murky ethics of the art world. Now, finally, the larger culture is
taking cues from her.

IT WAS NEARLY closing time at the museum: Long shadows had already
devoured most of downtown Los Angeles and the hangar-like space was
hushed. [Andrea Fraser](https://www.art.ucla.edu/faculty/fraser.html)
stood before a small TV watching “Official Welcome,” one of her landmark
performances. Onscreen, she appeared in a tasteful black dress at the
opening of her 2003 exhibition in Hamburg, Germany, making remarks from
a lectern. She thanked the curators who had made her retrospective
possible; she thanked her mother, who had flown all the way from
California for the event. The crowd clapped on cue. But then the woman
went rogue, as though a computer virus had infected her gracious-artist
software. “Thank you, Andrea,” she boomed in a deep male voice, morphing
into the first of more than a dozen art-world personae who take over the
speech — a piratical dealer, a fawning patron, an artist best known for
pickling a shark. Before it’s over, she has shed her dress and then her
Gucci bra, thong and stilettos to address the audience fully nude. “It
takes a lot of courage to do what she does,” she said, assuming the
voice of an approving critic. “She goes far beyond where most artists
have the intelligence or audacity to operate.” The 30-minute piece —
funny, brash and often excruciating — ends after the woman, back in her
dress but somehow more exposed than ever, breaks down in sobs.

Tears pooled behind Fraser’s glasses as she watched her younger self.
But the moment passed quickly, and she returned to critiquing the work
on view, at the [Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary
Art](https://www.moca.org/visit/geffen-contemporary), with cleareyed
detachment. “I could have given that a little more time,” she said,
catching herself rush a beat.

“Official Welcome” is a case study in the intellectual rigor, physical
bravura and satirical wit Fraser brings to diagnosing the collective
delusions, material excesses, fraught politics, grandiose rhetoric,
bumptious egos, ingrained biases and sundry pretenses of the art world.
For the past 30 years, she has reigned unchallenged as the doyenne of
institutional critique, a branch of conceptual art concerned with the
internal machinery of museums and other social constructs. Lately, that
machinery has been the subject of intense public scrutiny. This year
alone, activists have stormed the exhibition halls of elite museums,
targeting their private funding sources. The Louvre [scrubbed the

and the [Metropolitan Museum of

and

the U.S.-Mexico border.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Fraser is a fierce critic of the status quo, but her approach is
different from that of most artist-activists. For most of her career,
she has fused archival research, psychoanalysis, sexuality and humor in
diverse projects that examine the art world’s subconscious — the web of
desires that shape its economy, power dynamics and social relationships
— and her own place within the system. In 2001, she spoofed the museum
world’s fetish for glitzy new buildings by grinding sensuously against
the curvaceous limestone walls of the [Frank
Gehry](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/frank-gehry)-designed
Guggenheim Bilbao, her acid-green dress hiked up around her waist,
driven to ecstasy by the audio guide. Two years later, she filmed a
sexual encounter with a collector to create her most notorious work,
“Untitled,” a piece some praise as the ultimate comment on art as
empty commerce and others dismiss as an attention-grabbing stunt.

Fraser’s occasional bouts of nudity often eclipse her careful choice of
costumes, reflecting a savvy that extends to her civilian life — clothes
are the only belongings Fraser accumulates other than books. They are
props people use to perform themselves, and Fraser’s eye for the subtle
ways that they broadcast self-assurance or camouflage fragility helps
give her work its bite. In the language of her art, clothes serve as
verbs — active and dynamic forces. Her outfit at the Geffen that hot day
in late September — a floral jumpsuit, suede mustard-colored mules and
violet toenail polish — delivered a jaunty riposte to the little black
dress she wore in the video. Fraser swears at parking meters like a New
Yorker (she was based in the city for 25 years) and rhapsodizes about
gardening like the Los Angeles transplant she has become (she’s lived
there since 2006 and currently shares a home in the San Fernando Valley
with her husband, Andy Stewart, and their toy poodles, Winnicott and
Bowlby).

All of Fraser’s works combine a trenchant and unsparing intellect with a
magnetic physical presence. She stands with the alert posture of a
dancer and passes through the world with the kind of fluid, feline
awareness that makes it difficult to imagine her tripping or dropping
her keys. At 54, her face is practically unlined. Intently impassive
when she is listening to others, her features fly into motion when she
is discussing matters close to her heart, from psychoanalytic theory to
samba dancing. Listening to Fraser speak in the measured timbre of a
veteran academic, as she often does, is a bit like listening to an opera
singer softly hum a tune — it can be suspenseful, knowing just how much
power she is capable of unleashing, how much voltage is being kept under
control.

In “Official Welcome,” Fraser’s physical powers are on full display as
she stomps and strips and mimics the gestures of recognizable art-world
figures. (For the script, Fraser culled excerpts from actual speeches
and interviews, seamlessly melding them with her own writing.) “You
know, it’s fun to sell big artworks — and it’s profitable. In the end, a
good artist is a rich artist,” she bellows as she swaggers across the
stage as an unmistakable heavyweight dealer. Minutes later, she morphs
again: “Most of the work we collect is about sex or excrement,” she
chirps in the perky tone of a prominent West Coast collector. “We like
to think of ourselves as connoisseurs of art’s subculture.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The art world is easy to roast — its most absurd characters are often
the most oblivious — and it tends to skewer itself without any outside
assistance. But Fraser’s work is not mere polemics or parody. She bares
her own insecurities as she examines those of museums, galleries,
viewers and patrons. “Official Welcome” may mock the art world’s rituals
of florid praise and faux humility, but the performance also reflects
Fraser’s lifelong sense of being an outsider — a position she
consciously draws upon in her work. “Yeah, it was fun to write,” she
said, “but to some extent, this piece was driven by my sense of
resentment and envy of my professional peers about whom all these great
things were said.” To Fraser, this sort of vulnerability and
self-examination is crucial if a work is going to engage viewers. “Art
functions through empathy. … \[When you\] see someone else who’s
struggling with something and grappling with something, that creates a
space for finding that in yourself,” she said. For her, these
performances are not idle exercises but dogged attempts to change
audiences and the larger ecosystems they inhabit. And, if the events of
the past year are any indication, these provocations have worked — even
if most audiences don’t fully realize that the world has caught up to
Andrea Fraser.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“WHAT DO YOU need to know about me to understand my work?” Fraser asked
six of her graduate students. It was the first day of fall classes at
the University of California, Los Angeles, where Fraser is a tenured
professor in the Department of Art. They sat in a half circle in a stark
white room illuminated by the eye of a large projector. Fraser, in a
black dress and multicolor Issey Miyake scarf, was explaining early
sources of her critical approach, and the lecture had the riveting,
unpredictable atmosphere of one of her performances. “That I was the
youngest in a family of five,” she continued. “It was extremely
competitive, and fairness became extremely important to me from that
position. I had to defend my little share, right? My little piece of the
pie.” Her obsession with equity, she said, again tearing up, partly
“comes down to that, to being the runt.”

Fraser was born in Montana in 1965 and grew up on the West Coast. Her
parents married two months after they met in New York, where her father,
the son of a cattle rancher, was studying philosophy at Columbia
University and her Puerto Rican-born mother was taking painting classes
at the Art Students League. The family moved to the Bay Area in 1967.
“Pretty quickly, the context of Berkeley began to unravel the family,”
Fraser later told me, over a tray of chicken and rice at a tiny Jamaican
spot in Culver City. “We became hippies very quickly, my mother got
involved in the women’s movement, became a lesbian a bit before that. My
brothers, I think, were selling drugs when they were 10, 11? We were all
pretty precocious.”

The artist grew up memorizing [Adrienne
Rich](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/03/29/books/adrienne-rich-feminist-poet-and-author-dies-at-82.html)
poems, browsing “Our Bodies, Ourselves” and crafting banners for gay
pride marches in her mother’s kitchen. She remembers cutting class and
catching a bus into San Francisco to see [Judy
Chicago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/07/t-magazine/judy-chicago-dinner-party.html)’s
major feminist installation “The Dinner Party” at the age of 13. Two
years later, she quit going to school altogether (her mother wrote her a
note) and made her way to New York’s East Village, where she applied to
the School of Visual Arts.

While she waited on her acceptance, Fraser visited the Met three or four
times a week. “I was pretty freaked out about having dropped out of high
school and what was going to happen to me,” she said. “I had to sort of
redeem myself.” Soon, Fraser knew most of the museum by heart, from the
lavish period rooms to the Greek and Roman marbles. She was attracted to
“East Coast cultural institutions and status codes,” despite feeling, or
precisely because she felt, “deeply illegitimate — as a high school
dropout, as a hippie kid, as a half-Puerto Rican kid … I think I was
able, from the very beginning, to recognize, even if I couldn’t use the
words ‘ambivalence’ or ‘conflicted investments,’” she said, assuming a
deep professorial register to mock her own preferred terms, “how much I
wanted from these institutions … and that I could find a kind of
legitimacy in that world. And, at the same time, I did feel absolutely
crushed by
it.”

## For Fraser, her performances are not idle exercises but dogged attempts to change audiences and the larger ecosystems they inhabit.

At S.V.A., Fraser found her tribe: a group of young artists, including
[Mark Dion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/mark-dion),
[Tom
Burr](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/13/t-magazine/site-specific-art.html),
Gregg Bordowitz and Collier Schorr, who gathered around Craig Owens, the
art critic and gay activist, among other postmodernist teachers. Fraser
stood out from the start. “Andrea was scary brilliant,” said Bordowitz,
who became Fraser’s boyfriend. “Frighteningly brilliant, very
intimidating. And at the same time, very fragile, because I think she
even scared herself sometimes with what she saw and understood about the
art world and its terrible contradictions.” At 18, Fraser left S.V.A.
for the Whitney Independent Study Program, then a theory-intensive boot
camp. There, she studied with the artist Barbara Kruger, whose work
critiques systems of power and control and the cultures they create.
(They now teach together at U.C.L.A.) Kruger praised Fraser’s
“incredibly brilliant mind,” but Fraser saw herself quite differently.
“At the Whitney program, my image of myself was that I was just, like,
hiding under the seminar table in fear,” she said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

BEFORE FRASER CAME along, institutional critique was the domain of
older, mostly male European artists who had launched the movement in the
late 1960s amid the protests sweeping the Western world. In 1969,
activists wrestled in a pool of bovine blood inside the lobby of the
Museum of Modern Art to censure two trustees, Nelson and [David
Rockefeller](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/20/business/david-rockefeller-dead-chase-manhattan-banker.html),
who had wartime manufacturing ties to jet fighters and napalm. The
German artist Hans Haacke made these demands for accountability his very
practice by presenting a mordant installation in an exhibition at the
museum the following year. His piece, “[MoMA
Poll](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/15/t-magazine/most-important-contemporary-art.html),”
asked viewers to drop ballots into boxes to indicate whether Nelson’s
failure to denounce President Nixon’s Indochina policy would be grounds
for them to vote against him (he was up for re-election as governor of
New York). By the end of the exhibition, nearly twice as many
participants had answered yes than no. Haacke’s project reflected the
broader anti-establishment ethos of the time, but he and the other
architects of institutional critique, including the Belgian artist
Marcel Broodthaers and the French conceptualist [Daniel
Buren](https://www.lissongallery.com/artists/daniel-buren), were also
reacting to a specific transformation in the history of museums and the
art world at large.

If the old museum was a mausoleum safeguarding dusty treasures for the
enjoyment of the educated few, the new museum that emerged in the 1960s
and ’70s courted broad audiences with blockbuster shows, expensive
advertising campaigns, new wings, after-hours events and gift shops. The
methods of [Thomas
Hoving](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/thomas-hoving),
the freewheeling director of the Met between 1967 and 1977, exemplified
the tactics museums began deploying to ratchet up their attendance and
revenue. A 1969 multimedia exhibition titled “Harlem on My Mind,” for
instance, was unabashedly intended, Hoving wrote in his 1993
autobiography, “to chronicle the creativity of the downtrodden blacks
and, at the same time, encourage them to come to the museum.”

This was also, and not coincidentally, the moment when the contemporary
art market exploded. As early as 1960, the dealer Peggy Guggenheim was
lamenting how “the entire art movement has become an enormous business
venture.” Collectors, she wrote, were spending “unheard-of” sums “merely
for investment, placing pictures in storage without even seeing them,
phoning their gallery every day for the latest quotation as though they
were waiting to sell stock.” This approach became a method in 1973, the
year a New York-based collector named [Robert
Scull](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1986/01/03/obituaries/robert-scull-prominent-collector-of-pop-art.html)
flipped 50 works by American artists for $2.3 million (about $12 million
in today’s dollars) that he had bought several years earlier for
$150,000 (about $860,000). These figures seem minuscule by today’s
standards, but the sale nonetheless announced a new era: the age of art
collecting as investment strategy. As museums chased mainstream
audiences, they assumed a paradoxical role as the seemingly moral
counterparts to the marketplace — temples to art untainted by dollar
signs — but were hardly immune to the wealth reshaping the industry as
they pursued funding streams for high-profile expansions and big-ticket
exhibitions.

Fraser wove her predecessors’ critical threads into her own practice but
with two key differences: None of the early practitioners of
institutional critique had used his own body as his primary medium, or
acknowledged his own stake (emotional, economic or otherwise) in the
systems he examined. Fraser made herself the site of her art and
explored her own fragility in the process, effectively redefining the
genre. “I think phrases like ‘institutional critique’ can have the whiff
of academic theory,” said [Scott
Rothkopf](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/03/arts/design/for-scott-rothkopf-a-swift-ascendance-in-the-whitney-hierarchy.html),
the chief curator of the Whitney, “and one of the things that makes her
work so important is that the clarity and the depth and the rigor of her
thought is matched by tremendous emotional breadth.” Fraser emerged from
the Whitney program armed with strategies plucked from feminist
performance, postmodern theory and psychoanalysis that she used to form
a fresh, hybrid approach. Her great innovation was a “radical empathy,”
said Connie Butler, the chief curator of the [Hammer
Museum](https://hammer.ucla.edu/) in Los Angeles. Fraser can, and is
willing to, probe “difficult, complex issues” by fully assuming diverse,
and sometimes repellent, voices and positions. “I can’t think of anyone
else who does that,” she said. By inhabiting the figures and roles
Fraser saw as legitimate, she also discovered a means of negotiating her
own fraught participation in the systems they represent. “It was an
artistic strategy, but it was also a life strategy,” Fraser said.

Her big break came in 1989, when she was invited to give a lecture at
the [Philadelphia Museum of Art](https://philamuseum.org/) and proposed
a subversive performance instead. Leading the camera through the august
galleries, Fraser (in the guise of a ladylike docent named Jane
Castelton) shifts seamlessly between lofty praise for the masterpieces
on display (“resplendently amazingly flawless”) and the museum itself
(“a place apart from the mundane demands of reality” that provides “a
training in taste”) to grim accounts of the squalid poorhouses that
appeared in America at the same time that the country’s oldest art
museums were being established (“The inmates are lodged in rooms of
about 22 feet by 45 feet … and are classed according to their general
habits and characteristics, separating the more deserving from the
abandoned and worthless”). The video, which is roughly 30 minutes long,
is a disturbing, spellbinding portrait of a country whose long history
of inequality haunts its cultural institutions. At the time that Fraser
made “Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk,” that inequality was
approaching its present levels. Reagan- and Bush-era cuts to cultural
funding meant that museums increasingly had to seek corporate
sponsorship and private donors. Fraser’s piece ostensibly targeted the
robber-baron philanthropy of the Gilded Age, but she was also
implicating museums’ current embrace of free-market capitalism.

Soon, Fraser was participating in prestigious biennials and working with
a New York dealer, [Colin de
Land](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/03/06/arts/colin-de-land-47-art-dealer-who-fostered-experimentation.html).
(Later, in 2002, she started showing at
[Petzel](http://www.petzel.com/), a larger New York gallery.) But
participating in the gallery world sat uneasily with Fraser, who
continued to dissect its systems from the inside. She produced her
videos in unlimited editions, undermining their value as rarefied
commodities, and occasionally renounced making salable objects
altogether. “I’ve been in and out of strategies of trying to manage my
conflicted feelings about the market, about selling art,” Fraser told
me. She then shook her head, a little amused, perhaps, by the
self-inflicted agony of her struggle against a commercial sphere in
which countless artists are glad, even grateful, to exist at all.

ONE OF FRASER’S (many) problems with the art world is that relationships
are rarely genuine, and much of her work deals with questions of
authenticity. Artists, dealers and patrons often “perform” fictional
friendships, she said, “but fundamentally, they’re transactional.”
Fraser described collectors who believed certain artists and dealers
were their friends, only to get hurt when they hit a rough patch and
couldn’t afford to keep buying. “That’s not something I want to
participate in,” she said.

She mined her conflicted feelings about the market to create “Untitled,”
which, to the artist’s exasperation, is often seen as her defining work.
In the video, Fraser has sex with a collector, who prepurchased a copy
of the recording. Shot from a single camera mounted near the ceiling of
a New York hotel room, the unedited footage shows Fraser greet the
unidentified man and offer him a glass of wine. They appear to talk a
little (there is no audio), and then they undress, sleep together and
talk some more. The piece avoids pornographic clichés — there are no
close-ups; it’s as though the encounter had been secretly filmed by a
security camera. The whole thing takes an hour. “You see, like, a
penis\!” Fraser exclaimed, baffled by the scandalized reactions that
“Untitled” continues to inspire. “You see a teeny, tiny, little speck
for about two seconds like three times. You see boobs.”

When the video went on display at Petzel in 2003, the work shocked the
art world. The press was harsh. There were gratuitous comments on
Fraser’s appearance — Jerry Saltz noted in Artnet Magazine that Fraser
is “in excellent shape for a 39 year old” and “gives an attentive blow
job.” “I think some people felt that the piece was almost too literal
and didn’t have the complexities of some of her other performances, and
I think she felt very misunderstood,” said Tom Burr. “There’s an
emotional, personal side to it, where you get battered and hurt by all
of these kinds of conditions that you’re trying to speak about. You
still want to be liked.”

Fraser considered the backlash a compliment to the work. “For me, one of
the clearest signs that ‘Untitled’ is a successful piece is that it
didn’t only upset people outside of the art world but a lot of people
inside the art world as well,” she told [The Brooklyn
Rail](https://brooklynrail.org/2004/10/art/andrea-fraser) the following
year. Today, she’ll admit that the experience was harrowing, mostly
because the price the collector paid became an obsession for viewers.
For Fraser, the amount was symbolic, which is why she will never
disclose it; the piece was about the desires and fantasies that drive
artists, patrons and dealers to collude in a market that reduces art to
a transaction and a meditation on the experience of selling intimate
parts of one’s self. “Untitled” can be read as a comment on the
exploitation artists suffer at the hands of profiteering collectors and
opportunistic dealers, but ironically, Fraser was worried about the
patron. “I had a tremendous amount of power in that piece,” she said. “I
used to joke it started out as a prostitution piece and could become an
extortion piece — I have a videotape of a man having sex in a hotel room
with a woman who’s not his wife.” But the price, which was widely,
incorrectly, reported as $20,000, overwhelmed any considerations of
Fraser’s agency. “So that’s what was the most painful for me,” said
Fraser, “being exposed publicly in the art economy as cheap.”

The experience was alienating in other ways as well. In the two years
Fraser spent formulating “Untitled” and exhibiting it at Petzel, she
remembers only two people asking her about the work directly. “And this
was a period when I would hear secondhand that people were having heated
arguments about it, everybody was talking about it. Nobody talked to me
about it.” One of the paradoxes of “Untitled,” she said, is that while
it is, in part, about intimacy, “the experience of doing it was
incredibly
isolating.”

## The United States, Fraser writes, has become a plutocracy, and its museums have effectively become pay-to-play country clubs for millionaires.

“Untitled” occupies an uneasy place in the contemporary canon. On one
hand, it followed in a long tradition of radical feminist performance
and video art that includes the late [Carolee
Schneemann](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/31/t-magazine/feminist-artists-judith-bernstein-betty-tompkins.html)’s
“Fuses” of 1964-67, a montage of the artist and her husband having sex,
shot from the perspective of their cat, and [Martha
Rosler](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/14/t-magazine/martha-rosler.html)’s
footage of a male doctor measuring and clinically reporting the
dimensions of her naked hips, limbs and breasts in “[Vital Statistics of
a Citizen, Simply
Obtained](http://www.vdb.org/titles/vital-statistics-citizen-simply-obtained),”
from 1977. Women had long used their bodies to critique social relations
and hierarchies, but the fact that so much of Fraser’s work had existed
within an intellectual framework, steeped in discourse and terminology,
meant that no one really knew how to contextualize her more explicit use
of her sexuality. By 2003, critics and audiences alike had essentially
decided that women artists could use their bodies, or they could use
their brains. Fraser never felt that she had to choose between the two.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

These days, Fraser warns her students against including five kinds of
content in their art — cute animals, babies and young children, popular
music, sex and certain kinds of violence — because they tend to
overwhelm viewers’ ability to think about art in nuanced or complex
ways. She acknowledges the consequences of breaking her own rule.
“Artists are responsible, I believe, on some level for … what their
work activates in other people,” she said. “And so on some level, I’m
responsible for the responses — to ‘Untitled’ and to other works of mine
— that I abhor.”

What continues to unsettle people about “Untitled” isn’t the sex, though
— the art world likely lost that last bit of innocence in 1991, when
[Jeff
Koons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/17/t-magazine/east-village-artist-jeff-koons-peter-halley.html)
exhibited a series of graphic works portraying himself in flagrante
delicto with his porn-star wife — it’s that the piece calls out
art-world commerce for what it is: commerce, plain and simple. People in
almost any industry would prefer not to dwell on the transactional basis
of their relationships with others, but that’s what Fraser asked her
peers to join her in doing when she took up the old metaphor of artist
as prostitute, and implicated everyone involved: the dealer as pimp, the
collector as john, the viewer as voyeur. The work threatened the high
self-opinion of the art world, which rarely questions its own integrity.
Fraser tried, however bluntly, to tear down pretense and expose the ways
in which intimacy is performed. In the end, it was the piece that got
torn
apart.

BY 2006, FRASER was on the brink of quitting. “I was really fed up,” she
said. “I was fed up with the art world, but I was also fed up with being
poor and being broke and being in debt and struggling to live in my own
apartment in New York.” She was considering pursuing a Ph.D. in
anthropology when salvation came in the form of U.C.L.A., where she has
taught for the past 13 years. Tenure alleviated the financial strain of
operating outside the commercial art world. She cut ties with Petzel in
2011 and never signed with another American gallery. But Fraser’s work
has always made more sense in museums, her contentious muses —
especially now as these institutions reinvent themselves all over again.

Today, museums are scrambling to redefine the canon and compensate, as
much as they can, for centuries of exclusion with a surge in exhibitions
devoted to women and artists of color. Tokenism and hollow attempts at
mere correctness abound, but so do real revelations, as every exhibition
season brings overlooked artists to light and recognizes neglected
icons: Most recently, a remodeled MoMA opened its fall season with shows
by two black artists, the 64-year-old performance maverick
[Pope.L](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/02/t-magazine/pope-l-artist.html)
and the pioneering assemblage artist [Betye
Saar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/04/arts/design/betye-saar.html),
who, at age 93, was also getting her first solo show at the museum. For
these overdue efforts to continue, and for museums to ensure that they,
as institutions, remain relevant to contemporary audiences (in more
profound ways than as selfie backdrops), curatorial and staff diversity
is essential. In New York, diversity reporting has become requisite for
museums to receive city funding. Trustee diversity remains elusive,
however. A [2017
study](https://www.aam-us.org/2018/01/19/museum-board-leadership-2017-a-national-report/)
commissioned by the American Alliance of Museums found that 46 percent
of all American museum boards are 100 percent white. Meanwhile,
institutions’ acceptance of questionable money hasn’t changed much since
Haacke’s day. The inherent hypocrisy of museums — as protectors of
culture, funded by the very people compromising that culture’s values —
is increasingly unacceptable to audiences. This is a transitional
moment, and it isn’t yet clear what museums might become, only that they
are changing. As galleries increasingly display work representing a
breadth of backgrounds, boardrooms are the last parts of the museum in
need of urgent reconsideration.

Recently, Fraser’s analysis of museum governance has become more
explicitly political. When Steven Mnuchin, a trustee of MOCA in Los
Angeles at the time,
[became](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/10/business/dealbook/donald-trumps-pick-for-fund-raiser-is-rife-with-contradictions.html)
the national finance chairman for the Trump campaign, Fraser began to
wonder what the politics of other museum patrons really were. The result
was a 950-page study titled “[2016 in Museums, Money, and
Politics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/2016).” The book breaks down
the donations of 5,458 museum board members to party-aligned
organizations during the general election. Fraser was horrified, she
said, by the realization that people who supported institutions
professing diversity and equality could simultaneously fund candidates
with conservative positions on issues like immigration. ([Steven
Cohen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/steven-cohen),
the billionaire hedge-fund manager who sits on the board of MOCA and
MoMA, for instance, gave an estimated $6,793,500 to Republican causes —
including Paul Ryan’s congressional campaign — in 2016 and in the first
half of the 2018 midterm election cycle.) “She uncovered the false
notion that museums are Democratic,” said Cuauhtémoc Medina, the chief
curator of the [University Museum of Contemporary
Art](https://muac.unam.mx/acerca-de-nosotros?lang=en) in Mexico City,
who organized Fraser’s 2016 exhibition there. “She discovered that we’re
in serious trouble.” But Fraser came away from the project convinced
that the bigger issue is that the super rich — political affiliations
aside — run the country. The United States, she writes, has become a
plutocracy, and its museums have effectively become pay-to-play country
clubs for millionaires.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Critics of the book tend to state that Fraser “doesn’t offer solutions”
or “doesn’t go far enough.” And while she doesn’t propose specific
reforms, she has been busy pursuing answers to the problems that have
underscored her practice. She believes, for instance, that museums need
to democratize internally, and would benefit from artist, staff and
community councils with board representatives. She has sought these
roles herself. “I’m on three boards and two councils, so it feels like
I’ve gone to seed or something,” she said. “But it’s sort of the part
of the evolution of what I do and institutional critique — realizing
that you also have to step up.” She believes collection artists should
call “not just for a protest, but for a meeting” with the board members
and staff of the museums that hold their work, to discuss how boards
might come to include more people who are not “defined by their wealth.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the wake of recent protests — including one in October at the new
MoMA’s opening party where people picketed an entrance over the board
member Larry Fink, whose company invests in private prisons in the
country on behalf of its clients — other museums are anticipating their
own day of reckoning. “You can’t possibly know everything about where
every cent of every donor’s money is invested,” said Butler, the chief
curator of the Hammer, where Fraser sits on the artist council. At a
moment when more boycotts seem inevitable, Fraser has become one of the
artists that museum people will occasionally call to get off-the-record
advice on difficult issues — including where, or how, to draw a line
when it comes to patronage. “We have to think differently about who our
supporters are and where those funding streams come from,” said Butler.
Previously, when it came to accepting donations, “the line seemed to be
like, unless you could prove criminality and murder, you would take the
money, you know? I think the fact that we’re having a more nuanced
discussion about this has a lot to do with the research that Andrea has
done.”

NOW THAT HER study is finished, Fraser is preparing two new
performances, including a museum tour — her first since 1991 — for the
[Art Institute of Chicago](https://www.artic.edu/). She had been invited
to do a tour there but didn’t have a hook until she began thinking back
to her earlier work. In 2016, Fraser created an [audio
installation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/28/arts/design/the-whitney-will-be-alive-with-the-sounds-of-sing-sing.html)
at the Whitney’s recently opened building in Lower Manhattan on the
Hudson River, playing sounds she had recorded in a cell block of Sing
Sing Correctional Facility 32 miles north. That piece, as well as her
early reflections on poorhouses, was on her mind when she found a focus:
“Prisons are the new poorhouses,” she said. The tour might limn the
unlikely parallels between museums, which encourage transgression, and
prisons, which punish it. Since the 1970s, the number of both
institutions has tripled in the United States.

Another new performance, this one for the Hammer, may involve Fraser
assuming an array of disparate voices with the chameleonic prowess she
brought to “Official Welcome.” As we left the Geffen, we passed the
monitor playing that ferocious piece one last time. Fraser originally
thought she would still be performing “Official Welcome” at 60 and that,
as she continued to shed that Gucci thong, the aging of her body would
become part of the work — a means of confronting the way the art world
deals, or doesn’t, with older female artists. But the last time Fraser
performed the vitriolic monologue was in 2012. By then, her position had
changed, and even she had to admit she had secured a spot in
contemporary art Valhalla. “Performing it,” she said, “just began to
feel kind of sour and ungracious.”

Watching it, though, is still a poignant experience, partly because
Fraser doesn’t want to give up on the art world, no matter how
disagreeable it gets. “I want to believe that it means something,” she
said, as she opened the door to the warm California air. “It’s something
that I hold on to, testing the art world to be true to my hopes for it.”
