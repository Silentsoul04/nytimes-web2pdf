As the chef and co-owner of the pioneering Hudson Valley farm-to-table
restaurant [Blue Hill at Stone
Barns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/05/11/t-magazine/blue-hill-stone-barns-sothebys-gallery.html),
Dan Barber is besieged by artisans trying to collaborate with him. But
one day, in the spring of 2015, he heard from a Pennsylvania ceramist
named [Gregg Moore](http://www.greggfmoore.com/) and instantly knew that
this call was different. “He started talking to me in a way that I
hadn’t heard anybody who designs anything — especially plateware —
talk to me,” Barber says. “Just asking me, not in an accusatory way, ‘If
you’re thinking about food and the way it’s grown and raised and
everything that goes into the creation of a plate, why are you not
thinking about the plate itself?’”

Together, the chef and potter conceived the purest distillation of the
farm’s whole-animal philosophy: china made from the bones of its own
cows. Barber would raise the cows on pasture, as always, and after
slaughtering them for meat, he’d give the bones (mostly femurs, their
marrow consumed) to Moore, who would transform them into tableware. The
finished china, which comes in three pieces — a plate, a bowl and a
water cup — is so light and white that it seems to float. When it became
the restaurant’s default table setting earlier this year, guests
couldn’t keep their hands off it. “Everyone immediately grabs the
plate and touches it, looks at it, turns it around,” says Philippe
Gouze, the restaurant’s director of operations. “It’s an instant
attraction.”

Moore, 44, the son of a New Jersey butcher, is a visual and performing
arts professor at Arcadia University, outside Philadelphia, and a
rigorous student of his craft. His bone china recipe traces back to the
one formulated circa 1799 by Josiah Spode, the godfather of [British
porcelain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1992/02/16/travel/in-the-cradle-of-english-china.html).
Beginning in the mid-18th century, European ceramists attempted to
replicate smooth porcelain from China (hence the name), which had been
invented over a thousand years prior. The English artist Thomas Frye
first experimented with bone ash — the remnants after water, fat and
connective tissue are burned off — before Spode fine-tuned the process,
creating a durable but delicate product. “What differentiates bone china
from all other ceramic materials is that it’s made out of an element
that was once living,” Moore says. “So it has the ability to express, if
we look carefully enough, the quality of life of that living entity.”
Since Blue Hill cows roam freely, for instance, their bones are
stronger, which allows Moore to fire his wares at higher temperatures,
lending them a creamy translucency.

Moore retrieves buckets of bones from Blue Hill after Barber’s team has
cleaned them by boiling them in a stockpot for several hours. At this
stage, they are a ruddy mahogany and may still carry a slight bovine
odor. Back in his studio, Moore boils them again, then fires them in a
gas kiln, which removes any remaining organic material and transforms
the living tissue into pure calcium phosphate. He mixes the ash with
water in a ball mill, which rotates to create a kind of sludge. From
there, he dries the slurry, pulverizes it into powder, combines it with
more water and two other minerals from Spode’s method — kaolin and
Cornish stone — and then molds the pieces and flash-fires them in an
oxidized electric kiln at about 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit. While his
plates and bowls come in relatively conventional circular shapes, the
cups warp from the heat: One might look like a kidney bean, another a
Modernist bathtub.

Given that Blue Hill dinners can last well over three hours and comprise
some 30 different dishes, those cups have taken on outsize importance.
(“If you think about the tabletop,” Moore says, “what’s the one object
that remains the entire meal?”) And yet his other pieces speak more
directly to the creatures that begot them: The plates hold pats of
butter churned from the udder of a single cow; the bowls cradle a
sweetened custard made from their milk. “My work, when it leaves the
studio, is not done,” Moore says. “It’s just started. Its life is on the
table and in the kitchen.”
