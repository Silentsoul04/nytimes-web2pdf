Michelle Pfeiffer began collecting antique perfume bottles three years
ago, while developing \href{https://henryrose.com/}{Henry Rose}, the
fragrance line she launched last spring. ``As I learned more about the
history of perfume, I became fascinated with the design of old
bottles,'' says the actor, whose new brand includes five scents ---
among them, Fog, a blend of musk and vetiver, and Jake's House, a mix of
honey and neroli --- all of which are free of endocrine-disrupting
phthalates and other harmful synthetics often found in eaux de parfum.
Some of Pfeiffer's collection of mostly early- and mid-20th-century
vials have intricate etchings, while others are gilded like an Art Deco
skyscraper. ``Fragrance bottles aren't really designed that way
anymore,'' says the 61-year-old, who finds them online or at antique
shops in her hometown, Los Angeles. ``They live on my vanity in my
dressing room. I imagine who owned them before and what kind of scents
they contained,'' she says. Pfeiffer's latest film, ``French Exit,''
directed by Azazel Jacobs and co-starring
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/03/movies/lucas-hedges-ben-is-back.html}{Lucas
Hedges}, is due in theaters in 2020.

Glass and metal vessel. ``I gravitated toward this one's minimal
profile. I hadn't seen a bottle quite like this before. The metal
closure is a detail you don't often find on more modern fragrance
bottles.''

Glass and brass vessel. ``I love the cap and visible hardware on this
otherwise simple bottle. It almost reminds me of armor, which is
sometimes how I think about fragrance --- as my coat of armor for the
day.''

Etched glass vessel. ``The shape of this bottle reminds me of an
architectural dome. The bee design is so whimsical. I imagine a light,
clean-smelling fragrance once lived in it. I found this one online, and
it's one of my favorites.''

Painted glass vessel. ``The retro feel of this bottle, from the stripes
to the colors, makes me think it was from the '60s or '70s. I've always
been somewhat of a hippie when it comes to the notes I'm most drawn to,
like patchouli and musk, so this bottle felt like the perfect complement
to my collection.''

Glass and silver vessel. ``I love the detailed handiwork of the cap and
how vibrant the crimson color is. It almost looks like a stained-glass
window in a church.''

Glass and metal vessel. ``I love the sensuality of this bottle's
rose-shaped cap. I didn't have any flowers in my yard growing up, so I
would walk through the neighborhood picking roses to try to make my own
perfume. That was my first foray into the world of fragrance, and this
bottle brings back those memories.''
