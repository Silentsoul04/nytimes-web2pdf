# Jacqueline Woodson on Africa, America and Slavery’s Fierce Undertow

</div>

The African-American novelist journeys to Ghana, once a hub of the
trans-Atlantic slave trade, as the nation invites descendants of
enslaved Africans to call it their “home.” But can you go home again?

**IN THE COASTAL TOWN** of Elmina, Ghana, the Atlantic Ocean crashes
against the rocks with such a ferocity, I make our kids move back away
from the gray-blue water. Four hundred years have passed since captured
Africans were forced across these waves on their way to bondage in the
New World and now, standing at the edge of this violent water, startled
by my own anxiety, I feel something deep and old and terrifying. Call it
hydrophobia. Call it genetic memory. I’ve always had a fear of the
ocean, the fierce pull of its undercurrent, the crest of its powerful
waves and most of all, its seeming infinity — the way it moves to a
place where the skyline caresses it. Then drops off into nothing at all.

As the water lashes near where I stand in this West African nation, from
whose ports millions of Africans passed through on their way to the
United States, Latin America and the Caribbean, it is impossible to not
viscerally *feel* this memory everywhere in my body. Not far from here,
captured Africans walked onto slave ships.

I call again to my children. Tell them to be careful. What I want to do
right now is pull them close, hug them hard. I think of the people
chained and trembling and I know that by the luck of history and by the
grace of time, I am standing here, unshackled.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, Ghana has invited the descendants of the enslaved to a place it
wants us to call “home.” While Ghana is not the first sub-Saharan
country from which Africans were forced onto ships, many black bodies,
including my own ancestors, were sold and traded from here. In its
efforts to bring the African diaspora together, Ghana’s leaders are also
hoping to make amends for the complicity of Africans in selling their
own people into what would become the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

**GHANA’S INVITATION** is wrapped up in a massive marketing campaign
called “[Year of Return](https://www.yearofreturn.com/).” The
commemoration is described as a “landmark spiritual and birth-right
journey,” urging black folks to seek out our roots, invest in this
country, and to educate our children on African soil. This year, there
have been festivals, concerts, workshops and other events to mark 400
years since the arrival of the first captured Africans in the English
colony of Virginia. But even as I stand at this shore, at once terrified
and moved, I still feel some kind of way about this invitation. Curious.
And cautious.

“African-American dollars should be reinvested in Africa” reverberates
through the Year of Return narrative. It makes sense that so many of us
would much rather support black-owned businesses with our hard-earned
money. But more than this, as I examine my unwillingness to tolerate
America’s insidious racism, its violence against black and brown bodies,
and the daily micro aggressions so many people of color have long
experienced, I find myself drawn to Ghana’s offer.

Ghana’s Year of Return website celebrates “the cumulative resilience of
all the victims of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.” It promised
everything from a welcoming World Music Festival to a Natural Hair Expo
to a First Bath Of Return and Naming Ceremony in which participants, as
is custom for African babies, are bathed, given African names and
presented to their extended African family.

While these events sounded interesting and somewhat moving, it was not
the way I wanted to see Ghana for the first time. I wanted the
circumstance rather than the pomp. I wanted truth.

**I HAD NEVER BEEN TO AFRICA.** But stepping out of that airport the
first morning, it felt as though I had always known Ghana. The deep heat
of the early morning so much like the South Carolina of my childhood.
The dark bodies that seemed to fill every space easily absorbed my own
dark body. And the smell — of petrol and cooking oil, of nuts roasting
and plantains frying, of sweat and sewage — quickly swept me up out of
jet-lag into the *right now* of Ghana’s capital, Accra.

We had planned to begin our journey here with a visit to the slave
castles and forts on the coast. But like a curtain all of us were a bit
afraid to open, we knew the trip would reveal more of what we already
knew — that Africans, including children, were sometimes kept for months
in dungeons, until enough were gathered to pack the hold of a slave
ship. That some of the captured Africans died in confinement while
others died during the Middle Passage, the longest leg of the triangular
journey between Europe, Africa and the Americas.

As we ate a breakfast of eggs and plantains in the cramped kitchen of an
apartment we’d rented in Accra’s Tesano district, we tried to ready
ourselves. Thick metal bars blocked the light coming in from the lush
garden behind the house in the upper middle class area, and the shower,
often cold, sometimes didn’t come on at all. Again and again, the small
daily inconveniences<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>reminded
us that we were no longer in America.

Behind our home, in what’s known as the boys’ quarters, a “houseboy”
named Ali, who didn’t look more than 15, squatted over a cookpot, making
rice over a coal fire. Ali lived alone in a darkened cement structure
with a single window. The “housegirl,” a woman who looked to be in her
60s, lived in an adjacent structure. Neither have electricity or running
water.

Ali was quiet and shy. When we left, we had to call him to unlock the
padlock to let us out of the gated building. In the night, when we
returned, we had to call him to let us back in. No matter the hour.
Bringing “houseboys” and “girls,” often distant relatives, to work in
the homes of better-off families is not unusual among the upper classes.
They are often paid very little and sometimes offered technical training
in lieu of an education. Our host’s home was separated from ours by a
lovely screened-in porch adorned with cushioned wicker furniture,
decorative bird cages and palm fronds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As I watched Ali crouched over his pot of rice, shyly smiling up at me
then quickly lowering his eyes, it was hard not to wonder about a
continuum here — a people among whom had lived Africans willing to help
sell their own into slavery; a people among whom lived those willing to
employ “a houseboy” and a “housegirl” in her 60s, who lived in darkened
rooms, while a family lived comfortably a few feet away.

And while I am completely sober in my knowledge that it was the evil of
white folks that kept my ancestors in bondage for centuries, I found
myself struggling to come to terms with those who worked with white
traders to move black bodies into chattel slavery.

“[The sad
truth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?searchResultPosition=7)
is that without complex business partnerships between African elites and
European traders and commercial agents, the slave trade to the New World
would have been impossible, at least on the scale it occurred,” the
Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote in 2010 in The New York
Times.

We decided we needed a few days before facing the brutality of
enslavement and headed instead to [Shai Hills Resource
Reserve](https://shai-hills-resource-reserve.business.site/#gallery), a
wildlife and hiking
retreat.

More than an hour north of Accra, the vast reserve has 31 types of
mammals, 13 different reptiles and 175 species of birds. But we’d come
for the baboons, which we’d been told were engaging and friendly. For
the next few hours, as my son sat in commune with baboon babies, adults
and elders, we took in the sites of the hilly retreat.

Its many caves still showed signs of the Shai people of the Ga-Adangbe
ethnic group, some of Ghana’s earliest inhabitants. Thrones carved from
rock were nearly hidden high up inside the caves. As we hiked the steep
hills, jumped across gaps that plummeted into black valleys, reached the
top to gape at the undulating land below us, I had no deep feeling of
belonging to this place. Not here. Not yet.

**AS A BLACK CHILD** of the 70s, the Africa I learned about in school,
books and via television, felt irrelevant to me. Like many of my
friends, I would turn on the Saturday morning cartoons to find some
unfortunate character trussed inside caldrons of boiling water as
drooling cannibals — supposedly African, supposedly savages — circled
them. The Africa I saw, from National Geographic pictures of
bare-chested African women to TV ads featuring starving children, was as
unfamiliar as the Middle Passage itself.

I was born in Ohio and raised in South Carolina and Brooklyn. For a long
time, all that mattered about who I was began and ended in America —
home to my grandparents, great-grandparents and greats beyond that. But
I am older now. And a mother who, thanks to DNA testing, understood how
deeply my roots connect to West Africa.

Yet, like the push and pull of the water here, I remained both drawn to
and dubious of Ghana’s beckoning.

A few weeks before our trip, I called Professor Gates and asked what he
thought of Ghana’s Year of Return. He said he believed it to be a
positive gesture. “Any program increasing the knowledge of Americans in
general and African-Americans in particular about African history and
the history of the slave trade is a good thing.”

Days after that call, I logged onto the Ghanaian website for information
on visas and was startled by [red
letters](https://www.ghanaconsulatenewyork.org/gcn/FamilyClientStart.aspx)
across the top of the page:

“Families are restricted to a nuclear family which is a family group
consisting of a father, mother and their children.”

Eye roll. We are not that. At the Ghana Consulate the following Monday,
I waited with my family’s stack of visa applications, ready to challenge
this notion of “family.” But moments later, when the woman behind the
counter asked where our children’s father was and I replied, “They have
two mothers,” without a pause, she responded, “Two mothers, huh? O.K.,”
and cleared our applications. And there it was — the push, the pull.
Where only minutes before I was ready to fight, now I wanted to hug
her.

A week into our trip, we were finally ready to see “the door of no
return” at Ghana’s oldest European structure, Elmina Castle. The drive
from Ghana’s capital to the town of Elmina took about three hours.

The massive stone castle, built in 1482 by the Portuguese and captured
by the Dutch in 1637, is among dozens of colonial slave forts that
remain along the Ghanaian coast. While many forts have been turned into
prisons, government offices, guesthouses, or simply left abandoned,
Elmina Castle and another infamous fortress, Cape Coast Castle, see
thousands of tourists
annually.

As we stood in an airless dungeon with its stone walls, dirt floor,
barred windows and doorways, we listened somberly while our guide broke
down our ancestors’ harrowing journey — the hundreds of captured people
packed into these small, still fetid spaces. The shackled women brought
out into the courtyards so the Dutch governor from his balcony could
choose the woman he wanted to rape that day. The chosen woman getting
washed and brought to him. We heard the stories of resisters being
shackled in the courtyard for days beneath a brutal sun, sent to
solitary confinement or killed. Above them in the opulent quarters of
the castle, which housed a sanctuary for white missionaries and a
church, Dutch officers enjoyed lavish meals and ocean views.

**WE TRIED NOT TO IMAGINE** what it was like. But, painful as it was, we
imagined it
anyway.

Then, from the darkness of the haunting space, our guide stepped out
into the bright cool air. With us still inside, he gently closed the
gate. “This is the last place enslaved Africans ever saw in Ghana,” he
said. With the click of the latch, small sobs escaped from the strangers
around me. “This is the point of no return,” he said.

But we had returned. Different. Still alive.

Now, as the kids take selfies along the shore by the castle, the current
has me again calling them away from the water. *But the light, Mommy,*
my daughter calls back, reminding me, that at 17, in the age of
Instagram, even this far from our home in Brooklyn, it is still a
moment’s light that matters most.

Hours have passed since our tour of the castle and as my partner and I
nervously watch the children near the roiling waves, we stand under the
canopy of a restaurant at the luxury beach resort, [Coconut
Grove](https://coconutgrovehotelsghana.com/). Behind us, the outdoor
dining room is nearly at capacity with huge groups of African-Americans,
mostly women, who arrived earlier in charter buses. Ranging from their
early 20s to well into their 80s, with elaborately styled hair,
beautifully manicured nails and T-shirts representing their sororities
or affiliations with historically black colleges, all of them are
somewhere on the lovely spectrum.

Others in these groups lounge around the pool in brightly printed
batakari shirts and flowing pata pata dresses. Just one week ago, the
words to describe these African garments were as foreign as the land I
stood on. But that easily, that quickly, all of it has become a part of
my own language. As though I’ve always spoken it. I am too shy to
approach these beautiful people — who have traveled here in groups and
seem to know each other as they move from table to table chatting,
giving hugs, drinking and laughing.

Almost two weeks into my time in Ghana, my heart remains in my throat.
There is nowhere in this country where the eye can land and the body not
feel, at once, both a deep pain and an immense
joy.

As I watch my children, I think of our days in Accra, where smiling
children ran past straggling goats toward slow-moving cars on bustling
streets, their closed hands tapping their mouths then opening out toward
passengers. And where, on a nearly deserted corner in the city, a lone
woman fried marinated sweet plantains over an open fire then sprinkled
them with fresh peanuts and with a gaptoothed smile, handed the kelewele
over to me. “You are my sister, I see it in your eyes,” she said,
dropping the few Ghanaian cedis I’ve paid into her apron pocket. As I
lifted the salty-sweet snack to my mouth, I wondered if it was only
black folks who felt as I do — as though everything around me is at
once, heartbreakingly familiar and foreign.

Now, far from Accra, as my children climb onto rocks separating the
restaurant at Coconut Grove from the ocean, their arms stretched out for
balance, their faces a deep brown from the many days of sun, I think
about what I’ve asked myself since landing on African soil. Can I belong
here? Has this country truly called me home?

**AS TRUE AS AN UNDERTOW**, I feel the water pulling me back across it,
taking me to where it took my ancestors centuries ago. To a land as
foreign to them as the African chiefs who offered brown bodies over for
[weapons](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/31/epiloguetothedebateonslav),
[brass and
cotton](http://www.discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/routes/bristol-to-africa/trade-goods/slave-trade-goods/).
As foreign as the white captors who raped, brutalized and enslaved those
same bodies. I feel the pull of the history that brought me here. And
the history that took me away. A feeling as old as my body itself
overcomes me — that I have never felt whole in one place. In Africa,
like America, I am only halfway home. My body belonging to both and
neither place.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Returning to Accra two days later, I dragged my reluctant children, now
wearied by the many teachable moments of this journey, to Nima, one of
the city’s most impoverished districts. Its lively outdoor Nima Market
has everything from used refrigerators and fresh fish floating in
buckets to antique Kente cloth. Nima is also home to a long-running
program for young people, Spread Out Initiative.

Located in a cramped structure only steps from a four-foot drop into a
trash-and-sewage-filled gutter, young Muslim children, mostly hijabed
girls, gathered on this Saturday to recite their spoken word, read from
their developing novels and engage in conversations around literature.
As my family sat in circled community with the young people, I was
struck by the vitality and joy on their faces, the assuredness and pride
with which they shared their words. All of it was a far cry from the
famished African children on the TV screens of my childhood. All of it,
in my mind, was the best kind of celebration.

Later that day, we went to the Art Center, an outdoor market in Accra.
In tented stalls, African craftspeople aggressively hawked their wares,
everything from African drums and T-shirts to lizardhead shoes and
purses. I sent my kids off on their own to wander the market and watched
as a dozen merchants trailed them, their bounty held out, their lilted
“*I’ll give you a nice price”* echoing. As the merchants came at them
from all sides, my partner and I laughed as our bewildered kids picked
up their pace, unsure how to deflect the kindness in the merchants’
voices, their sweet smiles, their
tenacity.

And then, for the first time, it hit me. As the circle of brown men
followed my children, I realized how physically safe I felt here in
Accra. Like the Deep South of my childhood, where the many brown bodies
of family protected me from an evil I knew was out there, here too,
African men, women and children around me felt old and safe, comforting
and good. And as with family, Ghana felt like complicated love.

That evening, we checked into Accra’s five-star [Kempinski
Hotel](https://www.kempinski.com/en/accra/hotel-gold-coast-city/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&source=S46992213&&utm_campaign=KIACC1%20-%20Kempinksi+Gold+Coast+City+Accra+-+Brand&utm_content=kempinski+hotel+ghana&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6KrtBRDLARIsAKzvQIFwU_T4N4YMRqr--nPyS3qjB6IsipfvgDQo1QskMKvWl8cLF_aX4OIaAk3mEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
because it’s fancy, has a huge pool surrounded by grassy fields and
because, for our last few days here, we wanted the water to actually
come out of the spigot when we turned it on. In the lobby, I spotted an
elegantly dressed African-American woman. When she smiled, my shyness
dropped away and I asked if I could sit with her for a while.

University and returned for good after practicing law for 20 years.

“What was so phenomenal was learning how much African-American culture
reflects and is a part of the African culture,” she said.

As we talked, we realized we’re both products of the Great Migration —
her family settled in Chicago, mine in New York City. And we spent
childhoods listening to our mothers and grandmothers make offhand
remarks like “don’t let anyone sweep your feet or you’ll never marry.”

Ayesha recounts hearing these same words from African women when she
arrived in Ghana.

**THE NEXT MORNING,** as my family climbs out of our car in Jamestown,
one of Accra’s oldest districts, we are met by the stench of sewage,
rotting fish, the briny smell of ocean and a seemingly endless number of
brightly painted fishing boats.

Scrawny dogs scatter as we approach, as quickly as children run toward
us, taking our own children’s hands and pulling them to join in their
exploration of the dilapidated boats and sealife at the water’s edge.

Later, as we eat our lunch — bowls of “red red,” a Ghanaian dish of palm
oil and black-eyed peas — at the [JamesTown
Café](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ghana/accra/nightlife/jamestown-cafe/a/poi-dri/1556679/355309),
where artists, intellectuals and musicians gather in the evening, I
taste the history of my own family’s black-eyed peas over rice in each
spicy
bite.

After a long hang at the cafe, we head to the [Makola
Market](https://visitghana.com/shopping_location/makola-market/)in the
center of Accra. There, young girls called Kayayei from the Hausa ethnic
group in the northern parts of West Africa wait to be hired. “Kaya”
means, among other things, “load” in the Hausa language, and “Yei” in
the Ga language means “women.”

These girls move through the market carrying people’s large shopping
bundles in metal bowls propped on their heads with the hope of raising
money for their own dowries. My longtime friend, Catherine McKinley, an
African-American writer and curator who was in Ghana working on an art
installation, waved over a small girl. “Let’s be Auntie to this child,”
she said, laughing. “Get her dowry paid off in one job.”

We are two of the few foreigners at this market, but Catherine, having
spent many years in Ghana, navigates it easily. We hire the puzzled
child to follow behind us carrying nothing. Her back and neck straight,
she eyes us suspiciously. I see parts of my own young self in her
questioning, the 10-year-old side-eye waiting for the truth.

Minutes later, when we pay her what we hope is the equivalent of two
dowries, we see, for the first time, the way her face expands into a
disbelieving smile, her dark eyes now shining. As crowds move around us,
bartering for nuts, fabrics, plastic rugs, toothbrushes, wigs and even
here, for the toil of bodies, I watch the girl disappear into the chaos,
her silver bowl becoming one of many silver bowls. Her brown body, one
of many brown
bodies.

The streets grow quieter as the day ends, and we walk them one more time
before we leave the next morning. On our final night in Ghana, we are
walking to remember it. An old woman in a faded pata pata dress,
crouched and sweeping with a handle-less broom, uprights herself as we
pass. “Akwaaba\!” she said. “Welcome.” “Medaase,” I respond. “Thank
you.”

“Could you guys live here,” I asked our children, as they walked ahead
of us, as comfortable as if they were walking down our neighborhood
streets in Brooklyn.

“Yeah, I guess,” my son said. “If we had to.”

“I couldn’t,” I tell them. “Not for always. Some of the time maybe. We
can go and come back. Keep going and coming back.”

“I guess that’s what makes us African,” my son said. “And American.”
