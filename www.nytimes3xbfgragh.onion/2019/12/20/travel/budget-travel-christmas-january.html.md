It’s the season of lights, holiday markets and caroling. And it’s also a
time of crowds and inflated hotel rates.

But many cities keep the seasonal lights on in January, when the throngs
and prices ease. Many also add events to entice travelers, including
food and arts celebrations.

The following cities make a thrifty financial case for celebrating the
holidays in January.

## Chicago

Most of the seasonal displays in Chicago are up through Jan. 5,
including the
[ZooLights](https://www.lpzoo.org/zoolights-presented-comed-and-invesco-qqq)
at the Lincoln Park Zoo (free admission);
[Lightscape](https://www.chicagobotanic.org/lightscape), a mile-long
illuminated path with a tunnel and singing trees, at the Chicago Botanic
Garden (from $17); “Christmas Around the World” at the [Museum of
Science and
Industry](https://www.msichicago.org/explore/whats-here/exhibits/christmas-around-the-world/),
featuring more than 50 lighted trees (from $19.95); and heli-holiday
light tours with [Chicago Helicopter
Experience](https://www.chicagohelicopterexperience.com/product/holiday-lights-experience/)
($159.99 a passenger).

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The family-friendly Fifth Third Bank [Winter
Wonderfest](https://navypier.org/event/fifth-third-bank-winter-wonderfest-2019/)
at Navy Pier continues through Jan. 12 with an indoor holiday
playground, inflatable slides, aerialist shows and carnival rides (from
$20).

A Chicago resident, I start every New Year’s Day at the [Skating
Ribbon](https://maggiedaleypark.com/things-to-do-see/skating-ribbon/) at
Maggie Daley Park, an outdoor ice path (free; skate rentals from $13).
There’s also free skating at nearby [Millennium
Park](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/millennium_park10.html)
(through March 8).

It may be freezing, but as far as crowds go, January is an uncongested
month to visit Chicago, with added attractions that include the [Chicago
Sketch Comedy Festival](https://www.stage773.com/cscf-lineup-2020)
(tickets from $15; Jan. 9 to 19) and [Chicago Restaurant
Week](https://www.choosechicago.com/chicago-restaurant-week/) (Jan. 24
to Feb. 9).

As the temperatures drop, so do hotel rates. The first weekend in
January, Expedia recently had rates at the [Ace Hotel
Chicago](https://www.acehotel.com/chicago/) at $131, about $100 less
than in
mid-December.

## Kansas City

For 90 years, the [Plaza
Lights](https://www.visitkc.com/visitors/things-do/kansas-city-plaza-lights)
have brightened 15 blocks of buildings on [Country Club
Plaza](https://countryclubplaza.com/), a Spanish-inspired shopping
district built in 1922. Strings of lights outline rooflines, corners and
windows though Jan. 12.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Kansas City is a Sister City with Seville, Spain, and much of the
architecture of the plaza looks like Seville,” said Diana Lambdin Meyer,
a Kansas City-based freelance writer who has written travel guides to
Kansas. “It has beautiful Moorish architecture you don’t expect to see
in the Midwest and if you go late at night, when there are no cars and a
little snow on the ground, it’s magical.”

At downtown’s Crown Center, the Mayor’s Christmas Tree — this year a
100-foot-tall conifer decorated in 10,600 white bulbs — will remain in
place through Jan. 5. But ice skating at the adjacent [Crown Center Ice
Terrace](https://www.crowncenter.com/business/crown-center-ice-terrace)
will continue through March 8 (admission $7; rentals $4).

In recent searches, the [Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown
Center](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/mcicr-sheraton-kansas-city-hotel-at-crown-center/)
didn’t show much fluctuation in rates between December and January,
starting at around $134 on Orbitz. But a stay at the art-filled [21c
Museum Hotel Kansas City](https://www.21cmuseumhotels.com/) dropped by
about $100 a night in January to around $225.

Post-holiday, visitors can also take advantage of [Kansas City
Restaurant Week](http://www.kcrestaurantweek.com/), which runs Jan. 10
to 19, featuring menus at $15 and $35 at more than 200
restaurants.

77-foot-tall Norway spruce tree, strung with five miles of wire and
50,000 lights, illuminated until mid-January.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are more displays in other boroughs, including Queens, where the
[Hello Panda Festival](http://www.hellopandafest.com/) at Citi Field
features seasonal light displays, contemporary art exhibitions and
interactive games through Jan. 26 (adult admission from $25). Staten
Island’s [Winter Lantern
Festival](https://www.nycwinterlanternfestival.com/) runs to Jan. 12
(from $23). In the Bronx, the [New York Botanical
Garden](https://www.nybg.org/event/holiday-train-show/) runs its Holiday
Train Show through Jan. 26 (from $23) and the [Bronx
Zoo](https://bronxzoo.com/holiday-lights) turns on its holiday lights
Jan. 3 to 5 (from $22.95).

Hotel savings are significant: In early January, rates at the [W New
York - Times
Square](https://www.whotelsnewyork.com/property/w-new-york-times-square/)
could be found on Google for $156 a night, hundreds of dollars cheaper
than on a mid-December weekend.

“Travel in January is just so much more astoundingly affordable in New
York,” said Pauline Frommer, the editorial director of Frommer’s and
author of “Frommer’s EasyGuide to New York City 2020.” For continued
festivities, she highlighted the [No Pants Subway
Ride](https://improveverywhere.com/2019/12/02/save-the-date-no-pants-subway-ride-2020/)
(Jan. 12), [Winter Jazzfest](https://www.winterjazzfest.com/) (Jan. 9 to
18) and [NYC Restaurant Week](https://www.nycgo.com/restaurant-week/),
which offers discounts (Jan. 21 to Feb. 9).

Winter, she added, “is risky weather-wise, but so much of the action in
New York is inside that it really doesn’t matter as much.”

## San Antonio

During the holidays in San Antonio, more than 2,200 strings of lights
drape the bald cypress trees that line the riverside public walkway
known as [the
Riverwalk](https://www.thesanantonioriverwalk.com/events/holiday-lights-on-the-river-walk1)
and stay in place through Jan. 13. Nearby, a new [outdoor ice
rink](http://rotaryicerink.com/) joins the 50-foot Christmas tree in
downtown Travis Park, open for skating through Jan. 31 (admission $10;
skate rentals $4). About three miles north, [Light the
Way](https://lightthewaysa.com/about/), an installation illuminating the
[University of the Incarnate Word](https://lightthewaysa.com/about/),
runs through Jan. 6.

Reflecting its Latin American culture, San Antonio widely celebrates
Three Kings Day, the day the three wise men presented Jesus with gifts,
according to the Bible. The [Puerto Rican Heritage Society Fiesta de los
Tres Reyes](http://www.sociedadherenciaprsa.org/) takes place Jan. 5 and
includes music and a telling of the story at downtown’s San Fernando
Cathedral (free). In addition to its display of nine million lights,
[SeaWorld San
Antonio](http://sanantonio.culturemap.com/eventdetail/seaworld-san-antonio-presents-three-kings-day-cele/)
will stage appearances by the kings from Jan. 1 to 5 (admission from
$54.99).

David Gonzalez, the spokesman for Visit San Antonio, said hotel rates
ran 5 percent lower last January versus December 2018. This year,
several hotels are offering holiday packages, including the [Hilton San
Antonio Hill
Country](https://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/texas/hilton-san-antonio-hill-country-SATHCHF/index.html)
where rates start at $89 and include complimentary s’mores kits, outdoor
movies and shuttles to SeaWorld through Jan.
13.

## London

Many of the lights of London switch off after Jan. 5, including the LED
curtain lights on [Oxford Street](https://www.oxfordstreet.co.uk/) and
[Hyde Park Winter Wonderland](https://hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/)’s
ice rink, roller coasters and an ice bar (free admission). But some
remain on longer, including “[Chromotherapy
Christmas](http://mayfairandbelgravia.com/eccleston-yards/news-and-events/chromotherapy-christmas)”
at Eccleston Yards, featuring 500 suspended orbs in colors said to
energize, calm or evoke happiness (free; through Jan. 11).

Others switch on in January, such as the [Winter Lights installation at
Canary
Wharf](https://canarywharf.com/arts-events/events/winter-lights-jan-2020/?instance_id=),
promising more than 25 installations that include grids of dangling
light strings, illuminated fountains and projected images (free; Jan. 16
to 25).
[Lightopia](http://chiswickhouseandgardens.org.uk/event/lightopia/)
comes to Chiswick House and Gardens Jan. 22 to March 1 (from 20 pounds,
or about $26.25).

In addition to being free, many London museums, including the Tate
Britain and Tate Modern, are less crowded.

“While January is one of the colder months in the capital, I’d argue
that this provides the perfect opportunity to buy a new sweater in the
famous January sales,” Laura Citron, the chief executive of London &
Partners, the city’s tourism agency, wrote in an email. Most sales,
often the only sale of the year, run through the month.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s also sale season at hotels. Google recently showed rates from $184
at the [DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London – Tower of
London](https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/united-kingdom/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-london-tower-of-london-LONTLDI/index.html)
on a mid-December weekend versus $119 in early January.
