Almost immediately after ending his White House employment, [Stephen K.
Bannon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/nyregion/steve-bannon-build-the-wall-fraud.html),
the former chief strategist to President Trump, forged a lucrative
financial relationship with a mysterious Chinese billionaire who was
sought by Beijing for extradition from the United States.

China’s government had already accused [Guo Wengui, a real estate
magnate also known as Miles Kwok, of money laundering, bribery and
rape](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/10/magazine/the-mystery-of-the-exiled-billionaire-whistleblower.html)
when he and Mr. Bannon developed a mutually beneficial relationship that
began with a $150,000 loan to Mr. Trump’s onetime confidant, according
to a memo written in May 2019 and obtained by The New York Times.

It escalated to a yearlong million-dollar contract, for which Mr. Bannon
promised to introduce executives of Guo Media to “media personalities,”
[according to the news outlet
Axios](https://www.axios.com/steve-bannon-contract-chinese-billionaire-guo-media-fa6bc244-6d7a-4a53-9f03-1296d4fae5aa.html).

Mr. Guo has denied accusations of lawbreaking and says Beijing’s
extradition request is retaliation for his outspoken criticism of
Chinese corruption. He has forged relationships with China hard-liners
like Mr. Bannon in the United States, [has a membership to Mr. Trump’s
Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach,
Fla.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-tycoon-holed-up-in-manhattan-hotel-is-accused-of-spying-for-beijing-11563810726),
and is [seeking asylum while in the United States staying at his
palatial apartment overlooking Central
Park](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/07/world/asia/china-guo-wengui-corruption-asylum.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Bannon, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on his
relationship with Mr. Guo. A spokesman for Mr. Guo and a person close to
Mr. Bannon said the initial loan to Mr. Bannon related to a film project
critical of the Chinese Communist Party. According to the memo, it was
repaid last year by being taken out of a portion of Mr. Bannon’s
contract with Guo Media.

Aides to both men have described their relationship as grounded in a
mutual disdain for the Chinese Communist Party.

The loan reveals a financial relationship that began when Mr. Guo’s
whereabouts was a focus of Chinese officials, who had put out notices
for his arrest through Interpol.

Mr. Bannon, who left the White House in August 2017, has been focused on
issues related to China for years, and Mr. Guo’s conflict with the
Chinese government was on his radar while he was working for Mr. Trump,
according to a person close to him.

Daniel Podhaskie, an attorney for Mr. Guo, said Mr. Bannon and Mr. Guo
[first met in
October 2017](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/04/business/stephen-bannon-guo-wengui-china.html),
after an appearance by Mr. Guo at the Hudson Institute, a conservative
research organization, was canceled.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said Mr. Guo then introduced Mr. Bannon to the media group associated
with Mr. Guo. Mr. Podhaskie told Axios that Mr. Guo was “merely the
face” of Guo Media.

Mr. Bannon is said to have finished his contract and is no longer being
paid by Guo Media.

But Mr. Bannon broadcast a radio show critical of the Chinese Communist
Party from Mr. Guo’s apartment in Manhattan. The show does not air in
the United States but has been broadcast into China, a person close to
Mr. Bannon said.

That is in keeping with other projects that Mr. Bannon has taken on
since his widely publicized falling out with Mr. Trump. Broadcasting
from Washington, Mr. Bannon leads a radio show defending Mr. Trump in
his impeachment battle called the “War Room.”

He has also helped raise money to privately build part of the wall that
Mr. Trump wants along the border with Mexico. And he has been working on
the Tibetan independence movement and in support of Muslim Uighurs who
face persecution in China.
