\section{Giants Agree to Hire Joe Judge as Head
Coach}\label{giants-agree-to-hire-joe-judge-as-head-coach}}

The Patriots assistant had not been considered a top target, but he
quickly emerged as the Giants' choice. Matt Rhule, presumed to be the
leading candidate, agreed to a deal with the Carolina Panthers.

The Giants, who joined the N.F.L. in 1925, have become known for a
staid, prudent management style. True to form, on Tuesday morning, the
team was expected to do something predictable: Hire Matt Rhule, the
former Giants assistant coach who has become a rising star after
rebuilding downtrodden college football programs at Temple and Baylor.

But early Tuesday, Rhule jolted the N.F.L. coaching carousel by agreeing
to coach the Carolina Panthers. Roughly an hour later, the normally
judicious Giants had some thunderbolt news of their own: The 19th coach
in the team's 95-year history would be Joe Judge, a special teams
coordinator and wide receivers coach for the New England Patriots who
has no head coaching experience at any level.

The Giants confirmed the hire on Wednesday. ``The mission is clear, to
win games,'' Judge said
in\href{https://www.giants.com/news/joe-judge-hired-new-head-coach-new-england-patriots-special-teams-coordinator}{a
statement}. ``There is a process to reaching that objective, and we will
implement that process and work that process starting today.''

Judge, 38, has been a part of three of the Patriots' Super Bowl
championship teams and was on Coach Nick Saban's staff during two of the
University of Alabama's recent national championship seasons. Before
Judge interviewed with the Giants on Monday, team officials had reached
out to Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, a former Giants assistant, who
gave Judge a glowing recommendation.

Though Judge's background with the Patriots is on special teams --- an
assignment Belichick once held with the Giants --- Belichick told the
Giants that Judge could coach any facet of football, adding that the two
had frequent conversations about offense and defense.

Still, Judge's hiring startled the pro football community, because the
Giants had scheduled an interview with Josh McDaniels, Belichick's more
prominent and sought-after offensive coordinator, who was the head coach
of the Denver Broncos in 2009 and '10. The Giants had interviewed
McDaniels after the 2017 season before hiring
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/30/sports/football/NFL-coaches-fired.html}{Pat
Shurmur, who was dismissed last week} after a 4-12 season. Two years
ago, McDaniels agreed to coach the Indianapolis Colts but
\href{http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000915131/article/josh-mcdaniels-withdraws-from-colts-coaching-job}{pulled
out of the job}to remain with the Patriots.

Last week, the Giants interviewed the Kansas City Chiefs' offensive
coordinator, Eric Bieniemy; the Baltimore Ravens' defensive coordinator,
Don Martindale; the former Green Bay Packers Coach Mike McCarthy; and
the Dallas Cowboys assistant Kris Richard.

McCarthy, who won a Super Bowl with the Packers, seemed a good fit for
the Giants, but he was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/06/sports/football/mike-mccarthy-jerry-jones-cowboys.html}{lured
away over the weekend by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.} On Tuesday
when Rhule accepted a gargantuan deal from Carolina
reportedly\href{https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1214583051478601728}{worth
\$60 million over seven years}, it appeared that the Giants had been
outfoxed in a race for the two most recognizable candidates.

There was also the possibility that the Giants' current and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/30/sports/football/pat-shurmur-dave-gettleman-giants.html}{longstanding
management structure} --- in which the coach reports to a general
manager, in this case Dave Gettleman --- had become an impediment to
attracting a new coach. Increasingly, teams have begun allowing head
coaches to handle many personnel matters once reserved for general
managers.

Jed Hughes, a leading coaching and executive search consultant for the
sports industry, said on Tuesday that the momentum of the N.F.L. was
carrying it toward a model in which the head coach runs the football
operations.

``Having the head coach in control is important,'' Hughes said. ``The
coach has the ability to create the culture.''

It is not clear whether Judge, especially given his lack of head
coaching experience, will be granted any added off-field duties with the
Giants. In a news conference last week, the team's co-owner John Mara,
speaking alongside his ownership partner, Steve Tisch, conceded that he
would consider altering the power dynamic within the organization.

``I'm always willing to look at whatever's going to improve the team,''
Mara said when asked about making such changes, ``and if I felt that
there was somebody coming in here as a head coach who wanted a different
role and he could convince Steve and I that that would make sense for
our organization, we would certainly consider that.''

Whatever Judge's specific role will be, the Giants acted swiftly after
the news that Rhule would be going to Carolina, agreeing to hire Judge
by midday, although
\href{https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1214580737409781761}{ESPN
reported} that the Giants and Judge began negotiating contract terms on
Monday night.

The Giants had no comment on Judge's hiring Tuesday, but it's possible
they saw an inspiring example in one of this season's strongest teams. A
leading candidate for the Coach of the Year Award in the N.F.L. this
season is Baltimore's John Harbaugh, a former special teams coach.
Harbaugh won the Super Bowl seven years ago with the Ravens, who have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/10/sports/football/lamar-jackson-ravens.html}{boldly
built their current offense around the second-year quarterback Lamar
Jackson}. They are the top-seeded team in the A.F.C., and Jackson is the
prohibitive favorite to win the league's Most Valuable Player Award.

But Giants fans could be forgiven if Judge's hiring resurrects some
uncomfortable recent memories. When Ben McAdoo was named the successor
to Giants Coach Tom Coughlin before the 2016 season, he had been a
longtime assistant and coordinator, but it was widely noted that he had
never been a head coach at any level of football. He lasted less than
two full seasons, departing with a 13-15 record.

A native of Philadelphia, Judge attended Mississippi State, where he
played a variety of positions. After graduating in 2005, he became a
graduate assistant with his alma mater, before moving to
Birmingham-Southern as a linebackers coach. He then became an analyst at
Alabama for three seasons under Saban, who is a close friend of
Belichick's. Judge joined the Patriots in 2012.
