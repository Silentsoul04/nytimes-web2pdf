# Trump’s Inaccurate Statements About the Conflict With Iran

In his address from the White House, the president was misleading in

President Trump, [responding during a White House
address](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/08/world/middleeast/trump-speech.html)
on Wednesday to the [missile strikes by
Iran](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/07/world/middleeast/iran-fires-missiles-us.html),
assailed the nuclear agreement reached by his predecessor and praised
American military might. The [10-minute
address](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/08/us/politics/trump-address.html)
contained numerous inaccuracies and claims that lacked evidence. Here’s
a fact check.

What Mr. Trump Said

*“Iran’s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran
nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not
to mention $1.8 billion in cash.”*

**This is misleading.** The agreement reached by Iran, the United States
and a number of other nations to constrain Tehran’s nuclear program did
not directly provide American money to Iran, but it did [release about
$100
billion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/17/world/middleeast/iran-sanctions-lifted-nuclear-deal.html)
in previously frozen Iranian assets. Much of the amount was tied up by
debt obligations, for example, [$20 billion to
China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hearing-on-iran-nuclear-deal-opens-with-sharp-gop-criticism/2015/07/23/2003439e-309d-11e5-8f36-18d1d501920d_story.html?utm_term=.a19fd79013dc)
for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount
available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.

A separate [$1.7 billion transfer of cash to
Iran](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/19/world/middleeast/iran-us-cash-payment-prisoners.html)
was to settle a decades-long dispute and was agreed to in negotiations
that happened parallel to the nuclear deal. Before the 1979 revolution,
Iran’s shah had paid $400 million for American military goods but, after
he was overthrown, the equipment was never delivered. The clerics who
seized control demanded the money back, but the United States refused.
The additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35 years.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Iran and other parties to the nuclear accord signed an [interim
agreement
in 2013](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/11/24/world/middleeast/talks-with-iran-on-nuclear-deal-hang-in-balance.html),
but the formal agreement [was not reached
until 2015](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html).
The White House did not respond when asked for evidence of increased
Iranian “hostilities.”

It is worth noting that before Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from
the nuclear agreement in 2018, his administration [repeatedly
certified](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-recertify.html)
that Iran was in compliance.

Afterward, as his so-called maximum-pressure campaign on Iran continued,
tensions between the United States and Iran “escalated significantly,”
[according to a recent Congressional Research Service
report](https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20200106_R45795_9689491d73fa893072e210735ae913435277c51e.pdf).
Mr. Trump’s claim blaming the nuclear accord for Iranian aggression
rather than his withdrawal from it is “almost an inverted reality,” said
Jim Walsh, a research associate at M.I.T.’s Security Studies Program and
an expert on nuclear issues and the Middle East.

He said that attacks by the four groups supported by Iran and designated
by some governments as terrorist organizations — Hezbollah, Hamas,
Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command — actually declined after the nuclear deal.

Attacks carried out by these groups decreased from more than 80 in 2014
to six in 2017, before increasing to more than 40 in 2018, according to
the [Global Terrorism
Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?start_yearonly=&end_yearonly=&start_year=&start_month=&start_day=&end_year=&end_month=&end_day=&asmSelect0=&perpetrator=399&perpetrator=407&perpetrator=1930&perpetrator=2108&perpetrator=838&perpetrator=4413&dtp2=all&success=yes&casualties_type=b&casualties_max=)
maintained by the University of Maryland’s National Consortium for the
Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. And while Iran has been a
violent and destabilizing force across the region, Mr. Trump’s assertion
that Tehran had “created hell” lacked context in some cases.

Iranian aid to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in that country’s
civil war and Tehran’s backing of Houthi rebels in Yemen

the signing of the nuclear agreement, formally known as the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action.

“There’s nothing that Iran was doing after J.C.P.O.A. that it wasn’t
doing before,” said Vali R. Nasr, a professor of Middle East studies at
Johns Hopkins University and a State Department official in the Obama
administration.

Calling Iran’s backing of the Houthi rebels against the Saudi
Arabia-aligned government in Yemen terrorism is “devaluing the word to
the point where it’s meaningless,” said Anthony Cordesman, an expert on
military affairs and the Middle East at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.

As for Iran’s activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Cordesman said,
“they were more aggressive there because they were working to attack
ISIS — as we were.”

What Mr. Trump said

*“The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with
the funds made available by the last administration.”*

**This lacks evidence.** The White House did not respond when asked to
substantiate this claim, and experts noted there was no proof that
Iranian assets unfrozen by the deal paid for the missiles.

“There’s a certain fungibility here,” Mr. Walsh said. If the Iranian
foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, “took a dollar on the street,
did that fund the missile attack?” he added. “That’s not very useful
from an analytical perspective. Nor is the case that giving them money
caused them to attack the U.S.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We have no indication,” Mr. Cordesman said, “whether these missiles are
funded by the money from the J.C.P.O.A.”

The director of national intelligence’s annual report on worldwide
threats
[in 2019](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf#page=30)
did note that Iran continued to develop and improve military
capabilities including ballistic missiles, but it did not tie those
efforts to the nuclear deal. Furthermore, the annual reports warned of
the same efforts in
[2015](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Unclassified_2015_ATA_SFR_-_SASC_FINAL.pdf#page=18),
[2014](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Intelligence%20Reports/2014%20WWTA%20%20SFR_SSCI_29_Jan.pdf#page=9),
[2013](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Intelligence%20Reports/UNCLASS_2013%20ATA%20SFR%20FINAL%20for%20SASC%2018%20Apr%202013.pdf#page=13),
[2012](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/20120131_testimony_ata.pdf#page=7)
and
[before](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/20110310_testimony_clapper.pdf#page=5).

Critics of the Iran deal, including Mr. Trump, have long argued that it
was inadequate because it did not address Iran’s ability to develop
ballistic missiles. Those restrictions [have instead been
established](https://www.armscontrol.org/2015-08/appendix-e-iran%E2%80%99s-ballistic-missiles-nuclear-deal)
by the United Nations Security Council resolutions.

The diplomatic accord was an arms deal with a very narrow aim of curbing
Iran’s nuclear ambitions, “not a nonaggression pact, not a form of a
friendship treaty,” Mr. Nasr of Johns Hopkins said. “Whether there could
have been more in the deal, of course. But piling in expectations is
disingenuous.”

What Mr. Trump Said

*“The very defective J.C.P.O.A. expires shortly anyway and gives Iran a
clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.”*

**This is exaggerated.** The major provisions limiting Iran’s nuclear
capabilities last a decade or longer. And the agreement increased the
“breakout” period — the time it would take Iran to produce enough fuel
for one weapon — to at least a year from [an estimated two to three
months](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R43333.pdf). If the deal had been
left in place and fully adhered to, Iran would not have been able to
achieve nuclear breakout until 2030.

The agreement also prohibits Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons
permanently. “Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever
seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons,” the first paragraph of
the deal reads.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a vocal critic of the
deal, said it “[largely expires after only 15
years](https://www.aipac.org/-/media/publications/policy-and-politics/fact-sheets/other/the-iran-nuclear-deal-expiration-dates-and-consequences.pdf).”

Under the deal’s terms, Iran agreed not to use more than 5,060
centrifuges to enrich uranium — and to abide by limits on the types of
centrifuges allowed in its research and development program — for 10
years. Limits on enrichment levels, facilities and stockpiles last for
15 years, according to [a
report](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R43333.pdf) from the Congressional
Research Service.

Under the terms of the accord, Iran also agreed to convert a deep
underground enrichment facility into a “technology center” that cannot
contain nuclear material and where the number of centrifuges is limited
for 15 years. Several provisions on plutonium, including forbidding the
construction of new heavy water reactors, [last for 15
years](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/IranDealDefinitiveGuide.pdf#page=13).

Inspectors are to monitor centrifuges and related infrastructure for 15
years, verify inventory for 20 years and monitor uranium mines for 25
years.

What Mr. Trump Said

*“We are now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the
world. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil.”*

**This is misleading.** The United States has been the largest producer
of oil and gas in the world
[since 2013](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=13251), a
trend that began under the Obama administration thanks in large part to
advances in shale drilling techniques.

The Energy Information Administration [projected in
January 2019](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38152)
that the United States will produce more energy than it imports this
year, the first time since 1950. But that is not the same thing as not
importing oil from the Middle East at all. In 2018, [the United States
imported](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/mer.pdf#page=71)
more than 1.5 million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What Was Said

*“The American military has been completely rebuilt under my
administration at a cost of $2.5 trillion.”*

**This is exaggerated.** The $2.5 trillion figure refers to the [total
defense
budgets](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2020/FY20_Green_Book.pdf#page=29)
of the past four fiscal years: $606 billion the 2017 fiscal year (which
began before Mr. Trump took office), $671 billion in 2018, $685 billion
in 2019 and $718 billion in 2020. But the amount spent on procurement —
buying and upgrading equipment — was about $562 billion over that
period.

Mr. Trump’s use of the phrase “completely rebuilt” is somewhat
subjective. Though the Trump administration has invested in operational
readiness over the past few years, there are signs that the military
continues to face substantial challenges in addressing an array of
threats from around the world.

For example, the military earned a middling grade of
“[marginal](https://www.heritage.org/military-strength/assessment-us-military-power/conclusion-us-military-power)”
from the conservative Heritage Foundation’s annual index of strength,
based on factors like shortages in personnel and aging equipment. The
think tank noted that American forces are probably capable of meeting
the demands of a single major regional conflict but “would be very
hard-pressed to do more and certainly would be ill-equipped to handle
two nearly simultaneous major regional contingencies.”

What Was Said

*“Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its
territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi,
who was responsible for so much death.”*

**This is exaggerated.** The Islamic State lost its final territories
[in
March 2019](https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/q3fy2019_leadig_oir_report.pdf),
ending the physical “caliphate,” but the terrorist group has not been
destroyed. The recent confrontation with Iran has [halted the United
States’
campaign](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/05/us/politics/us-isis-iran.html)
against ISIS.

Just this week, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley,
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, [said that the
fight](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2051321/press-gaggle-with-secretary-of-defense-dr-mark-t-esper-and-chairman-of-the-join/)
against the group was continuing.

Mr. Trump alluded to the organization’s endurance in his speech when he
said: “ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction of ISIS is good
for Iran. And we should work together on this and other shared
priorities.”
