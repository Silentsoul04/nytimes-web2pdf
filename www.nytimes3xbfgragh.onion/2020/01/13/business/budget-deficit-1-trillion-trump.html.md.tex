The budget gap widened despite a growing economy, hitting its highest
level since 2012.

WASHINGTON --- The federal budget deficit surpassed \$1 trillion in
2019, the Treasury Department reported on Monday, as tax cuts and
spending increases continued to force heavy government borrowing amid a
record-long economic expansion.

The deficit grew by 17 percent from 2018 to 2019, the
\href{https://fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/mts/current.html}{Treasury
data shows}. That was a slowdown from the 28 percent growth in 2018, the
first year President Trump's signature tax cuts were in full effect.
Last year's deficit would have been even larger if not for a series of
interest-rate cuts undertaken in 2019 by the Federal Reserve, which
helped to push the cost of new government debt down.

It was the first calendar year since 2012 that the deficit topped \$1
trillion. Deficits swelled after the 2008 financial crisis, as lawmakers
cut taxes and increased spending in an effort to revive growth. The gap
had narrowed through 2015 under a budget agreement between President
Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress, which reined in federal
spending.

The widening deficit under Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/08/business/economy/trump-stimulus-economy.html}{shows
the degree} to which economic growth on his watch has been helped by
fiscal stimulus --- increased borrowing by the government that injects
more money into the consumer economy. That combination is unusual for a
growing economy with low unemployment. In recent periods in the United
States, sustained economic expansions have brought deficits down.

A wave of retirements by baby boomers has begun to put pressure on the
deficit by helping to drive up annual spending on Social Security and
Medicare. But Mr. Trump has increased that pressure by signing both a
\$1.5 trillion tax-cut package in late 2017, which reduced federal tax
revenue, and a series of bipartisan congressional agreements to increase
spending on the military and on nondefense domestic programs like
education.

Total federal receipts rose by 5 percent in 2019, after falling slightly
in 2018 after the tax cuts. It was the fastest rate of growth for tax
receipts since 2015, but still well below several years of receipts
growth recorded under Mr. Obama.

Spending grew by 7.5 percent in 2019, the fastest rate since 2009.

Mr. Trump promised to balance the budget and constrain federal spending
as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, and at one point he
said he could pay off the entire
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/business/economy/national-debt-coronavirus-stimulus.html}{federal
debt} in eight years. He and other Republicans have long criticized
Democrats, particularly Mr. Obama, for spending too much and running up
the deficit.

In pushing for the tax cuts, Mr. Trump and his allies promised they
would generate enough growth to ``pay for themselves'' through economic
growth that generated additional tax revenues.

The Treasury Department data released on Monday shows how far Mr. Trump
has fallen short of each of those promises. Tax revenues remain hundreds
of billions of dollars below where the Congressional Budget Office
predicted they would be before the tax-cut package was signed, while
spending is accelerating at roughly the same pace as those 2017
projections.

In the three years Mr. Trump has been president, federal revenues have
increased by an average of 2.6 percent per year. Spending has increased
by 5.7 percent per year, and the deficit has grown by 20.8 percent per
year.

Under Mr. Obama, receipts grew significantly faster, at an average of
3.9 percent per year. Spending grew at less than half the average annual
rate than it has under Mr. Trump. The deficit has grown nearly four
times as fast, on average, under Mr. Trump than it did under Mr. Obama.
Mr. Trump has already added more to the national debt than Mr. Obama did
in his entire second term --- \$2.6 trillion, compared with Mr. Obama's
\$2.1 trillion.
