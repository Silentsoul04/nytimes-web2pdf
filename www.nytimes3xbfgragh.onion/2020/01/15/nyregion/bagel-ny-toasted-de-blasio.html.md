Picking a favorite bagel on National Bagel Day is bound to get any New
York City mayor into trouble with some portion of his 8 million
constituents, who are bound to have differing hard-held opinions.

But Bill de Blasio, following a failed presidential campaign, managed to
cause a particularly unusual uproar.

In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio [declared his love for a
bagel](https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1217530245672325123) that
fits his political persona: the Bagel Hole bakery in Park Slope,
Brooklyn, which serves a chewy and celebrated variety in the leafy
neighborhood where the mayor raised his family.

Then he crossed into treacherous territory for bagel aficionados: He
said his go-to bagel was whole wheat with extra cream cheese. Toasted.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New Yorkers first responded with indignation, asserting that a good
bagel should never be toasted.

Scorn immediately followed: Bagel Hole does not, in fact, toast its
sacred treats.

Mr. de Blasio quickly deleted the post, and added a corrected version
that removed all mention of the word toast.

He seemed to take the kerfuffle in stride, responding to one critic:
“What can I say, I must have a hole in my memory.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The toasted tumult, which was christened BagelGate on social media,
spawned salty bagel puns and started a conversation about finding the
best bagel in a city known for its culinary hegemony.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There were smears, or perhaps schmears, against his choice and some
defenders cried, “No one has lox on the subject.”

Elected officials saw an opportunity to step into the bagel leadership
vacuum. Keith Powers, a city councilman in Manhattan, offered a more
popular pick: “Everything bagel, not toasted, Ess-A-Bagel” — another
popular bakery in Manhattan.

Brad Hoylman, a state senator, posted a poll: “O.K., New York, it’s time
to answer the essential question of the day: Is toasting a bagel a
crime?” As of late afternoon, “Yes, toasting is a crime” was losing to
“No, I like ruining bagels.”

It was not the first dining gaffe for Mr. de Blasio, who was born in New
York but grew up outside Boston.

In 2014, he was famously caught eating pizza with a fork in Staten
Island. He was chastised for not eating the slice with his hands, but
defended his decision.

“In my ancestral homeland, it’s more typical to eat with a fork and
knife,” said Mr. de Blasio, whose mother was Italian.

Eating on the campaign trail is a rite of passage for candidates, but it
can backfire. An ally of the mayor, Cynthia Nixon, was criticized for
her bagel preference in 2018 when she ran for governor (unsuccessfully)
against Andrew M. Cuomo. She ordered [a cinnamon raisin
bagel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/11/us/politics/on-politics-cynthia-nixon-interview.html)
with cream cheese, lox and capers — an odd choice she described as
“sweet and salty.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Twitter can be equally perilous. Another New York City mayor, Michael R.
Bloomberg, made a [series of strange
posts](https://nypost.com/2020/01/14/meatball-mike-bloomberg-has-a-weird-night-on-twitter-during-democratic-debate/)
that mostly fell flat on Twitter on Tuesday night during the Democratic
presidential debate.

Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign said it was not hacked and instead was “having
a little fun” since its candidate did not appear at the debate.

The question of whether bagels should be toasted has been debated in New
York City for years. One famed bakery, Murray’s Bagels, [announced
in 2015](https://gothamist.com/food/the-traitors-at-murrays-will-now-toast-transplants-bagels)
that it would toast a bagel upon request, though its leaders believed
the step was not necessary.

The Bagel Hole bakery in Park Slope is a bit sacrosanct about its
nontoasting policy. Its website says it offers only “hand rolled, old
style bagels” baked to a crisp golden brown.

“There’s no need to toast the bagel,” said Philip Romanzi, the owner of
Bagel Hole, who was overseas on Wednesday and missed out on most of the
bagel controversy. “Truthfully, if it’s a fresh bagel, it doesn’t taste
good after you toast it.”

Mr. Romanzi then offered a compromise more befitting a politician.
“Maybe,” he allowed, “you toast it the next day.”
