Toasted bagel? Roasted mayor.

Picking a favorite bagel on National Bagel Day is bound to get any New
York City mayor into trouble with some portion of his 8 million
constituents, who are bound to have differing hard-held opinions.

But Bill de Blasio, following a failed presidential campaign, managed to
cause a particularly unusual uproar.

In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio
\href{https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1217530245672325123}{declared
his love for a bagel} that fits his political persona: the Bagel Hole
bakery in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which serves a chewy and celebrated
variety in the leafy neighborhood where the mayor raised his family.

Then he crossed into treacherous territory for bagel aficionados: He
said his go-to bagel was whole wheat with extra cream cheese. Toasted.

New Yorkers first responded with indignation, asserting that a good
bagel should never be toasted.

Scorn immediately followed: Bagel Hole does not, in fact, toast its
sacred treats.

Mr. de Blasio quickly deleted the post, and added a corrected version
that removed all mention of the word toast.

He seemed to take the kerfuffle in stride, responding to one critic:
``What can I say, I must have a hole in my memory.''

The toasted tumult, which was christened BagelGate on social media,
spawned salty bagel puns and started a conversation about finding the
best bagel in a city known for its culinary hegemony.

There were smears, or perhaps schmears, against his choice and some
defenders cried, ``No one has lox on the subject.''

Elected officials saw an opportunity to step into the bagel leadership
vacuum. Keith Powers, a city councilman in Manhattan, offered a more
popular pick: ``Everything bagel, not toasted, Ess-A-Bagel'' --- another
popular bakery in Manhattan.

Brad Hoylman, a state senator, posted a poll: ``O.K., New York, it's
time to answer the essential question of the day: Is toasting a bagel a
crime?'' As of late afternoon, ``Yes, toasting is a crime'' was losing
to ``No, I like ruining bagels.''

It was not the first dining gaffe for Mr. de Blasio, who was born in New
York but grew up outside Boston.

In 2014, he was famously caught eating pizza with a fork in Staten
Island. He was chastised for not eating the slice with his hands, but
defended his decision.

``In my ancestral homeland, it's more typical to eat with a fork and
knife,'' said Mr. de Blasio, whose mother was Italian.

Eating on the campaign trail is a rite of passage for candidates, but it
can backfire. An ally of the mayor, Cynthia Nixon, was criticized for
her bagel preference in 2018 when she ran for governor (unsuccessfully)
against Andrew M. Cuomo. She ordered
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/11/us/politics/on-politics-cynthia-nixon-interview.html}{a
cinnamon raisin bagel} with cream cheese, lox and capers --- an odd
choice she described as ``sweet and salty.''

Twitter can be equally perilous. Another New York City mayor, Michael R.
Bloomberg, made a
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/01/14/meatball-mike-bloomberg-has-a-weird-night-on-twitter-during-democratic-debate/}{series
of strange posts} that mostly fell flat on Twitter on Tuesday night
during the Democratic presidential debate.

Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said it was not hacked and instead was ``having
a little fun'' since its candidate did not appear at the debate.

The question of whether bagels should be toasted has been debated in New
York City for years. One famed bakery, Murray's Bagels,
\href{https://gothamist.com/food/the-traitors-at-murrays-will-now-toast-transplants-bagels}{announced
in 2015} that it would toast a bagel upon request, though its leaders
believed the step was not necessary.

The Bagel Hole bakery in Park Slope is a bit sacrosanct about its
nontoasting policy. Its website says it offers only ``hand rolled, old
style bagels'' baked to a crisp golden brown.

``There's no need to toast the bagel,'' said Philip Romanzi, the owner
of Bagel Hole, who was overseas on Wednesday and missed out on most of
the bagel controversy. ``Truthfully, if it's a fresh bagel, it doesn't
taste good after you toast it.''

Mr. Romanzi then offered a compromise more befitting a politician.
``Maybe,'' he allowed, ``you toast it the next day.''
