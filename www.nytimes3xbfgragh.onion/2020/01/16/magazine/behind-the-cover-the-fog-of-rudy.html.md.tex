\textbf{Gail Bichler, design director:} ``For this week's cover, a
profile of Rudy Giuliani and his strange path to becoming a shameless
operative, we commissioned the illustrator Andy Friedman to make a
portrait of Giuliani, whose outsize personality is ripe for caricature.
The result is witty and exaggerated, featuring a plume of smoke, wafting
from his cigar, that's meant to nod toward Giuliani and the
administration's penchant for deception.''
