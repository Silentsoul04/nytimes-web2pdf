There are still places in this world --- possibly many of them --- where
people are not always heading somewhere else. John Brandi's delicious
poems in ``The Great Unrest'' carry us around the globe to visit them.
This poem brings us to the far north, in conversation. His traveling
meditational poems are studded by journal entries inscribed around
intricate drawings. One says, ``Remember when `getting somewhere' was
important?'' \emph{Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye}

\emph{By John Brandi}

Wondering\\
if I should look up Freddie,\\
he was pretty old when I met him\\
all those years ago.\\
He could have . . .

So I go down to the river\\
where he used to mend his nets\\
and two Yupik guys\\
repairing an outboard motor,\\
when I ask is Freddie\\
still around,

tip back their caps\\
and smile, looking off\\
toward the sea, putting the question\\
back to me, as one would, having grown\\
up in a village where no one leaves:

Freddie?\\
Still around?\\
Well, where would he go?
