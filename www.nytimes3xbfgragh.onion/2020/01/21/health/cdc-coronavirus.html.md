A man in Washington State is infected with the Wuhan
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/science/ultraviolet-light-coronavirus.html),
the first confirmed case in the United States of a mysterious
respiratory infection that has killed at least six people and sickened
hundreds more in Asia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
announced on Tuesday.

Federal officials also announced expanded screenings for the infection
at major airports in the United States. In addition to New York, Los
Angeles and San Francisco, airports in Atlanta and
[Chicago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html)
will begin examining passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, for signs of
illness.

The infected man, who is in his 30s and a resident of Snohomish County,
Wash., developed symptoms after returning from a trip to the region
around Wuhan where the outbreak
began.

Health officials declined to identify the patient, but said that he has
a mild case of pneumonia, is doing well and has been very cooperative.

Health care workers are also trying to identify people who may have had
contact with the infected traveler, and are notifying some of the
passengers on his return flight who might have been exposed. They will
monitor those fellow passengers for fever and respiratory symptoms.

“We’re very comfortable the patient is isolated and poses little risk to
the staff or general public,” said Dr. Chris Spitters, health officer at
the Snohomish Health District, adding that the strict isolation
practices were implemented in “an abundance of caution.”

News of the first case of the virus in the United States surfaced as
officials studied growing evidence that the disease can be transmitted
from person to person, although it is not clear how easily.

“There is new information hour by hour, day by day, that we are tracking
and following closely,” said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the
C.D.C.’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

The C.D.C. has deployed staff overseas who are working closely with the
ministries of health in China and Thailand. “The key issue we all need
to understand is how easily and sustainably the virus is spread from
human to human,” Dr. Messonnier said.

Federal health officials plan to expand the screening of passengers
arriving in the United States from Wuhan to five airports that are major
international hubs. All travelers from the city will be funneled through
those airports.

Screenings started on Friday and Saturday at New York’s Kennedy
International Airport, San Francisco International and Los Angeles
International. Now they will be expanded to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta
International and Chicago O’Hare International over the next few days.

Passengers from Wuhan planning to arrive in other cities will be issued
new tickets taking them to one of the five screening airports, officials
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday morning
that the Mexican health authorities had identified a possible case in
the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. The patient was “under
observation,” the president said during a news conference.

The patient with the suspected case of coronavirus is a 57-year-old
researcher in a university biotechnology laboratory who lives and works
in Reynosa, a border town that abuts McAllen, Texas, according to
officials in Tamaulipas. The man traveled to China on Dec. 25 and
visited relatives in Wuhan, returning to Mexico on Jan. 10.

In recent days, the man came down with a dry cough and a runny nose, and
decided to report himself to the health authorities, officials said. The
man is now isolated in his house, where he lives alone, and test results
that could confirm a coronavirus infection are expected in the next few
days, said Gloria Molina, the health secretary for Tamaulipas.

The World Health Organization is meeting on Wednesday to decide whether
to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency. But
information about the new virus is still thin, and it’s not clear
whether or how many Americans are at risk.

“There are still more questions that we don’t know the answers to than
things we do know,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of
preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center in Nashville.

“For example, what is the source? We don’t know exactly. The location
likely was the live animal market, but we don’t know the particular
animal.”

The more pressing and urgent question, he said: “How frequent is
human-to-human transmission?”

“Could people with mild infections transmit this virus from person to
person?” he added. “That all remains still under investigation.”

The patient in Washington told doctors that he had not visited the
animal markets in Wuhan, nor had he come into contact with anyone who
was sick.

On Monday, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville changed its
electronic prompts so that any patients coming in to its hospital,
emergency room or clinics with a fever or respiratory symptoms will be
asked whether they have been to China recently or have had contact with
anyone who has recently traveled to China.

Hospitals around the country are likely taking similar steps, Dr.
Schaffner said, in an effort to quickly identify infected patients and
place them in isolation so they can be cared for safely by hospital
workers, and so specimens can be collected for testing.

Dr. Schaffner cautioned anyone traveling to China to avoid visiting live
animal markets and to keep a distance from all live animals, including
domesticated farm animals. Travelers to China should practice [lots of
good hand
hygiene](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/21/health/washing-hands.html),
he added, and do their best to avoid anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
