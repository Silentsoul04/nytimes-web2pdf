A man in Washington State is infected with a new respiratory virus.
Federal officials plan to expand screenings for the infection at major
airports.

A man in Washington State is infected with the Wuhan
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/science/ultraviolet-light-coronavirus.html}{coronavirus},
the first confirmed case in the United States of a mysterious
respiratory infection that has killed at least six people and sickened
hundreds more in Asia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
announced on Tuesday.

Federal officials also announced expanded screenings for the infection
at major airports in the United States. In addition to New York, Los
Angeles and San Francisco, airports in Atlanta and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html}{Chicago}
will begin examining passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, for signs of
illness.

The infected man, who is in his 30s and a resident of Snohomish County,
Wash., developed symptoms after returning from a trip to the region
around Wuhan where the outbreak began.

The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number
of other countries.

He returned from Wuhan on Jan. 15, two days before passenger screening
was instituted at three major airports in the United States, but he had
no symptoms at the time.

He read online about the mysterious new virus that causes fever and
respiratory illness, and informed his doctors about his recent trip when
he sought care on Sunday, federal officials said.

He was seen at a clinic in Snohomish County and is now hospitalized at
Providence Regional Medical Center-Everett. Specimens from the patient
were sent to the C.D.C. in Atlanta, and officials confirmed on Monday
that he was infected with the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html}{Wuhan
coronavirus}, also called 2019-nCoV.

Health officials declined to identify the patient, but said that he has
a mild case of pneumonia, is doing well and has been very cooperative.

Health care workers are also trying to identify people who may have had
contact with the infected traveler, and are notifying some of the
passengers on his return flight who might have been exposed. They will
monitor those fellow passengers for fever and respiratory symptoms.

``We're very comfortable the patient is isolated and poses little risk
to the staff or general public,'' said Dr. Chris Spitters, health
officer at the Snohomish Health District, adding that the strict
isolation practices were implemented in ``an abundance of caution.''

News of the first case of the virus in the United States surfaced as
officials studied growing evidence that the disease can be transmitted
from person to person, although it is not clear how easily.

``There is new information hour by hour, day by day, that we are
tracking and following closely,'' said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of
the C.D.C.'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

The C.D.C. has deployed staff overseas who are working closely with the
ministries of health in China and Thailand. ``The key issue we all need
to understand is how easily and sustainably the virus is spread from
human to human,'' Dr. Messonnier said.

Federal health officials plan to expand the screening of passengers
arriving in the United States from Wuhan to five airports that are major
international hubs. All travelers from the city will be funneled through
those airports.

Screenings started on Friday and Saturday at New York's Kennedy
International Airport, San Francisco International and Los Angeles
International. Now they will be expanded to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta
International and Chicago O'Hare International over the next few days.

Passengers from Wuhan planning to arrive in other cities will be issued
new tickets taking them to one of the five screening airports, officials
said.

The outbreak, which began in December in a seafood and poultry market in
Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is spreading: Patients have been identified
in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as Taiwan, Japan, Thailand
and South Korea.

On Tuesday, Chinese authorities confirmed that six people have died of
the infection in Wuhan. Nearly 300 cases have been reported to date in
China, and federal health officials said that number is likely to grow.
Many of the patients lived in or traveled to Wuhan.

In Mexico, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday morning
that the Mexican health authorities had identified a possible case in
the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. The patient was ``under
observation,'' the president said during a news conference.

The patient with the suspected case of coronavirus is a 57-year-old
researcher in a university biotechnology laboratory who lives and works
in Reynosa, a border town that abuts McAllen, Texas, according to
officials in Tamaulipas. The man traveled to China on Dec. 25 and
visited relatives in Wuhan, returning to Mexico on Jan. 10.

In recent days, the man came down with a dry cough and a runny nose, and
decided to report himself to the health authorities, officials said. The
man is now isolated in his house, where he lives alone, and test results
that could confirm a coronavirus infection are expected in the next few
days, said Gloria Molina, the health secretary for Tamaulipas.

The World Health Organization is meeting on Wednesday to decide whether
to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency. But
information about the new virus is still thin, and it's not clear
whether or how many Americans are at risk.

``There are still more questions that we don't know the answers to than
things we do know,'' said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of
preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center in Nashville.

``For example, what is the source? We don't know exactly. The location
likely was the live animal market, but we don't know the particular
animal.''

The more pressing and urgent question, he said: ``How frequent is
human-to-human transmission?''

``Could people with mild infections transmit this virus from person to
person?'' he added. ``That all remains still under investigation.''

The patient in Washington told doctors that he had not visited the
animal markets in Wuhan, nor had he come into contact with anyone who
was sick.

On Monday, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville changed its
electronic prompts so that any patients coming in to its hospital,
emergency room or clinics with a fever or respiratory symptoms will be
asked whether they have been to China recently or have had contact with
anyone who has recently traveled to China.

Hospitals around the country are likely taking similar steps, Dr.
Schaffner said, in an effort to quickly identify infected patients and
place them in isolation so they can be cared for safely by hospital
workers, and so specimens can be collected for testing.

Dr. Schaffner cautioned anyone traveling to China to avoid visiting live
animal markets and to keep a distance from all live animals, including
domesticated farm animals. Travelers to China should practice
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/21/health/washing-hands.html}{lots
of good hand hygiene}, he added, and do their best to avoid anyone who
is coughing or sneezing.
