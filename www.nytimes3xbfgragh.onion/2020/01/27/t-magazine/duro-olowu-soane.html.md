When the Nigerian-born fashion designer [Duro
Olowu](https://www.duroolowu.com/) found himself with time to spare
between meetings one winter evening in London two years ago, he decided
to take a walk down the Pimlico Road. Nestled between the residential
districts of Chelsea and Belgravia, the charmingly old-fashioned street,
lined with Victorian-era galleries and storefronts, is home to esteemed
English interior design firms such as Colefax & Fowler, Rose Uniacke and
Robert Kime. Along the way, Olowu, who splits his time between London
and New York, was stopped in his tracks by an opulent window display at
[Soane Britain](https://www.soane.co.uk/), the 23-year-old furniture,
lighting and fabric maker that is particularly renowned for reviving
disappearing artisanal techniques such as
[rattan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/15/t-magazine/design/wicker-furniture-larsson-korgmakare-soane-bonacina.html).

“I was totally taken aback,” he says of the lavish living room scene,
which featured matching linen curtains, wallpaper and the brand’s
popular ’40s-style armless Tuileries sofa, all patterned with the
lattice-like botanical swirls of Lotus Palmette, a Soane print inspired
by a 16th-century Safavid silk velvet panel. “It spoke to me in the same
way that a museum or a gallery display would. At the same time,
everything just looked so warm and comfortable.” When Olowu shared a
picture of the window on Instagram that night, his post caught the
attention of Lulu Lytle, Soane’s co-founder and creative director. Lytle
had been an admirer of Olowu’s own vividly colorful patterns since
buying a suit from his first boutique in Notting Hill, right **** around
the same time she helped to establish Soane in 1997. She wrote an
impassioned message to Olowu in reply, and so began a creative
relationship that will culminate, on March 2, with the debut of four
printed and woven interior fabrics that unite Soane’s peerless
craftsmanship with Olowu’s wide-ranging
influences.

“We just talked and talked,” says Lytle of the pair’s meetings at both
her home in Bayswater and Olowu’s store, a former gallery space in
London’s St. James’s neighborhood with walls and furnishings covered in
a colorful array of **** printed textiles, some designed by him and
others — including the curtains from his sister’s childhood bedroom —
collected on his frequent trips to Africa. Olowu’s clothes are similarly
**** vibrant; his line, which he founded in 2004, consists of dresses
and tailoring made from materials including vintage couture fabrics,
French furniture upholstery and textiles of his own design. “We share
very similar inspirations,” Lytle says of Olowu, “such as a love of
Egypt, right down to a fascination with scarab beetles.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Accordingly, the collaboration was founded on a shared obsession with
antique textiles. Lytle, who as a teenager once blew her savings on a
large piece of appliquéd ’20s-era Egyptian cloth she’d found at an
antiques store, established Soane’s fabric division in 2011 and often
finds inspiration in her extensive personal archive, which includes
textiles ranging from 18th-century British shawls to Middle Eastern
prayer mats, Moroccan weavings to Syrian silks. Olowu is similarly
smitten. “I’ve always loved textiles,” he says. “If I ever have spare
cloth from my collections, I’ll use it to cover a chair or a cushion —
people go crazy over it. I’ve made pieces on commission for homes in
Basel, New York and London.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Drawing on motifs from Persian, Nigerian and Senegalese textiles, Olowu
created a series of rough gouache sketches, layering them up, pattern on
pattern. Lytle had given him carte blanche, and so the real challenge
was whittling things **** down to just four designs. Eventually, they
landed on Timbuktu and Koro, a pair of patterns whose geometric shapes
were inspired by the jutting silhouettes of Malian mosques, as well as
two finely engraved rotary prints: Regency Swirl, which evokes the
curlicues of wrought-iron fencing, and Stencil Leaf, whose densely
packed fronds pay homage to the sprawling topiary at the Arts and
Crafts-style garden of Hidcote Manor in Gloucestershire, England, close
to where Lytle grew up.

“They’re strong but subtle,” says Lytle of the prints, which will be
available at Soane Britain stores in 11 colors and can be custom made in
even more hues. “The great litmus test for textiles is to think of how
many interiors you could incorporate them into.” It’s an exercise that
underlines the pair’s different creative domains: While Olowu pictures
the Stencil Leaf print on a bathrobe, Lytle imagines it enveloping an
entire room**,** from floor to ceiling. “It’s more a question,” she
says, “of where I won’t use them.”
