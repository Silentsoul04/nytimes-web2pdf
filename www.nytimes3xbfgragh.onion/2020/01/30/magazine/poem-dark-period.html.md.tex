Plays on words and tiny twists mean much in a poem. In ``Lean Against
This Late Hour,'' his mesmerizing seventh collection of poems, Garous
Abdolmalekian makes us wonder: What if we could put a period on an
entire period? Turn a corner, change the tune? And who is that little
disappearing girl we barely see --- what world is she being given?
Something calms in the simple repetition of a word or thought and the
hopeful conviction of ``there will be.''

By Garous Abdolmalekian

In this line\\
or the next one\\
there will be a period,\\
an end to all the words.

Within the stark frame of the window,\\
tired silhouettes\\
and the dark dress\\
of a little girl growing distant\\
 growing distant\\
 growing distant

In the stark frame of the window\\
a dark period\\
grows distant.

A period\\
that is the end to all the words.
