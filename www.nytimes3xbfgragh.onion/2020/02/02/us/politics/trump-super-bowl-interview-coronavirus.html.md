# Trump Defends Closing Borders to Travelers to Fight Coronavirus

</div>

In an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, President Trump insulted
his potential 2020 rivals, lamented impeachment and defended his
administration’s coronavirus policies.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump defended a decision that would
[bar foreign nationals who had recently visited
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html)
from entering the United States as his administration continued to
assess the growing threat of a coronavirus outbreak.

Sitting with the Fox News personality Sean Hannity, Mr. Trump used a
roughly nine-minute interview taped on Saturday evening at Mar-a-Lago,
his private club in Florida, and broadcast on Sunday as an opportunity
to condense his usual rally-speak into Super Bowl pregame chatter. The
topics included the virus, his impeachment and quick-paced insults of
his potential 2020 rivals.

“We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,” Mr. Trump said of
the coronavirus. “But we can’t have thousands of people coming in who
may have this problem, the coronavirus. We’re going to see what happens,
but we did shut it down, yes.”

He said his administration was offering the Chinese “tremendous help” to
contain the spread of the virus. On Sunday afternoon, the administration
put into effect a rule that would also essentially quarantine American
travelers who had visited China within the past two weeks, diverting
them to seven airports “to implement enhanced screening procedures,”
according to guidelines issued Sunday by the Department of Homeland
Security.

There have been seven confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States,
but no deaths.

Earlier in the day, Robert C. O’Brien, Mr. Trump’s national security
adviser, appeared on television to advise Americans that there was “no
reason to panic” about the spread of the virus. Indeed, during his Fox
sit-down, both Mr. Trump and his interviewer seemed more interested in
allowing the president to focus on his grievances over impeachment and
his re-election effort rather than elaborate on a global public health
crisis.

“It’s been very unfair from the day I won,” Mr. Trump said. “Mostly it
was unfair to my family.”

He derided the impeachment effort as “a hoax” and said he had not
thought to delay his annual State of the Union address before the
culmination this week of his Senate trial — an expected acquittal that
Mr. Hannity framed as a “fait accompli.”

Mr. Trump then spent a large part of the interview insulting a slate of
potential Democratic rivals. He and Mr. Hannity played a lightning round
where Mr. Hannity invited the president to say whatever came to mind
about Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts,
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former
mayor of New York.

Mr. Trump falsely called Mr. Sanders a “communist” and claimed that he
had been married in Russia.

“I think of communism when I think of Bernie,” Mr. Trump said. “Didn’t
he get married in Moscow?”

Mr. Sanders married in Burlington, Vt., [before traveling to the Soviet
Union](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-bernie-sanderss-1988-10-day-honeymoon-in-the-soviet-union/2019/05/02/db543e18-6a9c-11e9-a66d-a82d3f3d96d5_story.html)
soon after, and the trip has been used as fodder by his critics as
evidence that he has communist leanings.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At one point, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that Mr. Bloomberg had requested
a “box” to stand on should he attend a Democratic debate, a comment that
drew sharp rebukes from both Mr. Bloomberg and his spokeswoman, Julie
Wood, who called the president a “pathological liar who lies about
everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.”

Mr. Trump also called Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who oversaw the impeachment
effort into his presidency, a “very confused, very nervous woman,”
adding that Ms. Pelosi would not last in office: “I think the radical
left is going to take over.”
