# Why the New Coronavirus (Mostly) Spares Children

So far, very few young children seem to be falling ill. The pattern was
seen in outbreaks of SARS and MERS, too.

The new coronavirus has infected nearly 90,000 people, and more than
3,000 have died. But relatively few
[children](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-children-icu.html)
appear to have developed severe symptoms so far, according to available
data.

“Disease in children appears to be relatively rare and mild,” with those
under 19 years making up only 2.4 percent of the total cases, according
to a
[report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf)
published Feb. 28 by the World Health Organization.

So why aren’t more children getting sick?

“My strong, educated guess is that younger people are getting infected,
but they get the relatively milder disease,” Dr. Malik Peiris, chief of
virology at the University of Hong Kong, said last month. Dr. Peiris has
developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus.

The numbers so far support that theory: According to the W.H.O., only
2.5 percent of those under 19 have developed severe disease and only 0.2
percent had critical disease. There have been no deaths recorded in
children under 9.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Scientists may not be seeing more infected children because “we don’t
have data on the milder cases,” Dr. Peiris said.

Without more information, it is also unclear whether
[children](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/health/coronavirus-children-icu.html)
can transmit the disease to others. The W.H.O. report said that its team
sent to China, the epicenter of the outbreak, “could not recall episodes
in which transmission occurred from a child to an adult.”

Still, children who are detected as infected must be shedding some virus
or they wouldn’t be detected, noted Dr. Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist
at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But whether their
infectiousness is high is as yet unknown. “It’s a very high priority to
do studies to find it out,” he
said.

One way to find out, he said, is to look at outbreaks such as the one at
the church in South Korea. “If there were children among those people,”
he said, “that would be a goldmine of data.”

The other approach is to conduct household studies, where multiple
members of a family might be infected.

In one such published case study of a family, a 10-year-old traveled to
Wuhan, China, with his family. Upon returning to Shenzhen, the other
infected family members, ranging in age from 36 to 66, [developed fever,
sore throat, diarrhea and
pneumonia](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30154-9/fulltext).

The child, too, had signs of viral pneumonia in the lungs, doctors found
— but no outward symptoms. Some scientists suspect that this is typical
of coronavirus infection in children.

“It’s certainly true that children can be either asymptomatically
infected or have very mild infection,” Dr. Raina MacIntyre said last
month. Dr. MacIntyre is an epidemiologist at the University of New South
Wales in Sydney, Australia, who has been studying the spread of the new
coronavirus.

In many ways, this pattern parallels that seen during outbreaks of SARS
and MERS, also coronaviruses. The MERS epidemics in Saudi Arabia in 2012
and in South Korea in 2015 together claimed more than 800 lives. Most
children who were infected never developed symptoms.

No children died during the SARS epidemic in 2003, and the majority of
the 800 deaths in the outbreak were in people over age 45, with men more
at risk.

Among the more than 8,000 cases of SARS, researchers at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention were able to identify 135 infected
children in published reports.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Children under age 12 were much less likely to be admitted to a hospital
or to need oxygen or other treatment, the researchers found. Children
over age 12 had symptoms much like those of adults.

“We don’t fully understand the reason for this age-related increase of
severity,” Dr. Peiris said. “But we see that now — and with SARS, you
could see that much more clearly.”

It’s not unusual for viruses to trigger only mild infections in children
and much more severe illnesses in adults. Chickenpox, for example, can
be largely inconsequential in children, yet catastrophic in
adults.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Influenza is unusual in that it has evolved with humans over thousands
of years and infects millions worldwide each year. Still, even though
thousands of young children end up in the hospital each year with
influenza, just a small percentage of them die, said Dr. Krys Johnson,
an epidemiologist at Temple University in Philadelphia.

This trend is generally true of respiratory illnesses because children
tend to eat well, and to get plenty of exercise and rest — none of which
may be true of adults. “The younger, most healthy segment of the
population are able to fight it off,” she said. Adults may also be more
susceptible because they are more likely to have other diseases, such as
diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease, that weaken their
ability to stave off infections.

The body’s innate immunity, which is critical for fighting viruses, also
deteriorates with age, and particularly after middle age.

“Something happens at age 50,” Dr. MacIntyre said. “It declines, and it
declines exponentially, which is why for most infections we see the
highest incidence in the elderly.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A key question about the new coronavirus is whether children who are
infected and asymptomatic are able to pass the virus to others.

“We know that young people in general — not just kids, but young adults
and teenagers — have the most intense contact in society,” Dr. MacIntyre
said. Young people who don’t realize they are sick may contribute to the
epidemic’s momentum, she said.

To understand the epidemic fully, she and other scientists said they
need detailed data: when people were first exposed to the virus, when
they first began to show symptoms, how many and which people have mild
symptoms versus more severe disease.

With detailed data, some observations, such as the higher risk in men,
may change. Still, Dr. Mark Denison, a pediatric infectious diseases
specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, said last month that
he does not expect to see a sudden uptick in infected children.
