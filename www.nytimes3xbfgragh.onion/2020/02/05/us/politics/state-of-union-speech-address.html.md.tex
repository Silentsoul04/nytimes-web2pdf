\section{Six Takeaways From Trump's State of the Union
Address}\label{six-takeaways-from-trumps-state-of-the-union-address}}

President Trump framed his third year in office as an unmistakable
success and his fourth as more of the same. But one word was left out of
his speech: ``impeachment.''

Roughly two weeks after his impeachment trial began, President Trump
claimed the Capitol Hill spotlight on his own terms Tuesday night,
delivering his third
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/podcasts/the-daily/state-of-the-union.html}{State
of the Union} address in front of a Congress set to acquit him on
Wednesday.

A partisan atmosphere loomed over the House floor from the very start of
Mr. Trump's speech, when Republican lawmakers chanted ``four more
years'' after the president stepped up to the rostrum. The hostility
carried through to the end, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/04/us/politics/pelosi-trump-handshake.html}{ripped
up} a copy of the address after he finished delivering it.

But Mr. Trump, who spoke at the same spot where Ms. Pelosi
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeached.html}{announced}
the articles of impeachment, made no mention of the news of the day.
Instead, he proclaimed that the economy was setting records, that
American enemies were on the defense, and that the American spirit had
been renewed.

``In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American
decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny,'' he
said. ``We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a
short time ago and we are never going back.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/02/04/us/politics/04dc-trump1-sub/merlin_168401274_29054352-3652-48c0-91fc-0d0d12bee2d4-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg}

Here are six takeaways from Mr. Trump's speech.

\hypertarget{mr-trumps-first-point-of-order-was-all-about-the-economy}{%
\subsection{Mr. Trump's first point of order was all about the
economy.}\label{mr-trumps-first-point-of-order-was-all-about-the-economy}}

Mr. Trump dived into the state of the economy at the top of the speech,
making broad declarations about tax cuts, deregulation and the
renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the new
version of which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/29/business/economy/usmca-trump.html}{he
signed into law last week}.

He correctly pointed out that the unemployment rate was the lowest in
half a century. But he incorrectly claimed that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/fact-check-state-of-the-union-02-04\#from-the-instant-i-took-office-i-moved-rapidly-to-revive-the-us-economy-slashing-a-record-number-of-job-killing-regulations-enac}{he
had enacted} ``record-setting tax cuts,'' that the economy
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/fact-check-state-of-the-union-02-04\#our-economy-is-the-best-it-has-ever-been}{was
``the best it has ever been''} and that stock markets have ``soared 70
percent,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/fact-check-state-of-the-union-02-04\#since-my-election-us-stock-markets-have-soared-70-percent-adding-more-than-12-trillion-to-our-nations-wealth-transcending-anythi}{exaggerating
the real percentage}. He also took undue credit when
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/fact-check-state-of-the-union-02-04\#thanks-to-our-bold-regulatory-reduction-campaign-the-united-states-has-become-the-no-1-producer-of-oil-and-natural-gas-anywhere-}{he
claimed} that the United States had become the top producer of oil and
natural gas in the world, thanks to a ``bold regulatory reduction
campaign.''

Mr. Trump's boasts came at a time of surging economic optimism. Forty
percent of Americans say they are now better off financially than they
were at the same time last year, according to
\href{https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/nyt-january-2020-cci/}{a
survey conducted last month} for The New York Times.

Yet the public attitude belies harsher truths:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/04/business/economy/trump-economy-state-of-the-union.html}{Economic
improvement has slowed} in blue-collar, ``middle-wage'' sectors. By most
conventional measures, including wage growth for typical workers and the
growth rate of the economy, the economy is far from the best ever, as
Mr. Trump argued on Tuesday.

\hypertarget{among-the-few-legislative-proposals-health-care}{%
\subsection{Among the few legislative proposals: health
care.}\label{among-the-few-legislative-proposals-health-care}}

Mr. Trump addressed two pieces of potential health care legislation that
remain a top priority for both parties in the coming months: surprise
billing and prescription drugs.

He said that he had spoken with Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of
Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to urge him to
pass legislation that lowers the price of prescription drugs.

``Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately,'' Mr.
Trump declared, as Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services
secretary, looked in the direction of Democrats in the room.

Mr. Trump also mentioned
\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-price-quality-transparency-american-healthcare-put-patients-first/}{an
executive order} he signed in June requiring ``price transparency,'' an
attempt to curb the phenomenon of surprise billing at hospitals, when
patients unexpectedly receive care from doctors outside of their
insurance networks.

  So it is 8:40 p.m. Tuesday night. I have just arrived in Washington,
  D.C. from Des Moines, Iowa, where I was covering the Iowa caucuses.
  That was a mess. Now we are in The Times's Washington bureau to cover
  President Trump's final State of the Union of his first term. And I'm
  standing outside a giant conference room, where about two to three
  dozen reporters and editors are gathered to watch, analyze and
  fact-check the president's speech. And we are headed into that room to
  kind of observe it all and to eat the barbecue that has been laid out
  there.

  So the center of this room is a giant television screen tuned to CNN,
  which is carrying a view of the House chamber and lawmakers walking
  in, shaking each other's hands and taking their seats. And it is
  panning up to show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike
  Pence looking friendly, surprisingly friendly. How long is this speech
  going to be?

  We're anticipating about an hour and a half.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''
Today: The president's third State of the Union address. Maggie Haberman
on what it tells us.

It's Wednesday, February 5.

Maggie, it feels very hard to separate this State of the Union address
from the moment in which it's being delivered --- the day after Iowa
kicked off the 2020 election to pick Donald Trump's Democratic opponent.
And the day before the president faces a verdict in the Senate
impeachment trial, which has put together quite a backdrop.

maggie haberman

Absolutely. And if you did not know that this was the State of the Union
address, it felt like a campaign rally at the very beginning.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

The president walks into the House chamber, and there's a very MAGA
feeling right away, as Republicans are clamoring to try to shake his
hand.

michael barbaro

MAGA, Make America Great Again?

maggie haberman

Make America Great Again, the president's slogan. The president then
goes to the podium, and he hands Nancy Pelosi text of his speech. And
she engages in what is a typical gesture, which is extends her hand to
shake his. And he turns his back to her. And she quickly pulled her hand
back, but the tone was then set.

michael barbaro

Right. And that was the moment where it felt like impeachment suddenly
was present.

maggie haberman

Yes. Impeachment was basically hanging over the entire event like a
curtain. And it never lifted. And then, Pelosi had her own dig.
Traditionally, speakers of the House introduce the president by
describing themselves as having the high privilege and distinct honor of
presenting to you the president of the United States.

michael barbaro

Right.

maggie haberman

That's not what Pelosi did this time.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\item
  archived recording (nancy pelosi)\\
  Members of Congress, the president of the United States.
  {[}CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

She said, ``Members of Congress, the president of the United States.''
And that was all Donald Trump got.

michael barbaro

And so basically, none of the honor, none of the pleasure, none of the
distinct honor and pleasure.

maggie haberman

None of the words that are normally described as being attached to the
dignity of this office. She chose not to do that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}CHANTING{]} Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four
  more years!
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And then there was this return to the campaign theme, where even before
he started speaking, Republicans in the chamber started chanting ``four
more years.''

michael barbaro

O.K. So after that score settling, the speech begins.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are
  building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

That's right. And the president pretty quickly launched into essentially
an advertisement for why he should be re-elected.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S.
  economy.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

It was that the future has never been so bright. He was speaking in very
grand terms about America.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth and most
  of all, pro-American.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

He described himself as essentially creating a much better America than
the one he found.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous
  administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great
  economic success. {[}CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And then he launched into exactly why that was.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs --- 5 million
  more than government experts projected during the previous
  administration.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And much of what he seemed to be talking about here is the economy.

maggie haberman

That's right. He talked about creating enormous numbers of jobs since he
took office. He described it all as record-breaking. He talked about the
unemployment rate being incredibly low.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

He talked about helping specific groups of people ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70
  years.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

--- specifically women ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  The unemployment rate for African-Americans ---
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

--- specifically African-Americans, specifically Hispanic Americans and
Asian-Americans.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  --- and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels in history.
  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

These are groups, not coincidentally, whose support he would like in his
re-election.

michael barbaro

So he's seizing on economic data that specifically targets key
constituencies for his re-election.

maggie haberman

Correct. These are key demographic groups where he has seen his support
since 2016 really go down, and where he needs to see it go back up. He
doesn't have to win them overall as blocs of voters, but he does have to
shave off just enough from Democrats in specific states where he can
win. And his advisers have told him the economy is his strongest calling
card for re-election. And he clearly had that in mind as he stuck to
this speech.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  In eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age
  people dropped out of the workforce. In just three years of my
  administration, 3.5 million people, working-age people, have joined
  the workforce. {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And can the president take credit for all the economic data points he
rattled off? And were they all accurate?

maggie haberman

There was definitely some fudging of numbers here or there. But the
overall picture that he painted was as if he came in right after the
fiscal crisis. It was actually Barack Obama who came in after the fiscal
crisis and who did start the economic recovery. Now this president has
continued it. There is no question that he is overseeing a booming
economy. But where it started, and how it got to where it is now, is a
story where he paints it in an overly rosy light for himself.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  This is a blue collar boom.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

So he kind of excises the eight years of Barack Obama.

maggie haberman

Correct. We go a bit from `08 to now, as if there was nothing in between
except for his presidency.

michael barbaro

O.K. So where does the president go next?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to
  give her daughter a better future.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

So then he started pointing to people who were in the crowd, in the
gallery, attending as guests of him or the first lady.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  But Janiyah, I have some good news for you. Because I am pleased to
  inform you that your long wait is over.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And he took it to a different level that we haven't seen before, which
was much more the reality TV level, and the showman, and the star of
``The Apprentice.'' There was a young girl who was given a scholarship,
part of a new program that the White House is launching.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  And you will soon be heading to this school of your choice.
  {[}CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

This emphasized school choice. It emphasized his concerns about public
schools. And she happened to be young and African-American.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is
  diagnosed with a serious illness.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

The blow away moment for a lot of people was he pointed to Rush Limbaugh
---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our
  country.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

--- the conservative radio host who announced this week that he has lung
cancer, advanced lung cancer ---

michael barbaro

Right.

maggie haberman

--- who clearly looked frail standing next to the first lady.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our
  country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
  {[}CHEERING{]}
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And the president not only announced that he was giving him the Medal of
Freedom, which is an incredibly high honor ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with
  the honor, please.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

He had the first lady literally put the medal on Rush Limbaugh.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}CHEERING{]} I don't think we've ever seen one given at the State of
  the Union before.
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Rush and Kathryn, congratulations. Thank you, Kathryn.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And this was really tapping into this base of conservative radio
listeners, conservative media ecosystem supporters who the president
has, and who he has relied on since 2016.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  {[}APPLAUSE{]} War places a heavy burden on our nation's extraordinary
  military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort
  Bragg, North Carolina.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And then there was the most gut-wrenching one, which was the president
pointed to the wife of a soldier who was in the gallery. And he told her
that he knew that her husband had been overseas.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband,
  Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams is in Afghanistan on his fourth
  deployment in the Middle East. Amy's kids haven't seen their father's
  face in many months.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And the big reveal was ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  But, Amy, there is one more thing. Tonight we have a very special
  surprise.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

--- the doors to the gallery opened.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment.
  He is here with us tonight. {[}CHEERING{]} And we couldn't keep him
  waiting any longer.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And he came down the stairs, and there he was.

michael barbaro

The soldier.

maggie haberman

The soldier. And there was this surprise reunion that he was now home.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. Thank you very much.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Right, which is the stuff of kind of daytime television, Oprah-style,
heart-wrenching, beautiful reunions of soldiers and their spouses, but
not typically State of the Union.

maggie haberman

Oprah was literally what was going through my mind, and I think a lot of
other people's minds, when we saw this taking place.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}CHANTING{]} USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

You know, up to this point, Maggie, this is a pretty upbeat and positive
speech at times, whether you thought it was over the top and like
reality TV, or not ---

maggie haberman

That's right.

michael barbaro

--- and very genuine moment of tenderness.

maggie haberman

That's right. There were moments of tenderness. There were moments of
humanity. There were moments of what was clearly genuine heartfelt
emotion on the part of the people in the gallery. The president stuck to
the teleprompter. He didn't go off on his tangents as he often does. It
was generally a pretty positive speech up to a specific point.

{[}music{]}

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

{[}music{]}

michael barbaro

Maggie, you said that the State of the Union was positive up to a point.
What was that point?

maggie haberman

That point was when he started going after Democrats in the chamber, and
Democrats outside the chamber who are running against him for president.

michael barbaro

And how did he do that?

maggie haberman

He started going after socialism, which has been a word he's been using
a lot.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against
  the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Right. There's a point where the president reaches out into the audience
---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Here this evening is a very brave man.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- and points to Juan Guaidó, who is a legislative leader in Venezuela
---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of
  Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Mr. President ---
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- and says, you are the legitimate leader of that country. And then
all of a sudden, he mentions socialism in a way that doesn't necessarily
seem like it's about Venezuela so much as perhaps the United States.

maggie haberman

Correct. He says, ``Socialism destroys nations.''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Socialism destroys nations, but always remember, freedom unifies the
  soul.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

Now that's a reference to Venezuela. Then he starts talking about health
care in the U.S.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  A good life for American families also requires the most affordable,
  innovative and high-quality health care system on Earth.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

And what he's talking about, without saying it explicitly, but he's
talking about the debate within the Democratic primary for president
about the type of health care system the U.S. should have.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  But as we work to improve Americans' health care, there are those who
  want to take away your health care, take away your doctor and abolish
  private insurance entirely. {[}BOOING{]}
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

He's talking about folks like Bernie Sanders, the Democratic socialist,
who believes in an expansive government health care program. And
President Trump was arguing against that, but in a very, very forceful
way.

So after laying out a blueprint for his re-election, it feels like this
part of the speech is kind of frontal assault on the left wing of the
Democratic Party and the left wing presidential candidates who he's
going to face, potentially.

maggie haberman

He's very much laying out the message of why it is that those people are
not safe choices. He doesn't know who his opponent is going to be yet,
but he is trying to paint every Democratic candidate with the brush of
socialism. And that is what you are going to see for the next nine
months. And this was the beginning of that path.

michael barbaro

What's interesting about this speech, as a political document in the
moment we're in --- the beginning of the 2020 election --- is that the
president is not just seemingly appealing to conservatives with giving
Rush Limbaugh a medal, for example, or attacking presidential candidates
in the Democratic Party as radical left wing figures. He also seemed to
be reaching out to moderates, with specific policy proposals.

maggie haberman

Right.

  To protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United
  States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious

maggie haberman

There were a trillion trees. There was the child tax credit.

There was prescription drug prices.

  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

Those were middle-of-the-road, moderate proposals that would appeal to
suburban voters who have been turned off by him. And then there was this
very hard pivot to immigration, where he talked about ICE agents making
arrests.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal
  aliens, charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults,
  45,000 violent assaults and 2,000 murders.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

He referred to quote-unquote criminal aliens. He talked about protecting
the borders.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New
  York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old
  woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault. But under
  New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had
  honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would still be alive today.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

This was some of the harshest rhetoric in his speech. But juxtaposed
against everything else he said, it was almost like a menu of options
where different voters could hear what they wanted to hear, in his
words.

michael barbaro

What do you make of that, going from a child tax credit and planting a
trillion trees, to harsh language about undocumented immigrants?

maggie haberman

This is a pretty nonideological president. He doesn't have a clear
through-line on what he thinks. And he has consistently --- since we
have covered him in the campaign prior to his becoming president --- he
has often said things that appear contradictory. But they allow
different people to hear what they want in what he's saying. And if
there was one thing that made them comfortable, he's going to hope
they'll ignore the rest.

michael barbaro

So Maggie, we started off talking about how the context here was
election and impeachment. So I want to return to the idea of
impeachment. Correct me if I'm wrong. The president managed to get
through a 90-minute speech without either mentioning impeachment or
making any veiled references to impeachment.

maggie haberman

It was really striking, Michael. We had heard earlier in the day that
the president was not going to mention impeachment in this speech. He
had apparently told the network anchors at a lunch he held with them at
the White House that he wanted to speak about it after the vote on
Wednesday. But it was really striking that he kept from mentioning it.
He's so known for going off script. He never did.

michael barbaro

Why not?

maggie haberman

I think because it's not something he's proud of, and I think because he
wants to keep it separate from this, which is supposed to be the
argument for re-electing him. And impeachment is not part of that. This
was a laundry list of accomplishments. And this was a case for why his
opponents aren't as good as he is. And if you take away all of the
tweeting, and the things he says, and the attacking his rivals --- if
you took all of that away, he would be much higher in terms of approval
ratings than where he is now. But where he is today is 49\% in the
Gallup poll. That's pretty high for where he's been. He doesn't need to
bring that down by reminding people that he was impeached. So he doesn't
bring it up. But at the end of the speech ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (donald trump)\\
  Our spirit is still young. The sun is still rising. God's grace is
  still shining.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

--- it sort of felt like Nancy Pelosi did.

michael barbaro

What do you mean?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

  The best is yet to come. {[}APPLAUSE{]} Thank you. God bless you. And
  God bless America. Thank you very much.
\end{itemize}

maggie haberman

As the president was taking in his final applause and said thank you,
she immediately started putting together the pages of his speech that he
had handed her. And she started systematically tearing them up as the
cameras rolled.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

  {[}APPLAUSE{]}
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And what did you read into that moment?

maggie haberman

Well, I read into that moment that she was pretty angry about how he had
acted. I think she was pretty angry about the speech. And I think she
wanted to telegraph that. She's going to face some blowback for that. I
think she already is. But I think it was a moment that her members for
the most part agreed with.

michael barbaro

Right. In the final moment of this State of the Union, it's like we're
seeing the spectacle of what this presidential race and the next seven,
eight, nine months are going to look like. President Trump, it seems,
may not want to be talking about impeachment. He wants to just move on
and run on a record. And Democrats, people like Nancy Pelosi, they want
to be talking about things like impeachment.

maggie haberman

Nancy Pelosi likes to say that even with a Senate acquittal, which we
expect to happen, clearly, he's impeached for life. That's on his record
forever. The president will try not to talk about it, or he'll try to
talk about it when it serves him. He'll try to use it to gin up his
supporters and get them going at rallies. But in general, this is not a
topic he wants to go near. And I don't think she's going to let him not
talk about it.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. And so of course will his Democratic opponents.

maggie haberman

Right. His Democratic opponents are not about to let this go. And
impeachment might be over as a trial, but it's not going to be over as a
concept for the next nine months.

Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday night, after a major

The next Democratic contest will be held in New Hampshire next week. And
the Senate trial of President Trump will reconvene today at 4 p.m., at
which point senators are expected to acquit him on two articles of
impeachment in a party line vote.

{[}music{]}

That's it for ``The Daily.'' I'm Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

Rush Limbaugh, the pro-Trump conservative radio host who recently
announced that he has lung cancer, sat next to Melania Trump, the first
lady, who presented him with a surprise award, the Presidential Medal of
Freedom. Mrs. Trump hung the medal around Mr. Limbaugh's neck as
Republicans gave him a standing ovation. Overwhelmed, Mr. Limbaugh
clasped his hands and closed his eyes.

Sitting nearby was a collection of guests representative of some of Mr.
Trump's pet issues: a border patrol agent and the brother of a man
killed by an undocumented immigrant.

He used their presence to rail against drug-smuggling at the United
States-Mexico border and against
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/09/02/us/sanctuary-cities.html}{``sanctuary
cities,''} calling for the enactment of legislation that would allow
them to be sued by victims of crimes committed by undocumented
immigrants.

Mr. Trump also invited Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of Kayla
Mueller, who was imprisoned and murdered by the Islamic State. Charles
McGee, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, the first black
fighter pilots, was cheered by the room.

And then there was a made-for-TV moment --- accompanied by chants of
``U.S.A.'' --- when Sgt. First Class Townsend Williams, who is on his
fourth deployment to the Middle East, made a surprise appearance in the
first lady's box, reuniting with his wife and two children.

On the floor, there were themed groups that offered a kind of visual
confrontation to the president. The House Democratic managers in the
impeachment trial, who concluded their arguments on Monday, sat together
behind members of the House leadership. That bloc included
Representatives Adam B. Schiff of California and Jerrold Nadler of New
York.

Lawmakers who didn't attend also drew notice, including a

House Democrats. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of those
lawmakers,
\href{https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1224794863125848065}{said she would
use} Instagram's live video platform to chat with her New York
constituents about Mr. Trump's speech.

After signing an initial trade deal with China last month, Mr. Trump
pointed on Tuesday to the tariffs he has imposed on the country in order
to take on its ``massive theft of America's jobs.'' He said that ``our
strategy has worked.'' Economists, though, say the tariffs
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/fact-check-state-of-the-union-02-04\#i-also-promised-citizens-i-would-impose-tariffs-to-confront-chinas-massive-theft-of-americas-jobs-our-strategy-has-worked}{have
weighed} on the manufacturing sector he set out to help and have led to
higher prices for consumers.

Mr. Trump's attention on foreign policy later swung to the Middle East,
when he highlighted two people his administration killed in recent
months: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, and Maj.
Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian commander.

More conflict, Mr. Trump asserted, would not extend to the war in
Afghanistan, which he said he was eager to wind down by bringing U.S.
troops there home.

``I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in
Afghanistan, many of them innocent,'' he said.

Appealing to his ``America First'' credo, he added that it was ``not our
function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency.''

\subsection{Socialism is threatening Venezuela and the United States,

Attacks on socialism have become regular talking points for Republicans
ahead of the 2020 election, particularly in reference to Senator Bernie
Sanders of Vermont, who is near the top of the polls in the Democratic
primary. Mr. Trump seized on the theme in his speech.

He claimed that 132 lawmakers ``in this room'' have endorsed a
``socialist takeover'' of health care, likely referring to bills that
would create a ``Medicare for all'' system.

``To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never
let socialism destroy American health care,'' he said.

Mr. Trump also went after socialist politics abroad with help from a
notable guest: Juan Guaidó, Venezuela's opposition leader, who received
a standing ovation as Mr. Trump criticized the country's socialist
president, Nicolás Maduro. ``Socialism destroys nations,'' Mr. Trump
said. ``But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.''

\hypertarget{what-impeachment}{%
\subsection{What impeachment?}\label{what-impeachment}}

Mr. Trump never directly addressed impeachment, the story that still
felt inescapable in the House chamber on Tuesday, with Ms. Pelosi, its
initiator, sitting directly behind him. But the tension between the
speaker and the president was palpable throughout the night. As the
president entered the room, he refused to shake the speaker's hand after
she extended hers. By the end, her copy of his speech was in pieces.
