A moment on a sidewalk becomes a koan, a fragment bearing a mysterious
pronoun. Who needs it more: the person who tells it or the person who
receives? Is it gift or intrusion? Repeating in memory the way a
parrot's cackled mantra hovers --- random comments on subways, in
waiting rooms, connect us. And what about this emptiness? Is it empty or
full? \emph{Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye}

By Nick Flynn

 Stranger, uninvited, you\\
come up to us on the sidewalk,

my daughter's hand in mine, you\\
look at her \&

coo, \emph{It goes so fast.} What, stranger,\\
is this unnamed \emph{it} --- this day?

her life? our

happiness? Stranger, maybe you\\
missed it, but just now

my daughter \& I hurled

rocks into the emptiness\\
\& we created more

emptiness.
