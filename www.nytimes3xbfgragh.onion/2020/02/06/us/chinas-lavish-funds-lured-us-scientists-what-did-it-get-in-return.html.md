# China’s Lavish Funds Lured U.S. Scientists. What Did It Get in Return?

</div>

For years, China’s Thousand Talents recruitment plan attracted U.S.
scientists with its grants. Investigators now say China used the program
to steal sensitive technology.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than a decade into his career as an organic chemist, Jon Antilla
found a solution to the grinding task of fund-raising that,
increasingly, was squeezing out his time in the laboratory.

Leaving a tenured position at the University of South Florida, he
relocated to Tianjin University in China, where he was awarded a grant
through a Chinese recruitment program, Thousand Talents.

He wasn’t alone: Colleagues in Tianjin’s chemistry department had given
up tenured positions at the University of California, San Diego, and
Texas A\&M, among other prestigious institutions, attracted by China’s
readily available funding.

“We have time to think here,” Dr. Antilla said. “You can think about
your research.”

As Dr. Antilla proceeded with his academic career, United States
officials changed their view of China’s recruitment programs, which they
say have been used to steal sensitive technology from American
laboratories.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In 2019, the Department of Energy [barred its personnel from
participating in recruitment
programs](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.2.20190620a/full/)
from a handful of countries, including China. A few months later, a
Senate committee declared China’s recruitment programs [a threat to
American
interests](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2019-11-18%20PSI%20Staff%20Report%20-%20China's%20Talent%20Recruitment%20Plans.pdf).

Thousand Talents grantees have become a focus for law enforcement
authorities in the United States, tasked by the Justice Department [with
rooting out scientists who are stealing
research](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/04/health/china-nih-scientists.html)
from American laboratories. Dr. Antilla, like the vast majority of
grantees, is not under suspicion.

Last week, [federal prosecutors charged Charles M.
Lieber](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/28/us/charles-lieber-harvard.html),
an acclaimed Harvard chemist viewed by many as a future Nobel laureate,
with lying to federal authorities about his affiliation with Thousand
Talents.

Andrew E. Lelling, the United States attorney for the District of
Massachusetts, described the program as “a very carefully designed
effort by the Chinese government to fill what it views as its own
strategic gaps,” including nanotechnology, Dr. Lieber’s specialty.

When Dr. Lieber entered into cooperation with Chinese partners, he “was
by definition conveying sensitive information to the Chinese,” Mr.
Lelling said. “The moment he works at Wuhan University of Technology and
conveys it to his Chinese counterparts, that research and expertise is
now at the disposal of the Chinese government, because that’s how it
works in China.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Lieber was charged with one felony count of lying to federal
investigators. He has not entered a plea or responded publicly to the
charge. Peter K. Levitt, Dr. Lieber’s attorney, declined to comment for
this article.

Security analysts are now scrutinizing a range of Chinese talent
programs and the foreign scientists who have applied to them.

“One question would be, is this a bug, or a feature of these programs,
to have a link to espionage?” said Elsa B. Kania, an [adjunct senior
fellow](https://www.cnas.org/people/elsa-b-kania) in the Technology and
National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. She
said she hoped the response by the United States would be “surgical.”

“It is important to course-correct where some of these activities and
behaviors are problematic, or even egregious, without causing collateral
damage to this critical landscape of global research and innovation,”
she said.

A spokeswoman for China’s embassy in Washington, Fang Hong, said the
Thousand Talents program was similar to the recruitment programs of
other countries, intended to promote international cooperation in
science.

“The Chinese government firmly opposes any breach of scientific
integrity and ethics,” Ms. Fang said. Violations uncovered by the United
States government, she said, reflected the actions of individual
scientists, not the Chinese government.

“It is extremely irresponsible and ill intentioned to link individual
behaviors to China’s talent plan,” she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A more emotional response came from Rao Yi, a Chinese neurobiologist
who, after 22 years in the United States, returned to China and said he
was one of the scholars who proposed the Thousand Talents program.

“After decades of brain drains of scientist from China, Chinese economy
can now afford to recruit scientists and support them to carry out basic
science which will be of benefit to mankind,” Dr. Rao, the director of
the Chinese Institute for Brain Research, said in a written response to
questions.

Allegations that the program was used to steal intellectual property
were “a fat lie,” he
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the Thousand Talents recruitment program began in 2008, aiming to
entice Chinese scientists overseas to bring their research back to
China, it hardly raised an eyebrow.

Many scientists were recruited to the talent programs, enticed by
starting salaries that can be as much as three or four times their
existing salaries. More than 10,000 joined, according to William Hannas,
who was a member of the Senior Intelligence Service at the Central
Intelligence Agency.

Dr. Hannas, now lead analyst at the Center for Security and Emerging
Technology at Georgetown University, is the co-author of a forthcoming
book on what he described as China’s “informal” technology transfers.

Not all talent program scientists were at universities. About 300 were
government scientists and about 600 worked for United States
corporations. A quarter were with biotech firms, according to James
Mulvenon, director for intelligence integration at SOS International, a
private defense contractor. He is a Chinese linguist, and the co-author,
with Dr. Hannas, of the book on China’s technology transfers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Until recently, much about the Thousand Talents program was public.

Universities mostly steered clear of investigating researchers, worried
about being accused of racial profiling and threatening academic
freedom, Dr. Mulvenon said.

Even stipulations in some talent program contracts, like ones requiring
that China own intellectual property, did not raise alarms.

In 2018, Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, announced [a “China
initiative”](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/file/1107256/download)
after several cases came to light of scientists illicitly providing
China with technology and research findings paid for by federal
agencies. Its goal was to increase the investigation and prosecution of
Chinese economic espionage-related crimes in the United States. China
soon removed the list of Thousand Talents members from the internet. It
recently changed the program’s name to National High-end Foreign Experts
Recruitment Plan.

There was a complication for the United States investigations, though:
In academia, with its tradition of exchange and openness, researchers
from China were integrated into American labs. Scientists are allowed to
collaborate and give seminars in other countries. Most universities have
loose regulations about outside employment and income. Until very
recently, most federal agencies had no regulations prohibiting employees
from belonging to Chinese talent groups.

Suppose, Dr. Hannas said, a scientist in a university lab or a high-tech
company learned valuable techniques. And suppose that scientist then
signed a contract to work in a Chinese lab on similar technology.

“Is it illegal? Probably not,” he said. “Is it unethical? Hell,
yes.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So far, Dr. Mulvenon said, prosecutors have focused on [discrete
violations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/04/health/china-nih-scientists.html?searchResultPosition=1)
instead of arguing that the programs can be a form of espionage. They
have accused researchers of transgressions such as not revealing large
payments and research funds from China when federal grants require them
to disclose outside funding.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Among the cases brought by federal prosecutors last year was that of You
Xiaorong, a researcher who left a job in Atlanta in which she researched
BPA-free coatings for beverage cans used by the Coca-Cola Company. The
indictment [asserts that Dr.
You](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/one-american-and-one-chinese-national-indicted-tennessee-conspiracy-commit-theft-trade),
who is known as Shannon, was offered a Thousand Talents award “based on
the secrets she stole.” She is alleged to have [transferred trade
secrets worth $120
million](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee/articles/2019-12-23/feds-chemical-engineer-at-center-of-industrial-espionage),
uploading files to her Google drive and taking photographs of industrial
laboratory equipment. **** Ms. You has pleaded not guilty.

Many investigations of academics are still in progress, but some
accusations have been made public. Officials at M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston and at the National Institutes of Health, for example,
found emails and documents that they say revealed [flagrant
violations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/04/health/china-nih-scientists.html?searchResultPosition=2)
by some academic scientists, such as grant reviewers who sent
confidential grant proposals detailing research plans to colleagues in
China. In other cases, the N.I.H. said, researchers were getting patents
[or starting companies in
China](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/couple-who-worked-local-research-institute-10-years-charged-stealing-trade-secrets-wire-fraud)
based on research carried out at a United States university with support
from the federal government.

Dr. Mulvenon said explicit transgressions are thought to be only a part
of the problem of keeping valuable United States technology safe.

It is, he said, a gray area. “It’s not a case of them stealing
technology by infiltrating a computer,” he said “What we are seeing is
them relieving the rest of the world of technology by means that are not
necessarily illegal.”

He added, “We can’t say, ‘We don’t want to do research with the
Chinese.’”

Peter Zeidenberg, a lawyer who is representing two dozen Chinese and
Chinese-American scientists who are under investigation, noted that
prosecutors in most of the cases have not alleged any technology
transfers, and were focused instead on the scientists’ failure to
disclose grants.

“They’re taking an unbelievably heavy-handed approach to this,” said Mr.
Zeidenberg, a partner in the Washington, D.C., firm Arent Fox. “There is
no compliance training on these forms. It’s just a form you get every
year. Until very recently, nobody paid any attention this stuff. Now
they’re cracking the whip and they’re treating these people like
felons.”

Scores of Western scientists have applied for Thousand Talents grants
over the years. In interviews, several described their decision as
straightforward: China had money available.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“When you get above a postdoc level, everybody applies to every country
in the world,” said Tim Byrnes, an [assistant professor of
physics](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/tim-byrnes)
at N.Y.U.’s campus in Shanghai, who received a Thousand Talents grant in
2016. “People are crossing borders all the time, and eventually
congregate where there is the most money. China is now pouring huge
amounts of money for research.”

Like the other grantees who were interviewed, Dr. Byrnes said he had
never had to submit any reports on his research to the Chinese
government, and that all his research is published in academic journals.
He said Thousand Talents was similar to other international grant
programs.

“It’s only because it’s from China that everybody has this kind of
opinion of it,” he said.

Already, he said, any affiliation with the program is damaging the
prospects of scientists seeking funding from the United States
government. “If I write this information down, immediately the
probability of the success of this or that grant sort of plummets,” he
said.

Dr. Antilla, the organic chemist who relocated to Tianjin, said there
were indeed ethical minefields for recipients holding positions in China
and the United States, and that he eventually decided to move his work
entirely to China to avoid them.

Particularly thorny, he said, is the practice of maintaining
laboratories in both China and the United States.

“There are questions about intellectual property — how do you share
data, if you share it at all,” said Mr. Antilla, now a professor of
chemistry at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University. “It could be tricky. What are
the rules?”

But he said he was always scrupulous about reporting the money he
received to his employers in the United States. It worried him, he said,
that Thousand Talents was “getting a bad name.”

“Basically, I think my science is for the world,” he said. “There’s
nothing that China is getting from my science that they’re keeping from
the world. I publish everything I get.”
