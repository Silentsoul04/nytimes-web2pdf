WUHAN, China —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>He was the
doctor who tried to sound a warning that a troubling cluster of viral
infections in a Chinese province could grow out of control — and was
then summoned for a middle-of-the-night reprimand over his candor.

On Friday, the doctor, [Li
Wenliang](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/07/world/asia/Li-Wenliang-china-coronavirus.html),
died after contracting the very illness he had told medical school
classmates about in an online chat room, the coronavirus. He joined the
more than 600 other Chinese who have died in an outbreak that has now
spread across the globe.

Dr. Li “had the misfortune to be infected during the fight against the
novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, and all-out efforts to save him
failed,” the Wuhan City Central Hospital [said on
Weibo](https://www.weibo.com/whzxyy?is_hot=1), the Chinese social media
service. “We express our deep regret and condolences.”

Even before his death, Dr. Li had become a hero to many Chinese after
word of his treatment at the hands of the authorities emerged. In early
January, he was called in by both medical officials and the police, and
forced to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and
illegal rumor.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Word of his death unleashed an even greater upsurge of emotion.

“We will not forget the doctor who spoke up about an illness that was
called rumor,” one commenter posted in reply to the hospital’s
announcement. “What else can we do? The only thing is not to forget.”

But in recent weeks, he became a potent icon for Chinese people angry
that a viral outbreak had swelled unchecked into a full-blown crisis,
and that the doctor who had spoken out was initially punished.

His death poses a singularly delicate issue for the Chinese government.
Even as officials have battled the epidemic, they have also tried to
stifle widespread criticism that they mismanaged their response to the
initial outbreak in Wuhan, a city of 11 million.

In recent days, China [stepped up
censorship](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/world/asia/china-coronavirus-censorship.html)
after a rush of online criticism and investigative reports by emboldened
Chinese journalists exposed missteps by officials who underestimated and
underplayed the threat of the coronavirus.

Dr. Li’s death has also exposed a troubling aspect of the epidemic that
goes unmentioned in official statistics: the number of doctors, nurses
and medical workers infected by the virus.

Some unverified pictures of what appear to be government data have
indicated that hundreds of hospital workers may have been infected in
Wuhan. Earlier in the outbreak, a prominent infectious disease expert
said that a single patient had infected 14 medical workers at one
hospital.

Dr. Li was also unusually young to be afflicted by the virus, at least
according to the data gathered so far.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>The median of patients is between 49 and 56, researchers
say.

When Dr. Li posted his chat room warning on Dec. 30, the new coronavirus
had not yet been identified. He said it resembled Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, an earlier coronavirus that ravaged China
nearly two decades ago.

Not long after his reprimand, Dr. Li was vindicated as thousands of

their number after contracting the virus from a patient he was treating
for glaucoma.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Dr. Li’s death came after a night of speculation about his fate,
including an online outpouring of grief in China prompted by premature
reports that he had died. Just hours before confirming that he had died,
the hospital [said on
Weibo](https://passport.weibo.com/visitor/visitor?entry=miniblog&a=enter&url=https%3A%2F%2Fweibo.com%2F2630028693%2FIt0oliY8J%3Ffrom%3Dpage_1001062630028693_profile%26wvr%3D6%26mod%3Dweibotime&domain=.weibo.com&ua=php-sso_sdk_client-0.6.28&_rand=1581029359.874)
that it was still fighting to save him.

“Not sleeping\!\!\! Waiting online for a miracle,” said one commenter
under the hospital’s statement on Weibo. “We don’t need to sleep
tonight, but Li Wenliang must rise.”

When the announcement came that he had died, many comments accused the
authorities of having sought to prolong Dr. Li’s life until deep into
the
night.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Soon after Dr. Li’s death was announced, the Hubei Province Health
Commission issued a brief message offering condolences, and [so did the
health
authorities](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020020709438)
of the city of Wuhan. Global Times, a reliably pro-government tabloid,
also mourned the death, while also urging readers to support the
government’s fight against the epidemic.

“That Li Wenliang could not escape having his life snatched away shows
that this is an arduous and complex battle,” an [online
article](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1657823085627418251&wfr=spider&for=pc)
in Global Times said. “At this critical juncture, all of us must be
united.”

The New York Times [wrote about Dr.
Li](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
this month, in an article detailing the government’s many missteps in
handling the crisis.

“If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier,”
Dr. Li told The Times. “I think it would have been a lot better. There
should be more openness and transparency.”

Dr. Li’s death appeared unlikely to inspire protests in Wuhan, which has
been under lockdown for just over two weeks in an unprecedented effort
to extinguish the epidemic. In Wuhan and other heavily restricted areas
of Hubei, residents mostly stay inside their homes and avoid socializing
for fear of catching the virus.

Much of the rest of China is also under tight restrictions that make
mass displays of mourning unlikely.

Dr. Li continued to speak out during his own illness.

“I think a healthy society should not have just one voice,” he [recently
told Caixin](http://china.caixin.com/2020-02-06/101509761.html), a
Chinese magazine that has reported aggressively on the epidemic.

And, at least recently, Dr. Li sounded hopeful about overcoming the
illness and going back to work.

“After I recover, I still want to return to the front line,” he [told
The Southern Metropolis
Daily](http://m.mp.oeeee.com/a/BAAFRD000020200206259581.html), a Chinese
newspaper. “The epidemic is still spreading, and I don’t want to be a
deserter.”

Reporting was contributed by Li Yuan and Cao Li in Hong Kong, and Vivian
Wang in New York. Research was contributed by Elsie Chen in Wuhan, and
Claire Fu, Wang Yiwei and Amber Wang in Beijing.
