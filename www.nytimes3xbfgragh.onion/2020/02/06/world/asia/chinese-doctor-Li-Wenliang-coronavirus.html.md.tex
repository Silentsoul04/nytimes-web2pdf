Dr. Li Wenliang issued a warning about a strange new virus. Then the
authorities summoned him for questioning.

WUHAN, China --- He was the doctor who tried to sound a warning that a
troubling cluster of viral infections in a Chinese province could grow
out of control --- and was then summoned for a middle-of-the-night
reprimand over his candor.

On Friday, the doctor,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/07/world/asia/Li-Wenliang-china-coronavirus.html}{Li
Wenliang}, died after contracting the very illness he had told medical
school classmates about in an online chat room, the coronavirus. He
joined the more than 600 other Chinese who have died in an outbreak that
has now spread across the globe.

Dr. Li ``had the misfortune to be infected during the fight against the
novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, and all-out efforts to save him
failed,'' the Wuhan City Central Hospital
\href{https://www.weibo.com/whzxyy?is_hot=1}{said on Weibo}, the Chinese
social media service. ``We express our deep regret and condolences.''

Even before his death, Dr. Li had become a hero to many Chinese after
word of his treatment at the hands of the authorities emerged. In early
January, he was called in by both medical officials and the police, and
forced to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and
illegal rumor.

Word of his death unleashed an even greater upsurge of emotion.

``We will not forget the doctor who spoke up about an illness that was
called rumor,'' one commenter posted in reply to the hospital's
announcement. ``What else can we do? The only thing is not to forget.''

Dr. Li, who was 34 and expecting a second child with his wife, had been
a relatively obscure ophthalmologist in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei
Province and the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic.

But in recent weeks, he became a potent icon for Chinese people angry
that a viral outbreak had swelled unchecked into a full-blown crisis,
and that the doctor who had spoken out was initially punished.

His death poses a singularly delicate issue for the Chinese government.
Even as officials have battled the epidemic, they have also tried to
stifle widespread criticism that they mismanaged their response to the
initial outbreak in Wuhan, a city of 11 million.

In recent days, China
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/05/world/asia/china-coronavirus-censorship.html}{stepped
up censorship} after a rush of online criticism and investigative
reports by emboldened Chinese journalists exposed missteps by officials
who underestimated and underplayed the threat of the coronavirus.

Dr. Li's death has also exposed a troubling aspect of the epidemic that
goes unmentioned in official statistics: the number of doctors, nurses
and medical workers infected by the virus.

Some unverified pictures of what appear to be government data have
indicated that hundreds of hospital workers may have been infected in
Wuhan. Earlier in the outbreak, a prominent infectious disease expert
said that a single patient had infected 14 medical workers at one
hospital.

Dr. Li was also unusually young to be afflicted by the virus, at least
according to the data gathered so far. The median of patients is between
49 and 56, researchers say.

When Dr. Li posted his chat room warning on Dec. 30, the new coronavirus
had not yet been identified. He said it resembled Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, an earlier coronavirus that ravaged China
nearly two decades ago.

Not long after his reprimand, Dr. Li was vindicated as thousands of
Wuhan residents fell ill with fever and pneumonia symptoms. He joined
their number after contracting the virus from a patient he was treating
for glaucoma.

Dr. Li's death came after a night of speculation about his fate,
including an online outpouring of grief in China prompted by premature
reports that he had died. Just hours before confirming that he had died,
the hospital
\href{https://passport.weibo.com/visitor/visitor?entry=miniblog\&a=enter\&url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fweibo.com\%2F2630028693\%2FIt0oliY8J\%3Ffrom\%3Dpage_1001062630028693_profile\%26wvr\%3D6\%26mod\%3Dweibotime\&domain=.weibo.com\&ua=php-sso_sdk_client-0.6.28\&_rand=1581029359.874}{said
on Weibo} that it was still fighting to save him.

``Not sleeping!!! Waiting online for a miracle,'' said one commenter
under the hospital's statement on Weibo. ``We don't need to sleep
tonight, but Li Wenliang must rise.''

When the announcement came that he had died, many comments accused the
authorities of having sought to prolong Dr. Li's life until deep into
the night.

    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

Soon after Dr. Li's death was announced, the Hubei Province Health
Commission issued a brief message offering condolences, and
\href{http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020020709438}{so did
the health authorities} of the city of Wuhan. Global Times, a reliably
pro-government tabloid, also mourned the death, while also urging
readers to support the government's fight against the epidemic.

``That Li Wenliang could not escape having his life snatched away shows
that this is an arduous and complex battle,'' an
\href{https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1657823085627418251\&wfr=spider\&for=pc}{online
article} in Global Times said. ``At this critical juncture, all of us
must be united.''

The New York Times
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html}{wrote
about Dr. Li} this month, in an article detailing the government's many
missteps in handling the crisis.

``If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic
earlier,'' Dr. Li told The Times. ``I think it would have been a lot
better. There should be more openness and transparency.''

Dr. Li's death appeared unlikely to inspire protests in Wuhan, which has
been under lockdown for just over two weeks in an unprecedented effort
to extinguish the epidemic. In Wuhan and other heavily restricted areas
of Hubei, residents mostly stay inside their homes and avoid socializing
for fear of catching the virus.

Much of the rest of China is also under tight restrictions that make
mass displays of mourning unlikely.

Dr. Li continued to speak out during his own illness.

``I think a healthy society should not have just one voice,'' he
\href{http://china.caixin.com/2020-02-06/101509761.html}{recently told
Caixin}, a Chinese magazine that has reported aggressively on the
epidemic.

And, at least recently, Dr. Li sounded hopeful about overcoming the
illness and going back to work.

``After I recover, I still want to return to the front line,'' he
\href{http://m.mp.oeeee.com/a/BAAFRD000020200206259581.html}{told The
Southern Metropolis Daily}, a Chinese newspaper. ``The epidemic is still
spreading, and I don't want to be a deserter.''

Reporting was contributed by Li Yuan and Cao Li in Hong Kong, and Vivian
Wang in New York. Research was contributed by Elsie Chen in Wuhan, and
Claire Fu, Wang Yiwei and Amber Wang in Beijing.
