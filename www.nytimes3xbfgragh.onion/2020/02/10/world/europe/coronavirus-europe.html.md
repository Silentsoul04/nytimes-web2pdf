LONDON — Britain’s health department declared the new coronavirus an
[“imminent
threat”](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-makes-new-regulations-on-coronavirus)
to public health and announced a series of measures to combat the spread
of the virus, a sign of the seriousness with which local health
authorities are treating the fears of the epidemic.

The newly introduced measures — which apply only in England — are among
the first in Europe to allow the health authorities to keep individuals
in quarantine if public health professionals believe they may be at risk
of spreading the virus.

Four more people in Britain linked to a cluster of transmissions at a
ski resort in France tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the
total number of cases in the country to eight, the health department
announced Monday.

The coronavirus [has sickened more than 40,500
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps.html),
mostly in China, and at least 910 people have died since the virus first
emerged in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in the central part of the
country late last year. Since that time, the virus has also spread to
[at least 24
countries](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/13/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html),
[triggering fears of a global
pandemic.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/02/health/coronavirus-pandemic-china.html)

The Department of Health and Social Care emphasized that the risk of
contracting the coronavirus in Britain remained “moderate,” even as the
government empowered the health authorities to forcibly quarantine
people. It also designated a hospital, near Liverpool, and a conference
center, northwest of London, as isolation facilities for those placed
under quarantine.

“I will do everything in my power to keep people in this country safe,”
Matt Hancock, Britain’s health secretary, [said in a
statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-secretary-announces-strengthened-legal-powers-to-bolster-public-health-protections-against-coronavirus).
“We are taking every possible step to control the outbreak of
coronavirus.”

He added that it meant health care providers would be “supported with
additional legal powers to keep people safe across the country,” noting
transmission of the coronavirus would “constitute a serious threat.”

The new measures were announced a day after a repatriation flight from
Hubei Province — Wuhan is the largest city in the area — carrying about
200 citizens from Britain and elsewhere landed at an air force base in
central England. British passengers were taken to the Kents Hill Park
conference center, about 50 miles northwest of London, for 14 days of
quarantine.

“The new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed U.K.
case, and the virus was passed on in France,” Professor Whitty said in a
statement. “Experts at Public Health England continue to work hard
tracing patient contacts from the U.K. cases. They successfully
identified these individuals and ensured the appropriate support was
provided.”

The new cases in Britain are linked to cases in France, according to the
French health authorities which all [trace back to a group of British
citizens staying in a chalet](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7rnsoh)
in the Alpine village of Les Contamines-Montjoie, near Switzerland, late
last month.

A British man at the center of the transmissions is believed to have
contracted the coronavirus while attending a conference in Singapore,
before flying<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>to Geneva on Jan.
24, and from there<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the village,
where he shared lodgings with a group of fellow Britons.

The man then returned to Britain on Jan. 28 on an easyJet flight, the
budget airline confirmed in an emailed statement. He is among the eight
people in Britain who have tested positive for the virus.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

EasyJet said in an emailed statement that it had been notified by the
public health authorities that a customer who had recently traveled on
flight EZS8481 from Geneva to London Gatwick on Jan. 28 had since
received a coronavirus diagnosis.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Public Health England is contacting all passengers who were seated in
the vicinity of the customer,” the company said in a statement, but
noted that since the man had not been experiencing any symptoms, the
risk to others on board the flight was “very low.”

At least one of the people who tested positive for the virus was
confirmed to be from Brighton, a seaside town on England’s south coast,
and the BBC reported on Monday that the County Oak medical center there
had to shut its doors after [a member of staff tested positive for the
virus](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51447761).

A message on the center’s answering machine indicated it had been closed
for an “urgent operational health and safety
reason.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Public Health England confirmed that two of the cases of coronavirus in
Britain were health care workers. Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England’s
medical director, said in a statement that all of the new cases
announced on Monday were “closely linked to one another.”

“Our priority has been to speak to those who have close and sustained
contact with confirmed cases, so we can advise them on what they can do
to limit the spread of the virus,” she said. “We are now working
urgently to identify all patients and other health care workers who may
have come into close contact, and at this stage we believe this to be a
relatively small
number.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe

At least [five other Britons who stayed in the chalet and are still in
France have tested positive for the
coronavirus](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7rmoy6), said Agnès
Buzyn, France’s health minister. They are among at least 11 people in
France who have tested positive for the disease.

A 9-year-old boy was among the British people who contracted the virus
in the ski village. According to a spokeswoman for the region, the child
is a permanent resident of the village, where he lives with his father,
who also contracted the virus, and two siblings. His mother is currently
in Britain.

He attended a local school in Les Contamines-Montjoie and took French
lessons in two nearby schools in Saint-Gervais and Thonon-Les-Bains. As
a precaution, the three schools have all been closed for the week and
fellow students are being tested.

Six other British people staying in the chalet have all tested negative
for the virus, according to the head of France’s national health agency,
Jérome Salomon.

The French health authorities said they were still in the process of
determining exactly how many people were staying in the chalet and who
may have come into contact with those carrying the coronavirus.

Ms. Buzyn, the health minister, visited the ski resort on Sunday.

“It is important to reassure the people of this village,” she said. “We
have to tell them that there is no risk when you meet people on the
street, it’s not the same as being in contact with an infected person.”

“It’s about close, sustained, face-to-face or physical contact,” she
added.

A crisis unit has been opened in Les Contamines-Montjoie, where testing
is underway to determine if there are further cases of the coronavirus.

On Sunday night, Mr. Salomon, the head of the national health agency,
announced that results from 21 samples had all tested negative and that
25 others were still being analyzed.

“It’s already very good news,” he said.

Etienne Jacquet, the mayor of Les Contamines-Montjoie, said in a phone
interview that students who might have been in contact with the infected
child underwent tests as a priority on Sunday. He said the precautionary
measures made the village, in his opinion, the “most secure city in
France” when it came to the coronavirus.

“In Les Contamines-Montjoie life goes on normally,” Mr. Jacquet said.
“For the moment there is absolutely no crisis.”
