We’ve come a long way from the cans of Folgers that filled our
grandparents’ cupboards, with our oat milk lattes, cold brews and
Frappuccinos. Some of us are still very utilitarian about the drink
while others perform elaborate rituals. The fourth most popular beverage
in the country, coffee is steeped into our culture. Just the right
amount can improve our mood; too much may make us feel anxious and
jittery.

## Is coffee good for me?

Yes.

In moderation, coffee seems to be good for most people — that’s 3 to 5
cups daily, or up to 400 milligrams of caffeine.

“The evidence is pretty consistent that coffee is associated with a
lower risk of mortality,” said Erikka Loftfield, a research fellow at
the National Cancer Institute who has studied the beverage.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For years, coffee was believed to be a possible carcinogen, but the 2015
[Dietary
Guidelines](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/PDFs/Scientific-Report-of-the-2015-Dietary-Guidelines-Advisory-Committee.pdf)
**** helped to change perception. **** For the first time, moderate
coffee drinking was included as part of a healthy diet. When researchers
controlled for lifestyle factors, like how **** many heavy coffee
drinkers also smoked, the data tipped in coffee’s favor.

A large 2017 review on coffee consumption and human health **** in the
[British Medical
Journal](https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5024.long) also found ****
that most of the time, coffee was associated with a benefit, rather than
a harm. In examining more than 200 reviews of previous studies, the
authors observed that moderate coffee drinkers had less cardiovascular
disease, and premature death from all causes, including heart attacks
and stroke, than those skipping the beverage.

In addition, experts say some of **** the strongest protective effects
may be with Type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and liver conditions
such as cirrhosis, liver cancer and chronic liver disease. For example,
having about five cups of coffee a day, instead of none, is correlated
with a 30 percent decreased risk of Type 2 diabetes, according to a
meta-analysis of 30 studies.

The potential benefit from coffee might be from the polyphenols, which
are plant compounds that have antioxidant properties, according to Dr.
Giuseppe Grosso, an assistant professor in human nutrition at University
of Catania in Italy and the lead author of an **** [umbrella
review](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-nutr-071816-064941)
**** in the Annual Review of Nutrition.

However, coffee isn’t for everyone. There are concerns about
overconsumption. This is especially true for expecting mothers because
the safety of caffeine during pregnancy is unclear. While the research
into coffee’s impact on health is ongoing, most of the work in this
field is observational.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We don’t know for sure if coffee is the cause of the health benefits,”
said Jonathan Fallowfield, a professor at the University of Edinburgh,
and co-author of the British Medical Journal review. **“**These findings
could be due to other factors or behaviors present in coffee drinkers.”

-----

## Does the way coffee is prepared matter?

Yes. Do you prefer a dark or light roast? Coarse grinding or fine?
Arabica or robusta?

“All of these different aspects affect the taste, but also affect the
compounds within the coffees,” said Neal Freedman, a senior investigator
with the National Cancer Institute. “But it’s not clear at all how these
different levels of compounds may be related to health.”

Roasting, for example, reduces the amount of chlorogenic acids, but
other antioxidant compounds are formed. Espresso has the highest
concentration of many compounds because it has less water than drip
coffee.

A
[study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2686145)
in JAMA Internal Medicine examined the coffee habits of nearly 500,000
people in the U.K. and found that it didn’t matter if they drank one cup
or chain-drank eight — regular or decaf — or whether they were fast
metabolizers of coffee or slow. They were linked to a lower risk of
death from all causes, except with instant coffee, the evidence was
weaker.

The way you prepare your cup of joe may influence your cholesterol
levels, too. “The one coffee we know not suitable to be drinking is the
boiled coffee,” said Marilyn C. Cornelis, an assistant professor in
preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of
Medicine and co-author of the JAMA Internal Medicine study.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Examples of this include the plunge-happy French press, Scandinavian
coffee, or Greek and Turkish coffee — the kind commonly consumed in the
Middle East. (When poured, the unfiltered grounds settle on the tiny
cup’s bottom like sludge. To peek into the future, elders in the
region have a tradition of reading the sediment of an overturned cup,
like a crystal ball.)

However, the oil in [boiled
coffee](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915097000993)
has cafestol and kahweol, compounds called diterpenes. They are shown to
raise LDL, the bad cholesterol, and slightly lower HDL, what’s known as
the good kind.

“If you filter the coffee, then it’s no issue at all,” said Rob van Dam,
a professor at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at National
University of Singapore. “For people with cholesterol issues, it’s
better to switch to other types of coffee.” He’s been studying coffee
for two decades. (And, yes, he’s had a lot of coffee in that time.)

However, other researchers say not to throw out the boiled coffee just
yet. The clinical significance of such small increases in cholesterol
may be questionable, given that it’s not associated with an increase in
cardiovascular deaths.

Many consumers have also swapped loose grounds for coffee pods. While
there are environmental concerns with single use pods, researchers
believe them to hold the same benefits as, say, drip coffee. The latter
applies to cold brew, too, but more research is
needed.

## Do all kinds of coffee have the same amount of caffeine?

No. Espresso has the highest concentration of caffeine, packing about 70
milligrams into a one-ounce shot, but is consumed in smaller quantities.
By comparison, a typical 12-ounce serving of drip coffee has 200
milligrams of caffeine, more than instant’s 140. And, yes, brewed decaf
has caffeine, too — 8 milligrams — which can add up.

When buying coffee, you never really know what you’re going to get. At
one Florida coffee house, over a six-day period, the same 16-ounce
[breakfast blend](https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/27/7/520/784168)
fluctuated from 259 milligrams all the way up to 564 — which goes beyond
federal recommendations.

But for some of us, knowing how much caffeine is in our coffee can be
especially important. You’ve probably noticed it before. How a friend
can pound quadruple espresso shots at 10 p.m. and sleep afterward, while
you can’t have any past noon, or you’ll be watching “Seinfeld” reruns
until dawn. Some of us have a polymorphism, a genetic variant that slows
our metabolism for caffeine. It’s these individuals that Dr. Grosso
recommends limit their refills. “They take a coffee, and then they have
the second and the third, and they still have the caffeine of the
first,” he said.

You can even [find out whether you are a fast or slow
metabolizer](https://well.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/07/12/for-coffee-drinkers-the-buzz-may-be-in-your-genes/)
through a variety of direct-to-consumer testing services, including
23andMe.

## Is coffee addictive?

Evidence suggests there can be a reliance on the drink, and tolerance
builds over time. Withdrawal symptoms include a headache, fatigue,
irritability, difficulty concentrating, and depressed mood.

Indeed, caffeine is a psychoactive drug, and coffee is its biggest
dietary source. About a half-hour after sipping a cup of joe, the
caffeine kicks in, and is quickly absorbed. Blood vessels constrict.
Blood pressure increases. A moderate amount of caffeine can wake you up,
boost your mood, energy, alertness, concentration and even athletic
performance. On average, it takes four to six hours to metabolize half
the caffeine.

For those knocking back more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day,
there’s not enough evidence to assess the safety, according to the
Dietary Guidelines. [Higher
doses](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/caff.2019.0020) can lead
to caffeine intoxication, with its shakiness, nervousness, and irregular
heartbeat. Caffeine is also
[linked](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079216000150?via%3Dihub)
with delaying the time it takes for you fall asleep, how long you stay
there, and the reported quality of that shut eye.

“I think that caffeine is so common and so ingrained in our culture, and
daily habits, that we often don’t think about it as a potential source
of problems,” said Mary M. Sweeney, an assistant professor of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine.

Cutting down coffee may help with gastroesophageal reflux, too. A [new
study](https://cghjournal.org/retrieve/pii/S1542356519313801) found that
women drinking caffeinated beverages — coffee, tea, or soda — were
associated with a small but increased risk of symptoms, like heartburn.
The study’s authors predicted fewer symptoms when substituting two
servings of the drinks with water.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Current available research hasn’t determined what amount of caffeine can
be safely consumed during pregnancy, according to the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Caffeine does cross the placenta so
some doctors may recommend pregnant women stay below 200 milligrams of
coffee daily.

Extremely high doses of caffeine can be
[fatal.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6011436/) But
researchers say that’s more likely to occur accidentally with caffeine
powder or pills. “You don’t see a lot of people going into the emergency
room because they accidentally drank too much coffee,” said Dr. van Dam.

## What is a coffee bean?

Inside the red fruit of *coffea* lie two coffee beans. Green in color,
the duo spoon together, the rich brown hue to appear only after
roasting. In fact, they aren’t beans at all. “It’s like a cherry, you
pick off the tree,” said Patrick Brown, a professor of plant sciences at
University of California, Davis. Unlike the cherry, though, the seed is
the prize, and the flesh is discarded.

In addition to caffeine, coffee is a dark brew of a thousand chemical
compounds that could have potential therapeutic effects on the body. One
key component, chlorogenic acid, is a polyphenol found in many fruits
and vegetables. Coffee is also a good dietary source of vitamin B3,
magnesium and potassium.

“People often see coffee just as a vehicle for caffeine, but, of course,
it’s a very complex plant beverage,” said Dr. van Dam.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With *coffea’s* estimated 124 species, most of flavors remain untapped;
and perhaps will be forever, with an estimated 60 percent under threat
of extinction, largely from climate change, disease, pests and
deforestation. What fills our mugs at cafes, the office, and on road
trips are from two species: arabica and canephora, known as robusta.
Arabica fills specialty cafes, and costs more than robusta, which fuels
instant coffees and some espressos.

For all of the pomp swirling around arabica, the fact remains it is an
extremely homogeneous little seed. Almost all of the world’s arabica
coffee progeny traces itself back a few plants from Ethiopia, coffee’s
birthplace, or Yemen.

-----

## Does adding milk or sugar cancel out benefits?

Doctors don’t know. One 2015
[study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5875735/) found
that those adding sugar, cream or milk had the same associated benefit
as those who preferred it black. But the coffee industry has exploded
since the ’90s when the older adults in the study filled out their
dietary history. “It was only about a tablespoon of cream or milk, and a
teaspoon of sugar,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Loftfield, with
the National Cancer Institute. “This is very different, potentially,
than some of these coffee beverages you see on the market today.”

Sweet coffee and tea are the fourth largest source of sugar in the diets
of adults, according to the October survey from the U.S.D.A. That
includes dessert-like beverages, like Dunkin’ Donuts’ 860-calorie creamy
frozen coconut caramel coffee drink, with 17 grams of saturated fat, and
129 grams of total sugars. Experts say some of these drinks bear little
relation to the 2-calorie cup of black
[coffee](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#_blank) of the past,
worrying health officials.

“When you talk about a drink that has that load of unhealthy fats and
that much sugar, can’t possibly be a healthy beverage on balance,” Dr.
Jim Krieger, a clinical professor of medicine and health services at the
University of Washington. “That amount of sugar alone is astronomical
compared to the current recommendations of U.S. Dietary Guidelines of 50
grams of sugar a day.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The concern is heightened, experts say, especially because an estimated
43 percent of teens are now drinking coffee — nearly doubling since 2003
— according to the research firm Kantar, driven partly by sweet drinks.

“People should worry a lot about what they put in the coffee and what
the food and beverage industry puts in it,” said Laura Schmidt, a
professor at the University of California San Francisco School of
Medicine. “And sweetened coffee is one of the things that the beverage
industry is pushing on the public now that consumers have turned away
from soda for health reasons.”

-----

## Should I start pounding down more coffee?

Depends on your goals in life.

If you are enjoying the drink in moderation, doctors say continue
onward, and savor those sips. And for those patients with a sensitivity
to the beverage, Dr. Sophie Balzora, a gastroenterologist, weighs the
benefits and risks very carefully. The clinical associate professor of
medicine at N.Y.U. School of Medicine understands its cultural
significance, and knows to tread lightly. As she put it: “Robbing people
of their coffee seems
cruel.”
