Sharply}\label{how-the-coronavirus-numbers-changed-so-sharply}}

A new way of counting used by the Chinese authorities should catch more
cases and get people into treatment earlier. But the scale of the
epidemic will remain unclear for some time.

The number of cases and deaths in the coronavirus epidemic in China
jumped sharply on Thursday as the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-cases-china.html}{authorities
there changed how they keep track} of the disease, and not, primarily,
because of any change in the shape of the outbreak.

There is still a lot of uncertainty about the true numbers --- as with
any new disease --- and that will continue for the foreseeable future.
Underscoring that point, hours after China revised its figures, the
World Health Organization put out a lower set, saying that for now, it
would not change the way it counts.

But experts say there were good reasons for changing the way patients
with the disease, newly named Covid-19, were counted, and the new
approach should catch many cases that had been missed before. That will
allow more patients to get treatment and be quarantined faster.

Here is a look at what we know --- and what we don't --- about the new
coronavirus numbers and what they say about the scope of the crisis.

For several days, the Chinese government had reported figures that
suggested the spread of the disease was slowing, but that changed
abruptly on Thursday.

The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number
of other countries.

Officials in Hubei, the Chinese province that is the epicenter of the
outbreak, said there had been more than 48,000 cases there, a 44 percent
jump from the day before. They also reported 1,310 deaths, a 23 percent
increase. The trend continued on Friday, though not as markedly, when
Hubei officials disclosed another 4,800 cases and 116 more deaths.

Previously, cases were counted only if patients tested positive for the
new virus. Now, the figures appear to include anyone who has a CT scan
of the lungs showing a telltale pattern of pneumonia.

In the short run, the new accounting may deepen confusion about the true
size of the epidemic. It also complicates efforts to track the growth of
the disease over the last several weeks.

``We need to be careful in interpreting these numbers,'' Dr. Michael
Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergency responses chief, said on
Thursday. The larger number of cases, he said, ``does not represent a
significant
\href{https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200213-sitrep-24-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=9a7406a4_2}{change
in the trajectory of the outbreak.''}

The W.H.O. then
\href{https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200213-sitrep-24-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=9a7406a4_2}{released
its own figures}, leaving out the diagnoses made without a positive test
for the virus --- and indicating that it did not fully understand the
change China had made.

``For consistency, we report here only the number of
laboratory-confirmed cases,'' the organization said in a situation
report. ``W.H.O. has formally requested additional information on the
clinically diagnosed cases, in particular when these have occurred in
the course of the outbreak and whether suspect cases were reclassified
as clinically diagnosed cases.''

The W.H.O. reported almost 47,000 confirmed cases worldwide, fewer than
1 percent outside mainland China. The Chinese figures put the total at
more than 61,000 cases.

\subsection{What was wrong with the old way of
counting?}\label{what-was-wrong-with-the-old-way-of-counting}}

In a word, plenty.

Kits to test for the virus are not being produced quickly enough to keep
up with demand, and they take days to produce results. Using CT scans
means more patients can be checked, with the results available almost
immediately.

And the tests for the virus have not been very reliable. Many sick
people have tested negative, only to test positive later. That appears
to be, at least in part, because standard testing involves swabbing
nasal passages and the throat, while the virus may be lodged in the
lungs.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
shipped hundreds of testing kits to state laboratories ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html}{and
days later revealed that some of them were faulty}. It is not clear
whether China has experienced similar problems in making the tests.

\hypertarget{so-are-the-new-numbers-definitive}{%
\subsection{So are the new numbers
definitive?}\label{so-are-the-new-numbers-definitive}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/02/13/world/13coronavirus-explainer-sub/merlin_168875646_f9a45086-045a-48c8-91e4-0f284fe22757-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

No.

There are several ways cases might still be missed. Some people get
sick, and die or recover, without ever seeing a doctor. CT scans allow
doctors to identify people whose infections have caused pneumonia, which
can be fatal, but the scans will not catch people with milder symptoms.

There is another source of confusion about the numbers. It was reported
this week that China is no longer counting as confirmed cases people who
test positive for the virus yet show no symptoms. But some experts said
they were not sure what had actually changed.

The Chinese health authorities say they can distinguish, on a CT scan,
pneumonia brought on by the coronavirus from some other serious lung
diseases. But it is not clear that they can tell it from pneumonia
caused by other diseases, like seasonal influenza; the accuracy may vary
with the skill of the doctor reading the scan.

\hypertarget{will-we-eventually-get-more-accurate-figures}{%
\subsection{Will we eventually get more accurate
figures?}\label{will-we-eventually-get-more-accurate-figures}}

Quite possibly.

Right now, labs are testing for the virus itself, and viruses can be
hard to detect. What is often easier to identify is the immune system's
own response.

When a patient contracts an infection, the body produces antibodies to
it --- proteins in the blood that recognize a particular pathogen and
trigger an immune system attack on it. Labs around the world are working
to develop a test for antibodies to the new coronavirus, but none is
available yet.

It could be tricky.

There are several strains of coronavirus in humans, including ones that
cause common colds, SARS and MERS. Antibodies to the new virus may be
hard to distinguish from the antibodies people already have to other
coronaviruses.

In any case, it can take days or weeks before a patient tests positive
for antibodies to a new infection, so the test may not be useful in
diagnosing current illnesses.

So while an effective antibody test may produce a fairly comprehensive
picture of an outbreak, that picture will lag a bit behind the reality.
