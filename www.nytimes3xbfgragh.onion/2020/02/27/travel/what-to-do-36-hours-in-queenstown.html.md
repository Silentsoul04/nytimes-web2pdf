# 36 Hours in Queenstown, New Zealand

</div>

The adventure capital is a gateway to countless thrills, but after all
the hiking and bungee jumping, the town offers a few adventures of its
own.

The adventure capital of New Zealand, Queenstown, the South Island’s
magnetic mountain resort, thrives on adrenaline. Site of the first
commercial bungee-jumping operation — established in 1988 over the
Kawarau River — Queenstown is the place to test your courage by jumping
off, flying over or skimming above things. During the winter (June
through September), visitors flock to four ski areas in the surrounding
Southern Alps. The rest of the year, Queenstown serves as the gateway to
[Mount Aspiring National
Park](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/mount-aspiring-national-park/),
Fiordland National Park in the west, and countless hikes, including
multiday treks on the
[Milford](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/milford-track/),
[Routeburn](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/fiordland/places/fiordland-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/routeburn-track/)
[Greenstone and
Caples](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/greenstone-and-caples-conservation-areas/things-to-do/greenstone-and-caples-tracks/)
tracks. In March, the beginning of fall, the crowds have eased but the
weather is still great for outdoor adventures. The [Akarua Arrowtown
Autumn Festival](https://arrowtownautumnfestival.co.nz/) in nearby
Arrowtown is from April 16 to 20, and the [LUMA Southern Light
Project,](http://luma.nz/) which brings light installations to
Queenstown Gardens, takes place May 29 to June 1. On the shores of
glacially carved Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand’s third largest lake,
Queenstown offers a respite from the wild with sophisticated dining and
shopping, each with a distinct Kiwi accent.

## Friday

### <span>**1) 4 p.m. Panoramic perches**</span>

To get a sense of the jewel-like, mountain-encircled setting of
Queenstown, go vertical one of two ways. Ride the [Skyline
Gondola](https://www.skyline.co.nz/en/queenstown/) (44 New Zealand
dollars, or about $28) to ascend some 1,475 feet to the top of Bob’s
Peak, high enough to appreciate how the town hugs the protected bays of
the lightning-bolt-shaped lake, and the wall of mountains in the
distance, known as the Remarkables (recognizable to “Lord of the Rings”
film fans). In true Kiwi fashion, the gondola provides extra thrills
once you reach the top, including a sled luge track (from 61 dollars,
including gondola), but there’s plenty of awe-inspiring scenery to
freely appreciate along its mountaintop hiking trails. To save gondola
fare entirely, get a similar high via the 1,640-foot climb up the
[Queenstown Hill Time
Walk](https://www.newzealand.com/us/feature/queenstown-hill-time-walk/).

### <span>**2) 7 p.m. Dinner and a show**</span>

Billing itself as a community hotel, the [Sherwood
Queenstown](https://sherwoodqueenstown.nz/), a former Tudor-inspired
motel given a hipster overhaul on a hillside just outside of the
downtown area, has become a destination for locals and travelers
interested in culture and sustainability. Join in by reserving a table
at its restaurant, provisioned in part by its own gardens. Locavore
dishes might include green salad from the garden (10 dollars), venison
tartare (18 dollars) and barbecued lamb (32 dollars). On weekend
evenings, there’s a good chance a concert will be going on in its
intimate lounge; at the very least, there are outdoor fires around which
to mingle and gaze at the starry night
sky.

## Saturday

### <span>**3) 8 a.m. Breakfast and browsing**</span>

Rise and shine before the breakfast lines form at [Bespoke
Kitchen](https://www.bespokekitchen.co.nz/), the four-year-old cafe
known for its use of organic produce. The menu reinvents breakfast by
offering substantial vegan chile tofu scramble (20.50 dollars),
gluten-free potato, fennel and summer greens hash with a fried egg (20
dollars), and even a spicy pulled chicken burger (23.50 dollars). Dine
in the sunny, window-wrapped space or on shady patios. Afterward, stroll
a few blocks to the harbor to attend the [Creative Queenstown Arts and
Crafts Market](http://www.queenstownmarket.com/), which sets up every
Saturday morning, offering ceramics, knitwear, photography, graphic
design and more.

<div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**4) 10 a.m. Thrill ride**</span>

Any walk around Queenstown will introduce the range of adventure options
on offer by outfitters here, including bungee jumping, bungee swinging,
skydiving, paragliding, rafting and heli-touring. Among the most
thrilling is jet boating in vessels propelled by water ejected behind
boats that are designed to skim over New Zealand’s shallow rivers. The
Maori-owned [Shotover Jet](https://www.shotoverjet.com/) races on the
Shotover River in depths as shallow as about four inches in a
14-passenger jet boat, then enters the narrow canyons where the company
has exclusive access. Boats seemingly clear the rock walls by inches,
thrills that are amplified by spinning 360 degrees (159 dollars).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**5) 12:30 p.m. A burger worth waiting for**</span>

Who is Ferg, the man who scowls from signage around
[Fergburger](https://www.fergburger.com/), the cult burger joint
generating long lines at all hours? The restaurant claims that in 2001
he decreed, “Let there be burgers fir (sic) the people to eat when they
are drunk to hell.” He may be fictional, but the quality of the burgers
is real. Lines of fans, drunk or not, snake down Shotover Street for
nearly all of the 21 hours it is open daily. Menu choices thoroughly
explore the burger range, from the standard beef Fergburger (12.50
dollars) to the venison Sweet Bambi (14.40 dollars) and the Little Lamby
made with New Zealand lamb (14.40 dollars). Jockey for a seat at one of
the few tables after ordering, or take your lunch to the beach about a
two-minute walk away.

### <span>**6) 2 p.m. Onsen Zen**</span>

Escape the crowds for an hour while basking in the views from a cedar
hot tub at the recently expanded [Onsen Hot
Pools](https://www.onsen.co.nz/). Nine tubs overlook a scenic bend in
the Shotover River from individual rooms with retractable windows that
open the spa to the outdoors, and another five reside in the gardens
outdoors. Book a four-person-capacity tub by the hour (from 87.50
dollars for one, or up to 212 dollars for four), which includes a glass
of beer, wine or juice and a snack. Advance booking is highly
recommended; reservations often run weeks in advance.

### <span>**7) 4:30 p.m. Kiwi-style shopping**</span>

Spend an hour browsing the many shops and galleries of Queenstown,
filled with Kiwi brands like [Swanndri](https://www.swanndri.co.nz/),
makers of the classic “Swanny,” or long woolen bush shirt, and the
outdoor clothier [Icebreaker](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/home),
which specializes in natural fabrics. For gifts and graphics, visit
[Vesta Design Boutique,](https://www.vestadesign.co.nz/) housed in
William’s Cottage, which was built in 1864 on the lakefront and is
registered as Queenstown’s oldest house. Inside, check out limited
edition prints of the mountains by Nicola Tucker, prints of New Zealand
native birds by Marika Jones, and vintage-inspired travel posters of the
region.

### <span>**8) 6 p.m. Remarkable sunsets**</span>

Pick a spot to toast sunset in Queenstown, where the Alpenglow paints
the distant Remarkables mountains pink.
[Reds](https://www.qthotelsandresorts.com/queenstown/eat-drink/reds/)
bar, at the QT Queenstown hotel, specializes in Negronis, including
classic and barrel-aged selections (19 dollars). The modernist lounge
features window-seat-to-ceiling windows that frame views of the aptly
named range as tour boats ply the lake below. Alternatively, from the
main beach in town, pop into [The
Bathhouse](https://www.bathhouse.co.nz/), a vintage 1911 bathhouse with
a distinctive crown on the roof now converted into a popular lakefront
cafe. (Bear in mind sunset in Queenstown, at 45 degrees latitude south,
may come as late as 9:30 p.m. in
summer.)

Like those of many upscale mountain towns, the Queenstown dining scene
offers strong carnivorous choices, including [Botswana
Butchery](https://www.botswanabutchery.co.nz/queenstown/) and [Jervois
Steak House](https://www.jervoissteakhouse.co.nz/queenstown). But for a
sense of the terroir of southern New Zealand, book a table at
[Rata](https://www.ratadining.co.nz/), named for a native tree. A
backlit photo mural of a mossy rainforest in Fiordland National Park
sets a tranquil tone in the open-plan dining room featuring local
polished stone and warm wood, and presided over by the chef Josh Emett.
Regional ingredients fill the menu, which changes daily and recently
included kingfish crudo (24 dollars), grass-fed beef tartare with
Canterbury truffles (24 dollars), venison loin with onion purée (48
dollars) and slow-braised lamb shoulder for two (50 dollars per person).
Finish with a tableside visit from the trolley filled with New Zealand
cheeses (three for 20 dollars).

Queenstown is a party town, from the lakefront where budget travelers
flock with six-packs of beer, to classic pubs and swanky cocktail
parlors, including [Upstairs @ The
Bunker](https://www.thebunker.co.nz/). Above the restaurant of the same
name, the lounge features vintage black-and-white photos of Hollywood
stars like Audrey Hepburn, and nattily dressed bartenders shaking up
craft cocktails in an intimate, fire-lit room. On the patio, drink a
frothy “From Russia With Love,” with vodka and peach liqueur (19
dollars) while watching old James Bond movies screened silently on an
adjacent wall.

## Sunday

### <span>**11) 8 a.m. Make tracks**</span>

There are hiking trails, also known as tracks in New Zealand, all around
Queenstown. Driving north along the Glenorchy-Queenstown Road about 15
or 20 minutes leads to several inspiring walks, including the [Moke Lake
Loop
Track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/queenstown-area/things-to-do/moke-lake-loop-track/?region=otago&park=346498f5-d802-46e4-b38c-92dca1c96f0a&activity=walking-trampin).
Under four miles, the easy trail rings a highland lake that reflects the
steep and treeless mountains surrounding it. If it’s warm, stick to Lake
Wakatipu and take the short [Bob’s Cove
Trail](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/queenstown-area/things-to-do/bobs-cove-track-and-nature-walk/),
which leads to the rocky lakefront within minutes. Take the plunge into
the bracing water from the pier on the far side of the cove.

### <span>**12) 10 a.m. Rush the gold**</span>

Go Sunday driving to [Arrowtown](https://www.arrowtown.com/), about 13
miles from Queenstown, where gold was originally found in 1862 in the
Arrow River, sparking a short, but intense, gold rush that left behind
about 70 vintage structures, many now housing shops, cafes, galleries
and restaurants. The [Lakes District Museum &
Gallery](http://www.museumqueenstown.com/) (admission 10 dollars) tells
the story of Arrowtown’s history, from its indigenous Maori roots as
hunting grounds for moa (including a display of bones from the extinct
bird) to the establishment of a Chinese village of miners. Stop for a
local beer and a bite at [The Fork and
Tap](http://www.theforkandtap.co.nz/), a family-friendly pub with a
generous outdoor patio, or taste a few pinot noirs from the nearby
Central Otago wine region at [The Winery](https://www.thewinery.co.nz/),
a wine shop dispensing samples from vintners around the country.

-----

## Lodging

The lively [Sherwood Queenstown](https://sherwoodqueenstown.nz/) has 78
motel rooms updated in industrial-meets-bohemian style with army
blankets atop beds and oversize cushions made from recycled kilim rugs.
The restaurant is a destination in itself, and monthly programming
includes art workshops and concerts. Rooms from 180 dollars.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are plenty of short-term rentals in Queenstown. Rates start around
74 dollars for a room in a centrally located
[condo](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4271035?adults=2&source_impression_id=p3_1570722838_kiwb5ARjO1QVZWCW&guests=1&check_in=2020-03-03&check_out=2020-03-05),
