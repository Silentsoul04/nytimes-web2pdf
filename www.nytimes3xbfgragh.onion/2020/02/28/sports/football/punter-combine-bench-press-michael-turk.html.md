Let it never be said that N.F.L. prospects do not support each other.

As Michael Turk, a 21-year-old punter out of Arizona State, approached
the bench press at the N.F.L. draft scouting combine in Indianapolis on
Thursday, he was cheered on by a crowd of prospects undoubtedly baffled
by the sight of the only punter participating in the test. The crowd’s
encouragement, and the enthusiasm of Turk’s spotter, Chad Englehart,
helped power the special teams hopeful to 25 repetitions of 225 pounds —
a record for a punter since the N.F.L. began keeping official combine
statistics in 2003.

In a [video of the
performance](http://www.nfl.com/m/share?p=%2Fvideos%2Fnfl-combine%2F0ap3000001103823%2FPunter-Michael-Turk-puts-up-25-reps-on-bench-press),
Turk hesitates after 21 reps, but with the crowd roaring, and Englehart,
a strength and conditioning coach for the Washington Redskins shouting
for him to continue, Turk powered his way to four more. The enthusiasm
as Turk lifted, and the reaction online afterward, somewhat overshadowed
Henry Ruggs III, a wide receiver out of Alabama who [recorded
a 4.27-second 40-yard
dash](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001103981/article/henry-ruggs-clocks-428-unofficial-40yard-dash-at-nfl-combine)
on Thursday — tied for the fourth-fastest time since 2006.

To say Turk set a bench press record for a punter, however, would
understate the feat, because punters rarely participate in the weight
lifting portion of the combine. For better context, consider some of the
players who completed fewer reps of the same weight in recent years:

  - Bradley Chubb, a 270-pound defensive end who was selected fifth
    overall in 2018, [recorded 24
    reps](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/2018-combine.htm).

  - T.J. Watt, a 252-pound linebacker who was first-team All-Pro in
    2019, [recorded 21 reps
    in 2017](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/2017-combine.htm).

  - Derrick Henry, Tennessee’s [wrecking
    ball](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/16/sports/derrick-henry-titans-playoffs.html)
    of a running back, [did 22 reps
    in 2016](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/2016-combine.htm).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Fittingly, Turk’s [scouting report on
NFL.com](https://www.nfl.com/prospects/michael-turk?id=32195455-5206-5453-d33e-d486b96be9fa)
lists this as one of his strengths: “Very thickly muscled with arms that
look like logs.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even before his combine performance, Turk had stood out among his peers
by declaring as an early entrant for the draft after his junior season,
a move not typically employed by place-kickers or punters.

“I know it’s kind of unconventional,” Turk said [in an interview with a
TV station in
Arizona](https://www.azfamily.com/sports/college_sports/speak_of_the_devils/faith-in-himself-and-in-above-led-asu-punter-michael/article_1f62bbbc-38b9-11ea-8128-c39d21e85480.html)
in January.

Turk is the nephew of Matt Turk, who had a 17-season career as an N.F.L.
punter, and Dan Turk, who played 15 seasons as a long snapper. The
younger Turk stands 6 feet tall and weighs 226 pounds — far short of
Matt Turk’s 6 feet 5 inches and 251 pounds, and Dan Turk’s 6 feet 4
inches and 290 pounds.

While upper-body strength may not seem key to Michael Turk’s position,
his performance gave the prospect bragging rights over every wide
receiver who participated in the test and all but one tight end.
(Cincinnati’s Josiah Deguara [tied Turk with 25
reps](https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josiah-deguara?id=32194445-4770-3400-9fe2-3240dc1a9dab).)

Turk’s performance also bested 21 of 23 running backs, 25 of 27
linebackers, 21 of 38 defensive linemen and 19 of 39 offensive linemen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Perhaps of more interest to N.F.L. teams than his bench-press
performance: Turk, who played one season for the Sun Devils after having
begun his career at Lafayette, averaged 46.0 yards a punt last season,
with a long of 75 in a season-opening win over Kent State. If anything,
the knock on him in his brief Division I career was that he frequently
outkicked the coverage.

Fans hoping that their team decides to invest in a punter with more
upper-body strength at 21 than defensive end Jadeveon Clowney ([21 reps
in 2014](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/2014-combine.htm))
had at that age will have to be patient, as punters are rarely taken
before the fifth round. In some years none are drafted.

The combine, which helps teams assess draft prospects through a series
of interviews and drills, continues through Monday, with defensive
linemen and linebackers taking the field on Saturday and defensive backs
being tested on Sunday.

This year’s N.F.L. draft will be held from April 23 to 25 in Las Vegas.

the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback from Louisiana State, is widely
expected to be taken by Cincinnati with the No. 1 over all pick, even
after his hands measured a bit smaller than expected during the
combine’s measuring phase, a result he [openly mocked
online](https://twitter.com/Joe_Burrow10/status/1232071931249254402).
