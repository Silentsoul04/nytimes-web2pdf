The administration’s response to the coronavirus has repeatedly matched

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — After weeks of conflicting signals from the Trump
administration about the coronavirus, the government’s top health
officials decided late last month that when President Trump returned
from a trip to India, they would tell him they had to be more blunt
about the dangers of the outbreak.

If he approved, they would level with the public.

But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for
Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, got a day ahead of the plan. At noon on Feb. 25, just as
Mr. Trump was boarding Air Force One in New Delhi for his flight home,
she told reporters on a conference call that life in the United States
was about to change.

“The disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she said. Schools
might have to close, conferences could be canceled, businesses might
make employees work from home. She had told her own children, she said,
to prepare for “significant disruption to our lives.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The stock market plummeted, cable news blared apocalyptic headlines and
by the time Mr. Trump landed at Joint Base Andrews early the next
morning, his critics were accusing him of sowing confusion on an issue
of life or death.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president immediately got on the phone with Alex M. Azar II, his
secretary of health and human services. That call scared people, he
shouted, referring to Dr. Messonnier’s warnings. Are we at the point
that we will have to start closing schools? the president added,
alarmed, according to an official who heard about the call.

To health officials, the message needed to change with the outbreak.
“The epicenter was shifting” as the number of new cases outside China
surpassed those inside, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy
director of the C.D.C. “The issue of what this might mean to us became
more important.”

From the beginning, the Trump administration’s attempts to forestall an
[outbreak of a
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/07/us/coronavirus-cpac.html)
now spreading rapidly across the globe was marked by a raging internal
debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth. Even as the
government’s scientists and leading health experts raised the alarm
early and pushed for aggressive action, they faced resistance and doubt
at the White House — especially from the president — about [spooking
financial
markets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/01/business/economy/trump-democrats-coronavirus-economy.html)
and inciting panic.

“It’s going to all work out,” Mr. Trump said as recently as Thursday
night. “Everybody has to be calm. It’s going to work out.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Health experts say that telling people to remain calm is an effective
message in an epidemic, and it is appropriate that it come from the
president. Clear, honest communication is also crucial, and the United
States has at times criticized China and other governments for being
less than
transparent.

But from Mr. Trump’s first comments on the virus in January to [rambling

C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html)
on Friday, health experts say the administration has struggled to strike
an effective balance between encouraging calm, providing key information
and leading an assertive response. The confused signals from the Trump
administration, they say, left Americans unprepared for a public health
crisis and delayed their understanding of [a virus that has
reached](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
at least 28 states, infected more than 300 people and killed at least

## A Very Big Deal

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Azar was at his home in suburban Washington, on Friday, Jan. 3, when
Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C.’s director, called to tell him China
had potentially discovered [a new
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html).
Mr. Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive who helped manage the
response to earlier SARS and anthrax outbreaks, told his chief of staff
to make sure that the National Security Council was aware.

This is a very big deal, Mr. Azar told him.

The Trump administration had eliminated the global health unit that had
been part of the National Security Council, but within days, a team was
meeting daily in the basement of the West Wing, pleading with Chinese
officials to allow doctors from the C.D.C. into their country.

For weeks, the Chinese refused offers of public health cooperation.
“China nice-talked it for a month,” said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, a top
official at the Department of Homeland Security who was working on the
coronavirus effort. “‘Oh, well, thank you for the offer. Blah, blah.’”

On Saturday, Jan. 18, a day after the C.D.C. [dispatched 100 people to
three American
airports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/17/health/china-coronavirus-airport-screening.html)
to screen travelers coming from Wuhan, China, Mr. Azar made his first
call to Mr. Trump about the virus, dialing him directly at Mar-a-Lago,
his Florida estate. The president insisted on talking about e-cigarettes
first, but Mr. Azar steered him to the virus.

Four days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in

fine.”

On the evening of Jan. 28, a new kind of crisis broke out in the skies.

The State Department had ordered [the evacuation of the American
Consulate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/29/world/asia/wuhan-china-coronavirus-evacuations.html)
in Wuhan and a 747 was in the air. But as it headed for the United
States with hundreds of passengers who possibly carried the virus,
administration officials in Washington were in a frantic scramble about
where it should land.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and
response, tried to secure some kind of military base in California, but
was struggling to cut through Pentagon red tape. In a panic, his staff
started booking hundreds of rooms at three hotels in the Los Angeles
area, asking for full floors so they could separate potentially infected
evacuees from other guests.

One idea was to land the plane at the Ontario airport outside Los
Angeles, and officials went so far as to schedule, then cancel, a
briefing for some members of the California congressional delegation.
After hours of wrangling, and with the plane still in the air, Mark T.
Esper, the defense secretary, said the plane could land at March Air
Reserve Base in Riverside County, which had space to house all of the
passengers.

Inside the White House, a debate broke out, centered on concerns that
had become ever-present since the virus first emerged: How would the
government’s actions be perceived by the public? And what would the
president think?

At issue was whether to impose a federal quarantine order on the
evacuees to prevent them from leaving for 14 days. Such authority had
not been used since a smallpox outbreak in 1969. But officials had to
find some way to make sure the passengers did not leave the base until
it was clear they were not infected.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Azar pushed for the order but others were wary, concerned it could
cause panic. They decided to ask the passengers to voluntarily stay at
the military base. One woman balked, so California officials, who use
quarantine authority more often, stepped in and forced the passengers to
stay.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China,
the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day. Any one of
them could be the trigger for a new and undetected American outbreak.

Over four days in the White House Situation Room, the nation’s top
public health and national security officials engaged in a fierce debate
over whether to take the extraordinary step of banning travel from
China.

Public health officials were initially wary. Experts have long
recommended against restricting travel during outbreaks, arguing that it
is often ineffective and can stymie the response by limiting the
movements of doctors and other health professionals trying to contain
the disease. A ban would anger China, they worried, ending any hope of
cooperation with American medical teams.

Officials at the National Security Council and Department of Homeland
Security argued that China had already proved unwilling to cooperate. A
third group inside the White House was worried that the move would
incite panic and could roil the financial
markets.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

By Thursday, Jan. 30, the public health officials had come around. Mr.
Azar, Dr. Redfield and [Dr. Anthony S.
Fauci](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/11/us/politics/anthony-fauci-coronavirus.html),
the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, agreed that a ban on travel from the epidemic’s center could
buy some time to put into place prevention and testing measures. “There
was so much we didn’t know about this virus,” Dr. Redfield said in an
interview. “We were rapidly understanding it was much more
transmissible, that it had a great ability to go global.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The debate moved that afternoon to the Oval Office, where Mr. Azar and
others urged the president to approve the ban. “The situation has
changed radically,” Mr. Azar told Mr. Trump.

Others in the room urged being more cautious, arguing that a ban could
have unforeseen consequences. “This is unprecedented,” warned Kellyanne
Conway, the president’s counselor. Mr. Trump was skeptical, though he
would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea.
The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time
to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the
economy?

The president sided with his more aggressive aides, and [announced the
ban next
day](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html).

Still, Mr. Trump was publicly upbeat about the effects of the virus. At
a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health
Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, [he said
of the
coronavirus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/11/politics/trump-new-hampshire-rally/index.html),
“By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it
miraculously goes away.”

In fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.

A system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just
as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at
a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator
masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the
government’s reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and
many of those had expired.

And a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed
component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the
nation’s testing capacity for weeks, despite assurances by the
administration that it was quickly being resolved.

Americans [stranded in Japan on a cruise
ship](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/22/world/asia/coronavirus-japan-cruise-ship.html),
the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the
president [became
enraged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/22/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cruise-ship.html)
when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the
virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.

He later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested
positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people
infected in the United States.

The month ended with [a whistle-blower’s
claim](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/us/politics/coronavirus-us-whistleblower.html)
that workers from the Department of Health and Human Services had been
sent to greet returning Americans from China at two military bases in
California without the personal protective gear that is required for
anyone coming into contact with potentially exposed patients. None of
the workers tested positive for the virus, but the allegation shook
Congress.

The president’s motorcade pulled onto the main C.D.C. campus in Atlanta
just before 4:30 p.m. on Friday, passing protesters holding signs that
said “Have faith in science” and “We need a vaccine against Trump.”

Ten weeks after the virus first emerged in China, the total number of
confirmed cases in the world surged past 100,000 and public health
experts warned darkly that the outbreak was far from over. The United
States, they said, faces weeks, if not months, of uncertainty and
continued disruptions in education, businesses, commerce, medicine,
government and daily life.

“Time matters,” Dr. Redfield said in an interview on Friday.

Last week, Vice President Mike Pence [was given control of the public
messaging](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/us/politics/us-coronavirus-pence.html),
and although Mr. Pence has [had some mixed
messages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/politics/pence-trump-coronavirus.html)
of his own — he promised more tests before they were available — the
White House has since displayed more discipline. Mr. Pence holds twice
daily conference calls with officials from across the country, and a
virus task force he leads issues daily talking points, with comment from
the health professionals, to make sure the message is consistent.

But the president still has his bullhorn. During his visit to the
C.D.C., Mr. Trump told reporters that he was not inclined to let 21
people who tested positive for the virus on a cruise ship off the coast
of California onto American soil.

“They would like to have the people come off,” he said. “I would like to
have the people stay.” The president said he would allow health experts
to make the final decision, but he made clear again where he stood.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His concern? It would increase the tally for the number of people
infected in the United States. “Because I like the numbers being where
they are,” the president said.
