A local philanthropist couple is donating more than 100 pieces to the
museum, including works by Matisse, Wyeth and Picasso.

Some Clevelanders express love for their city by cheering on the Browns
during the NFL season or defending Cleveland's claim to be
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/02/us/02superman.html}{Superman's
spiritual birthplace}. Joseph P. Keithley and Nancy F. Keithley went a
different route. On Wednesday, the
\href{https://www.clevelandart.org/}{Cleveland Museum of Art} announced
that the Keithleys, prominent local philanthropists, have donated more
than 100 artworks by Henri Matisse, Camille Pissarro, Andrew Wyeth and
others to the institution.

``Cleveland is our home,'' Ms. Keithley said in a statement. ``It is
important to us to share our collection with our fellow Northeast
Ohioans, and we felt the Cleveland Museum of Art was a perfect home for
the works of art we have assembled.''

Of the pieces, 97 are outright gifts to be donated right away, while 17
are promised and will be added to the C.M.A. collection in the future.
Among the first works to join the collection are three paintings by
Pierre Bonnard, two by George Braque and one by Pablo Picasso. The
donations, which also include Chinese and Japanese ceramics and
watercolors by the American painter John Marin, are valued at more than
\$100 million in total, according to the museum.

Work by \href{https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1953.212}{members of the
Nabis group} is especially well represented in the Keithley's gift,
enhancing the museum's already impressive collection of French modern
art. 16 paintings, six drawings and three prints by artists associated
with the Post-Impressionist movement are included in the donated
material. The gift also adds paintings by Henri-Edmond Cross, Vilhelm
Hammershoi, Félix Valloton, Jan Verkade, Nicolas de Stael and Wyeth to
the holdings at C.M.A.

William Griswold, the museum's director and president, explained that
historically the institution has added to its collection by carefully
purchasing new works. But the competitive art market, he said, means
that donations are an increasingly important source for acquisitions.
``Among the works in the Keithley collection, for example, there are
many that would have been very difficult for us to have acquired on our
own,'' he said in an interview.

Visitors to the museum won't have to wait long to see some of the
donated works. A selection will be on display beginning March 17 in the
museum's permanent collection galleries. A more comprehensive exhibition
of the Keithley gift is scheduled for fall 2022.
