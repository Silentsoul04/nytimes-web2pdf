Fall}\label{boston-and-london-marathons-postponed-until-fall}}

The Boston Marathon, which was scheduled for April 20, has been
postponed until Sept. 14. The London Marathon has been rescheduled for
Oct. 4, instead of April 26.

After resisting calls to cancel the race for weeks, the Boston Athletic
Association announced Friday that the Boston Marathon would be postponed
until September because of mounting concerns about the coronavirus
pandemic.

Shortly after that announcement, another major race, the London
Marathon, was postponed. It had been scheduled for April 26, six days
after the Boston Marathon. For some British runners the London race
would have served as a qualifier for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in
late July, another event that could be canceled or postponed because of
the pandemic, though organizers have insisted the Olympics will take
place as planned.

The Boston Marathon will be held Sept. 14. The London Marathon will take
place on Oct. 4.

The announcements injected new turmoil into the spring long-distance
running season, both for elite runners, who often plan on participating
in one marathon in the fall and one in the spring, and weekend warriors.

``On matters of public health and safety we take our guidance from the
officials entrusted with protecting the public in this area,'' said Tom
Grilk, chief executive of the B.A.A. ``We understand our role, along
with our partners, in ensuring a safe environment for all participants,
volunteers, spectators, and supporters that meets the standards set by
those officials.''

Boston's 26.2-mile race first took place in 1897 and has been held
annually through wars, periods of domestic tension, and in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/16/sports/boston-marathon.html}{intense
weather}.

Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston also noted the race brings more than
\$200 million to the city.

``So you think about the economic impact on the city but the bottom line
is my job as mayor is to make sure that people are safe,'' Mayor Walsh
said earlier this week.

The race, which follows a course from Hopkinton, in Boston's western
suburbs, to downtown Boston, has a field of 30,000 runners, and hundreds
of thousands more line the streets to watch. Other than the Olympic
trials, it is the only major marathon in the country that most runners
have to qualify for by running fast enough to meet a standard for their
age group.

It is a major accomplishment for weekend warriors, and the qualifying
times last for one year only. The athletic association does not allow
runners to defer their entries for a year if they get injured. About
6,000 runners get into the race by committing to raise money for
charity.

The London Marathon attracts 40,000 runners, many of whom come from
across Europe, and had little choice but postpone its event. ``The world
is in an unprecedented situation grappling with a global pandemic of
COVID-19 and public health is everyone's priority,'' Hugh Brasher, the
director of the race,
\href{https://www.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/en-gb/news-media/latest-news/item/2020-virgin-money-london-marathon-postponed-to-sunday-4-october/}{said
in a statement}.

More than 750,000 spectators were expected to cheer on the 40,000
runners through the streets of London. That includes some of the top
elite marathoners in the world, including the defending champions and
world record
holders\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/12/sports/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-record.html}{Eliud
Kipchoge}
and\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/13/sports/marathon-world-record.html}{Brigid
Kosgei}. The marathon was going to create a rare showdown between
Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia, who missed breaking Kipchoge's
record by just two seconds in October.

On Twitter, Kipchoge said that the news was ``unfortunate'' but that he
respected the decision.

Both races are part of the
\href{https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/}{Abbott World Marathon
Majors}, a collection of the six largest marathons in the world. This is
the third marathon in the series impacted by the novel coronavirus. The
Tokyo Marathon was restricted to elite athletes.

Those elite athletes rely heavily on appearance fees at major races for
income, but their bodies can usually only handle two in a calendar year.
With Boston and London moving into the same season as marathons in New
York, Berlin and Chicago, it's likely the top runners may receive just
one major race payday in 2020 instead of the usual two.

Coronavirus has wreaked havoc with the global road racing schedule, with
organizations following different strategies. The Tel Aviv Marathon,
scheduled for late February, prohibited anyone from flying into the
country to run the race. The Paris Marathon, scheduled for April,
postponed the event until October, as did the Barcelona Marathon.

More than 455,000 people finished a marathon in the United States in
2019, according to statistics compiled by findmymarathon.com. With races
being canceled each week, the number is expected to drop substantially
in 2020.
