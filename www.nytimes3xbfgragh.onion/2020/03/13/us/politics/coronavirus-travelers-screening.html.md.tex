Screening}\label{travelers-from-coronavirus-hot-spots-say-they-faced-no-screening}}

The Trump administration says Americans returning from coronavirus hot
spots are being screened for symptoms. Some travelers say that is not
happening.

WASHINGTON --- As thousands of Americans flee from Europe and other
centers of the coronavirus outbreak, many travelers are reporting no
health screenings upon departure and few impediments at U.S. airports
beyond a welcome home greeting.

Since January, officers from Customs and Border Protection have been on
heightened alert for travelers who could potentially spread the virus.
The Department of Homeland Security has told employees to look for
visible physical symptoms and search through their travel documents and
a federal database that tracks where they came from.

Those customs officers will soon have to spot symptoms among a flood of
more Americans funneled to 13 designated airports from multiple
countries in Europe, an administration official said, after President
Trump announced new travel restrictions on the region this week.

But travelers, including some who say they showed visible signs of
illness, say screening has been lax. Members of Congress this week
grilled senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security over
what some described as a porous screening process. And customs officers
at airports question how accurately they can pinpoint people with
symptoms and what safeguards are being taken to protect their health.

Even top officials at the department acknowledge the task of sealing the
United States from the virus is impossible.

``This has never been from Day 1 intended to be a hermetically sealed
process,'' said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting deputy secretary of
homeland security. ``We are trying to reduce and delay the biggest peak
in the virus wave hitting on the United States of America. And all of
these steps reduce and delay. They do not stop of the virus.''

``Viruses do not care about boundaries,'' he said.

Maggie McDow, 46, said she had swollen glands when she landed at Dulles
International Airport outside Washington, one of the airports where
travelers who have recently been in China or Iran are being funneled.
Ms. McDow had flown from London, but before that, she had stopped in
South Korea, a coronavirus hot spot.

Ms. McDow said she heard plenty of instructions from airport officials
for those feeling ill in airports abroad. But when she reached the
United States, she said, ``There was none of that.'' A customs officer
stamped her passport, and she was on her way.

``No one asked where I had traveled. I guess they just assumed we all
were just coming from London and so no big deal,'' Ms. McDow wrote in an
email because she was too sick to speak on the phone and has yet to be
tested for the coronavirus.

The Trump administration has barred entry to foreigners who in the past
14 days have visited China, Iran, and beginning at 11:59 p.m. Friday, 26
countries in the European Union. The administration has also told
customs officers to use the federal travel database, documents and
interviews with travelers to determine who to refer to a health
screening at the airport. Officers are also required to refer those with
symptoms coming from South Korea or Italy to be screened by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Stephanie Malin, a
spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/03/13/us/politics/13dc-virus-travlers/merlin_170418252_274d9fc5-c016-4849-b311-bc1f06428430-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Ms. Malin said that as of March 4, more than 63,000 travelers at
airports, seaports and the land border had been referred by a Customs
and Border Protection officer for a health screening. Mr. Cuccinelli
said last week at a Senate homeland security hearing that the screenings
had been successful at slowing the outbreak.

``It bought us time,'' Mr. Cuccinelli said.

In addition to barring foreigners from 26 European countries, President
Trump's new travel restrictions will funnel Americans to designated
airports in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Honolulu,
Los Angeles, Atlanta, Virginia, Detroit, Dallas, Newark, Boston and
Miami. The travelers will be subjected to enhanced health screenings,
according to a federal register notice published on Friday.

The crush of Americans returning from Europe will make those screenings
that much harder.

Tony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union,
which represents officers from the section of Customs and Border
Protection that conducts screening at airports in the United States,
said officers were concerned about travelers not being truthful, or not
knowing, about their symptoms.

``They are worried about the imprecise distinctions on when travelers
may be contagious,'' Mr. Reardon said. ``They are also worried about
whether all passengers who are at risk based on their travel history are
being properly flagged for screening.''

Senior officials with Customs and Border Protection, speaking to
reporters on Friday on a conference call, highlighted the medical
safeguards enforced for its workers. The officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the agency had medical officials ready to
answer officers' questions and protective equipment such as masks for
employees. The agency is also using surveillance video to backtrack the
movements of any traveler who passed through an airport and later
developed symptoms of the coronavirus to determine if any officers were
exposed.

The officials declined to provide the number of employees who have been
tested or confirmed to have the disease.

Three security screeners with the Transportation Security Administration
at a Northern California airport have tested positive for the
coronavirus, the agency said this week. Two medical contractors employed
by the Homeland Security Department also learned last week that they had
the virus. The department closed a field office in Washington State for
two weeks this month after an employee contracted the disease.

``They are caught in the middle,'' said Gil Kerlikowske, the former
commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said of officers at the
agency. ``You're depending on them to do a host of things.''

He said that if travelers returned without being screened, it was
because federal agencies had given customs officers vague instructions.

Lawmakers have also shared those concerns.

Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, sent a letter to the
C.D.C. demanding it clarify what airport screening was being given to
travelers coming from South Korea and Italy. He highlighted two
passengers returning from Italy who had not been screened in Chicago but
later tested positive for the coronavirus.

William Yates, 28, said that did not happen to him. He did not undergo
any medical screening before he left Rome, with a layover in London, or
before boarding his flight from London to Phoenix. While he experienced
no symptoms, he believed he might be stopped since he visited
Emilia-Romagna, a region in Italy where provinces have been locked down
because of the outbreak.

When he arrived in Phoenix, he was asked only if he had visited Milan.

```Cool, welcome back.' And that was it,'' Mr. Yates said.

He is currently working from home as a precaution. A supervisor in an
emergency room, Mr. Yates did not want to risk spreading any illness to
other patients.
