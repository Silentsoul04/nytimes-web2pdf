More than 30,000 [K-12 schools in the United States are being
shuttered](https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-coronavirus-and-school-closures.html)
because of worries about spreading the coronavirus, affecting at least
20 million students, most of whom will be asked to shift to online
learning. Though [health experts
disagree](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/opinion/coronavirus-school-closing.html)
to what extent school closures will help, entire states,
including<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Ohio, Illinois and
Maryland, and some of the nation’s largest cities, including Los Angeles
and Houston, announced closings in recent days.

Educators experienced with remote learning warn that closures are a
serious threat to children’s academic progress, safety and social lives.
They say that running a classroom digitally is much harder than bringing
an adult workplace online, and that it can disproportionately affect
low-income students and those with special needs.

Here are some of the warnings and tips that teachers well-versed in
remote learning have for schools planning to move online.

## Not every home has computers or high-speed internet.

The [vast
majority](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/ACS-39.pdf)
of households with children have broadband internet, but there are still
big disparities by income, race and the education level of parents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Low-income families are more likely to rely on smartphones for internet
access, and children in those households may not be able to use more
sophisticated learning software that requires a tablet or computer. It
is not unusual, educators say, for siblings to try to complete their
schoolwork on a single cellphone.

Nate Ridgway, a social studies teacher at Beech Grove High School near
Indianapolis, regularly creates video lessons for his students. His
school also provides Chromebooks that students can take home. But when
his district had two “e-learning” days this year because of snow, he
noticed that some disadvantaged students fell behind academically.

“We as educators have to be so, so careful about this expectation that
we go completely online,” he said. “Anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of my
students may not have internet access at home.”

## Younger children require lots of adult supervision.

Younger students need help to learn online — lots of help. Parents may
need to [assist their
child](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/10/us/covid-19-seattle-washington-home-schooling-remote.html)
with turning on a device, logging into an app, reading instructions,
clicking in the right place, typing answers and staying on task.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even the tech-savviest adult will find this difficult while working from
home at the same time — a more common scenario as the coronavirus
spreads. Parents who continue to work outside the home when schools are
closed will need to arrange child care, where technical help could be
scarce.

In Salinas, Calif., Ben Cogswell prides himself on his tech-savvy
kindergarten classroom. He records videos of himself reading beloved
children’s books and reviewing words via flashcards. Many of his
students speak Spanish at home, and he hopes to strengthen their English
skills outside school hours.

But access to these resources can be a challenge, he said. Even though
the district provides all students with a Chromebook, not all parents —
even those with home WiFi — know how to connect that device to the
internet.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of the best things schools can do to prepare for closures, Mr.
Cogswell said, is to make sure parents can text message teachers and
connect to the apps and web resources their children will need.

Is the broader American education system ready?

“I would say no,” he
warned.

## Even great teachers lack expertise in creating online lessons.

While there are lots of exceptional teachers, not all of them are ready
to move their instruction online.

Online lessons need to have more clearly written-out themes and
directions for students, said Sarah Giddings, a teacher at WAVE, a high
school in Ypsilanti, Mich., that blends online and in-person learning.

“You can be a fantastic teacher, but writing curriculum is hard,” she
said.

Education technology firms have aggressively promoted their products as
school closures become more widespread. But educators who have pioneered
online learning say some of the best tools — like Google Hangouts or
Flipgrid, an interactive video platform — cost
nothing.

#### Back to School

Updated Sept. 11, 2020

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.

  -   - School officials in Des Moines are refusing to hold in-person
        classes, [despite an order from Iowa’s governor and a judge’s
        ruling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/des-moines-school-opening-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup),
        risking school funding and their jobs because they think it’s
        unsafe.
      - The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had one of the
        most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus
        under control. But it [failed to account for students
        partying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/health/university-illinois-covid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).
      - College students are [using apps to shame their

        better coronavirus plans.

“A teacher’s favorite price is free,” Mr. Ridgway said. He and other
educators warn against using learning tools that make it difficult to
log in, are inaccessible via mobile devices or require downloading
special software. Remote learning, they say, should simply require
signing into a
website.

## Students with special needs can be the hardest to teach virtually.

Christopher W. Bakk, a social studies teacher at Turning Point Academy
in Racine, Wis., has taught special education students both in-person
and remotely, via the Wisconsin eSchool Network.

Some of those students have behavioral issues and thrive online because
there are fewer social distractions, he said. But others find it
difficult to have less direct access to teachers and peers. “The
self-discipline is a struggle,” Mr. Bakk said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition, many students in this generation are nervous about speaking
over the phone, which Mr. Bakk said can be a crucial tool for teachers
to check on students who are learning at home. He approaches those
discussions with humor to help self-conscious teenagers relax.

“You have to ease their anxiety,” he said.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Schools provide more than academic skills.

Even when the devices, WiFi, software, lesson plans and adult
supervision are all in place, a lot is lost when schools transition
students to remote learning. Many children rely on schools for free or
affordable meals, for counseling and for after-school activities while
parents work.

When schools are closed, children lose a crucial social outlet. And
families, especially those who work in the service sector and cannot
easily adjust their schedules, can struggle to find appropriate child
care.

“If you think about it, the school is a city we provide to kids,” said
Mr. Ridgway. When that city shuts down, he said, no online learning
platform can replace all the structure and vibrancy that is lost.
