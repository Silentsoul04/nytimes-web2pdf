WASHINGTON — The House passed an emergency relief package Saturday to
address the sweeping effects of the coronavirus and cushion the economic
blow to the most vulnerable Americans.

The legislation includes a series of measures intended to bolster the
safety net for families and workers whose livelihoods and health are
affected by the virus. With President Trump weighing in late to voice
his approval, the Senate is expected to take up the package and could
pass it as early as next week.

It is unclear how much the package will cost, because the Congressional
Budget Office, the independent federal agency that assesses the revenue
effects of legislation, did not have time to calculate a price tag.

Here’s what’s in the package.

## There is paid sick leave for workers — but millions aren’t covered.

The measure gives some workers two weeks of paid sick leave and up to
three months of paid family and medical leave, equal to no less than
two-thirds of their pay. The provision is aimed at encouraging people to
follow the advice of public health officials who have said the best way
to contain the spread of the virus is to have anyone experiencing
symptoms stay at home.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But those benefits only apply to employees of businesses with fewer than
500 employees, or the government, who are infected by the virus,
quarantined, have a sick family member or are affected by school
closings. Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will
have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50
employees, if it determines that providing paid leave “would jeopardize
the viability of the business as a going
concern.”

Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers.
About [59 million Americans](https://www.bls.gov/web/cewbd/table_f.txt)
work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, and about [6.5 million of
them](https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2019/ownership/private/table31a.pdf)
do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies
with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days. (Some large
companies have announced since the outbreak began that they will provide
paid leave for workers who get the virus. [Walmart
said](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/03/10/new-covid-19-policy-to-support-the-health-of-our-associates)
it would give up to two weeks of pay; [Target
said](https://corporate.target.com/about/purpose-history/our-commitments/target-coronavirus-hub)
it would give 14 days.)

The bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a
quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some
public health experts have called for — effectively paying any worker to
stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.

It also excludes “certain health care providers and emergency
responders” from the benefit.

Companies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave.
The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the
costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the
outbreak.

The paid leave provisions were among the most contentious elements of
the legislation. Republicans objected to a proposal by Democrats to
establish a permanent paid sick leave entitlement for all families,
according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations, who spoke
on condition of anonymity to describe the private negotiations.

## It allows for free coronavirus testing for all, including the uninsured.

As the White House moved on Friday to catch up with the surging demand
for coronavirus testing, Ms. Pelosi emphasized that “testing, testing,
testing” would be the centerpiece of the legislation.

The final package includes a number of waivers to allow the costs of
tests to be covered by insurance and federal government programs. It
also includes a 6.2-percentage point increase in federal payments to
Medicaid for states.

There is also $64 million for the Indian Health Service to cover the
costs of coronavirus diagnostic testing for members of federally
recognized Native American tribes. The Department of Veterans Affairs
would receive $60 million to provide testing for veterans, while the
National Disaster Medical System would receive $1 billion to reimburse
the costs of testing and services to people without health insurance.

The bill includes about $1 billion for food security programs aimed at

pandemic, including those who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program, food banks, and the 22 million children who receive
free or reduced-price lunch at
school.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Those new funds include $500 million to help provide nutritious food to
low-income pregnant women or mothers with young children who lose their
jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and $400 million to help
local food banks purchase, store and distribute food. There is also $100
million to provide nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico, American
Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands and $250 million to provide
additional home-delivered and prepackaged meals to low-income seniors
who rely on federal programs.
