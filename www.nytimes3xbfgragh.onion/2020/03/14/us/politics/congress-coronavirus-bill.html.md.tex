Bill}\label{heres-whats-in-congresss-emergency-coronavirus-bill}}

The package includes free coronavirus testing for all, but its two weeks
of paid sick don't apply to many workers. The Senate is expected to take
up the measure early next week.

WASHINGTON --- The House passed an emergency relief package Saturday to
address the sweeping effects of the coronavirus and cushion the economic
blow to the most vulnerable Americans.

The legislation includes a series of measures intended to bolster the
safety net for families and workers whose livelihoods and health are
affected by the virus. With President Trump weighing in late to voice
his approval, the Senate is expected to take up the package and could
pass it as early as next week.

It is unclear how much the package will cost, because the Congressional
Budget Office, the independent federal agency that assesses the revenue
effects of legislation, did not have time to calculate a price tag.

Here's what's in the package.

\hypertarget{there-is-paid-sick-leave-for-workers--but-millions-arent-covered}{%
\subsection{There is paid sick leave for workers --- but millions aren't
covered.}\label{there-is-paid-sick-leave-for-workers--but-millions-arent-covered}}

The measure gives some workers two weeks of paid sick leave and up to
three months of paid family and medical leave, equal to no less than
two-thirds of their pay. The provision is aimed at encouraging people to
follow the advice of public health officials who have said the best way
to contain the spread of the virus is to have anyone experiencing
symptoms stay at home.

But those benefits only apply to employees of businesses with fewer than
500 employees, or the government, who are infected by the virus,
quarantined, have a sick family member or are affected by school
closings. Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will
have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50
employees, if it determines that providing paid leave ``would jeopardize
the viability of the business as a going concern.''

Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers.
About \href{https://www.bls.gov/web/cewbd/table_f.txt}{59 million

the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about

million of them} do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work
for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick
days. (Some large companies have announced since the outbreak began that
they will provide paid leave for workers who get the virus.

said} it would give up to two weeks of pay;
\href{https://corporate.target.com/about/purpose-history/our-commitments/target-coronavirus-hub}{Target
said} it would give 14 days.)

The bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a
quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some
public health experts have called for --- effectively paying any worker
to stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.

It also excludes ``certain health care providers and emergency
responders'' from the benefit.

Companies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave.
The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the
costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the
outbreak.

The paid leave provisions were among the most contentious elements of
the legislation. Republicans objected to a proposal by Democrats to
establish a permanent paid sick leave entitlement for all families,
according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations, who spoke
on condition of anonymity to describe the private negotiations.

The provision would expire in a year, at the insistence of Republicans,
and exemptions are available for small businesses.

\subsection{It allows for free coronavirus testing for all, including
the

As the White House moved on Friday to catch up with the surging demand
for coronavirus testing, Ms. Pelosi emphasized that ``testing, testing,
testing'' would be the centerpiece of the legislation.

The final package includes a number of waivers to allow the costs of
tests to be covered by insurance and federal government programs. It
also includes a 6.2-percentage point increase in federal payments to
Medicaid for states.

There is also \$64 million for the Indian Health Service to cover the
costs of coronavirus diagnostic testing for members of federally
recognized Native American tribes. The Department of Veterans Affairs
would receive \$60 million to provide testing for veterans, while the
National Disaster Medical System would receive \$1 billion to reimburse
the costs of testing and services to people without health insurance.

The bill includes about \$1 billion for food security programs aimed at
helping those who may struggle to get access to meals during the
pandemic, including those who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program, food banks, and the 22 million children who receive
free or reduced-price lunch at school.

Those new funds include \$500 million to help provide nutritious food to
low-income pregnant women or mothers with young children who lose their
jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and \$400 million to help
local food banks purchase, store and distribute food. There is also
\$100 million to provide nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico,
American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands and \$250 million to
provide additional home-delivered and prepackaged meals to low-income
seniors who rely on federal programs.

The legislation allows for emergency food assistance to households with
children who would receive free or reduced-price meals in school if they
close for five days or longer.

Democrats also included language that bars the administration from
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/politics/coronavirus-food-stamps-medicaid.html}{pushing

would be suspended during the coronavirus pandemic.

The legislation provides \$1 billion in 2020 for emergency grants to
states to assist with processing and paying unemployment insurance.

Half of those funds would be used to provide immediate additional
funding to all states for staffing, technology and other administrative
costs. The other half would be used for emergency grants to states that
experienced at least a 10-percent increase in unemployment.
