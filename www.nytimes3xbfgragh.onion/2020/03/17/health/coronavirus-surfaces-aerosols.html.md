The coronavirus can live for three days on some surfaces, like plastic
and steel, new research suggests. Experts say the risk of consumers
getting infected from touching those materials is still low, although
they offered additional warnings about how long the virus survives in
air, which may have important implications for medical workers.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new study, [published Tuesday in The New England Journal of
Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973), also
suggests that the virus disintegrates over the course of a day on
cardboard, lessening the worry among consumers that deliveries will
spread the virus during this period of staying and working from home.

When the virus becomes suspended in droplets smaller than five
micrometers — known as aerosols — it can stay suspended for about a
half-hour, researchers said, before drifting down and settling on
surfaces where it can linger for hours. (In the study’s experimental
setup, the virus stayed suspended for three hours, but it would drift
down much sooner under most conditions.) The finding on aerosol in
particular is inconsistent with the World Health Organization’s position
that the virus is not transported by air.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The virus lives longest on plastic and steel, surviving for up to 72
hours. But the amount of viable virus decreases sharply over this time.
It also does poorly on copper, surviving four hours. On cardboard, it
survives up to 24 hours, which suggests packages that arrive **** in the
mail should have only low levels of the virus **** — unless the delivery
person has coughed or sneezed on it or has handled it with contaminated
hands.

That’s true in general. Unless the people who handle any of these
materials are sick, the actual risk of getting infected from any of
these materials is low, experts said.

“Everything at the grocery store and restaurant takeout containers and
bags could in theory have infectious virus on them,” said Dr. Linsey
Marr, who was not a member of the research team but is an expert in the
transmission of viruses by aerosol at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. “We
could go crazy discussing these ‘what ifs’ because everyone is a
potential source, so we have to focus on the biggest
risks.”

If people are concerned about the risk, they could wipe down packages
with disinfectant wipes and wash their hands, she said.

It is unclear why cardboard should be a less hospitable environment for
the virus than plastic or steel, but it may be explained by the
absorbency or fibrous quality of the packaging compared with the other
surfaces.

That the virus can survive and stay infectious in aerosols is also
important for health care workers.

For weeks experts have maintained that the virus is not airborne. But in
fact, it can travel through the air and stay suspended for that period
of about a half-hour.

The virus does not linger in the air at high enough levels to be a risk
to most people who are not physically near an infected person. But the
procedures health care workers use to care for infected patients are
likely to generate aerosols.

“Once you get a patient in with severe pneumonia, the patients need to
be intubated,” said Dr. Vincent Munster, a virologist at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the study. “All
these handlings might generate aerosols and droplets.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Health care workers might also collect those tiny droplets and larger
ones on their protective gear when working with infected patients. They
might resuspend these big and small droplets into the air when they take
off this protective gear and become exposed to the virus then, Dr. Marr
cautioned.

A study that is being reviewed by experts [bears out this
fear](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.08.982637v1). And
another study, published March 4 in JAMA, also indicates that the virus
is transported by air. That study, based in Singapore, found the [virus
on a vent](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762692) in
the hospital room of an infected patient, where it could only have
reached via the air.

Dr. Marr said the World Health Organization had so far referred to the
virus as not airborne, but that health care workers should wear gear,
including respirator masks, assuming that it is.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Based on aerosol science and recent findings on flu virus,” she said,
“surgical masks are probably insufficient.”

Dr. Marr said based on physics, an aerosol released at a height of about
six feet would fall to the ground after 34 minutes. The findings should
not cause the general public to panic, however, because the virus
disperses quickly in the
air.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

“It sounds scary,” she said, “but unless you’re close to someone, the
amount you’ve been exposed to is very low.”

Dr. Marr compared this to cigarette smoke or a foggy breath on a frosty
day. The closer and sooner another person is to the exhaled smoke or
breath, the more of a whiff they might catch; for anyone farther than a
few feet away, there is too little of the virus in the air to be any
danger.

To assess the ability of the virus to survive in the air, the
researchers created what Dr. Munster described as “bizarre experiments
done under very ideal controllable experimental conditions.” They used a
rotating drum to suspend the aerosols, and provided temperature and
humidity levels that closely mimic hospital conditions.

In this setup, the virus survived and stayed infectious for up to three
hours, but its ability to infect drops sharply over this time, he said.

He said the aerosols might stay aloft only for about 10 minutes, but Dr.
Marr disagreed with that assessment, and said they could stay in the air
for three times longer. She also said that the experimental setup might
be less comfortable for the virus than a real-life setting.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For example, she said, the researchers used a relative humidity of 65
percent. “Many, but not all viruses, have shown that they survive worst
at this level of humidity,” she said. They do best at lower or much
higher humidity. The humidity in a heated house is less than 40 percent,
“at which the virus might survive even longer,” she said.

Mucus and respiratory fluids might also allow the virus to survive
longer than the laboratory fluids the researchers used for their
experiments.

Other experts said the paper’s findings illustrate the urgent need for
more information about the virus’s ability to survive in aerosols, and
under different conditions.

“We need more experiments like this, in particular, extending the
experimental sampling time for aerosolized virus beyond three hours and
testing survival under different temperature and humidity conditions,”
said Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, an environmental health sciences expert at
Columbia University.

Dr. Munster noted that, over all, the new coronavirus seems no more
capable of surviving for long periods than its close cousins SARS and
