WASHINGTON — In an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus and limit
its damage to the economy, congressional leaders and President Trump are
stitching together a new safety net for workers who contract the
coronavirus or lose their jobs because of it.

But compromises in the legislation set to pass the Senate this week have
ripped holes in that net, exposing millions of workers to financial
risks that could push them to continue reporting to work — even on the
front lines of the pandemic — and accelerate the infection rate
nationwide.

Democrats in Congress now say they will attempt to patch those holes by
expanding a government-funded paid-leave benefit and making unemployment
payments more generous for workers laid off as the economy rapidly
shutters under government orders seeking to curb the virus. But that
push will almost certainly have to wait for the next phase of the
congressional response, an increasingly expensive fight that could meet
resistance from business groups worried that the program could drive
small companies out of existence by allowing critical workers to stay at
home.

After a month of debate over the severity of the crisis, Mr. Trump and
lawmakers have in recent days largely coalesced around a strategy for
fighting the pandemic. It is based on the idea that the virus will not
spread as quickly if Americans largely stay home from work.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Economists say that executing that idea includes telling Americans to
work from home if they can and paying them not to go to the office if
they are sick or caring for children whose school is canceled. Ideally,
experts say, all but the most essential workers would stay home — and so
would everyone who is ill. The government should then compensate the
workers and businesses hurt by the ensuing economic slowdown.

“We need people to socially isolate and socially distance, and we need
people to stay home if they’re sick,” said Heather Boushey, the
president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning
think tank. “Our solutions need to be calibrated to the problem at
hand.”

So far, Ms. Boushey and others across the political spectrum say,
Congress’s efforts have fallen
short.

The House [passed a sweeping virus response
bill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-relief-congress.html)
early Saturday, but Democrats and the Trump administration continued to
negotiate through Monday over so-called technical corrections to a $100
billion program in the legislation. That program is meant to offer paid
leave to workers infected with the virus or otherwise hurt by it. The
negotiations narrowed the program, in part over the administration’s
concerns about burdening small businesses, despite objections from some
lawmakers and economists.

The changes passed the House late Monday evening, with few lawmakers
present or even able to read the legislation before it was approved. A
procedural maneuver allows legislation to be approved without the entire
chamber present so long as a single lawmaker does not object.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Under those changes, workers affected by the pandemic — as a result of
quarantine, caring for a family member, or closed schools and lack of
child care — receive two weeks of sick leave. Any paid leave provided
after that time is limited to workers with children whose school or
child care has been closed. The original legislation offered 10
additional weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay for all workers
affected by the pandemic.

The bill allows exemptions for workers in companies with more than 500
employees or fewer than 50. Under the amended version, health care
providers or emergency responders could be declared exempt from
receiving the additional paid leave by the Labor secretary, who is now
given the discretion to make that decision.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Ms. Boushey said she was alarmed by those changes. “I don’t want my
first responder to be sick,” she said, adding that the scope of benefits
in the bill for workers who lose their jobs amid the crisis was also
inadequate. She and other economists, like [Andrew Biggs of the
conservative American Enterprise
Institute](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbiggs/2020/03/17/boost-unemployment-benefits-to-fight-a-coronavirus-recession/#60e522d043ee),
say the government should effectively make up for the full lost wages of
workers who become unemployed, rather than partially doing so. Ms.
Boushey said lawmakers should also fully compensate workers whose hours
are reduced during the pandemic.

Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic
leader, say they will push for expansions of paid leave and unemployment
benefits in a new bill, in its early stages on Capitol Hill, that is
likely to include $1 trillion or more of economic stimulus, like direct
payments to workers.

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, introduced another
paid-leave bill on Tuesday along with other Democratic lawmakers, as
part of an effort to expand upon those provisions in a third coronavirus
relief package still under discussion.

“How do we make sure that people will stay home and not spread the
virus?” said Ms. Murray, whose state has been a center of the outbreak
in the United States. “Either we give people the means to stay home or
this will continue to
spread.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

In a sign that the debate defies traditional partisan lines, the
conservative group Heritage Action for America said on Tuesday that the
House’s paid-leave plan should be expanded to more workers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But business groups and their advocates continue to raise concerns about
the paid-leave efforts.

Some small business groups have opposed the plan. “The main thing I’ve
heard, and it’s almost been in unanimity among small business owners,”
said Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, “is that they don’t like
the structure, putting the onus out of the gate onto small business
owners.”

Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, who supports
the package put forward by the House, said that “there’s concerns about,
say, doctor’s offices and health care workers.”

“If the requirements are for paid sick leave, how are you going to move
that in with essential workers? I think that’s one thing,” she said.
“I’m sure there’s some questions on the mandate aspect of it, and
how it will actually work.”

“I think there was an admission in the room — and probably in the whole
building — that the bureaucracy of trying to figure the quickest and
easiest and less painful way to direct dollars to people always takes
longer than what people would think,” she added, speaking after a closed
lunch with Senate Republicans. “So I think that’s a source of concern
for everybody.”

Others raised concerns that workers would leave their jobs if the
program was too generous, jeopardizing business health.

“I don’t like the family leave setup,” said Senator Lindsey Graham,
Republican of South Carolina. “I think we should have gone through the
unemployment insurance route. We should have said to any company out

“My focus is not giving people a check from the government,” he told
reporters on Tuesday. “My focus is to make sure you get your paycheck
from your employer.
