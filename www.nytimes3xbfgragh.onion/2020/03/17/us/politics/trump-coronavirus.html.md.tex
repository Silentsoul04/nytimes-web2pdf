The president tried to rewrite his history with advising Americans about
the coronavirus. His own words prove him wrong.

WASHINGTON --- For weeks, President Trump has minimized
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/world/coronavirus-update-latest-news.html}{the
coronavirus}, mocked concern about it and treated the risk from it
cavalierly. On Tuesday he took to the White House lectern and made a
remarkable assertion: He knew it was a pandemic all along.

``This is a pandemic,'' Mr. Trump told reporters. ``I felt it was a
pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.''

This is what Mr. Trump has actually said over the past two months:

On Jan. 22, asked by a CNBC reporter whether there were ``worries about
a pandemic,'' the president replied: ``No, not at all. We have it
totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have
it under control. It's going to be just fine.''

On Feb. 26, at a White House news conference, commenting on the
country's first reported cases: ``We're going to be pretty soon at only
five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next
short period of time. So we've had very good luck.''

On Feb. 27, at a White House meeting: ``It's going to disappear. One day
--- it's like a miracle --- it will disappear.''

On March 7, standing next to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil at
Mar-a-Lago, his club in Palm Beach, Fla., when asked if he was concerned
that the virus was spreading closer to Washington: ``No, I'm not
concerned at all. No, I'm not. No, we've done a great job.'' (At least
three members of the Brazilian delegation and one Trump donor
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mar-a-lago.html}{at
Mar-a-Lago that weekend} later tested positive for the virus.)

On March 16, in the White House briefing room, warning that the outbreak
would ``wash'' away this summer: ``So it could be right in that period
of time where it, I say, wash --- it washes through. Other people don't
like that term. But where it washes through.''

That comment on Monday was part of Mr. Trump's inching toward a more
urgent tone in recent days. But his assertion on Tuesday that he had
long seen the pandemic coming was the most abrupt pivot yet from the
voluminous number of claims and caustic remarks he has made about the
disease.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump spent much of a lengthy news conference praising
his administration's response to the pandemic, saying the only mistake
his administration made had been a mismanagement of relationships with
the news media.

When asked why he had suddenly adopted a somber and realistic tone about
the virus on Tuesday, the president denied that he had changed his mind
at all.

``No, I've always viewed it as very serious,'' Mr. Trump said. ``There
was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is
similar, but some people said it wasn't.''

Besides denying the seriousness of the coronavirus over the past two
months, he had also displayed an acerbic tone toward people who took it
more seriously.

During a campaign rally in South Carolina on Feb. 28, Mr. Trump accused
Democrats and the news media of hysteria and unfairly criticizing his
administration by engaging in what he said was a political ``hoax.''
Some of his critics have stretched his comment to suggest that he was
calling the virus itself a hoax, but his **** supporters have argued
that he was referring to the Democratic criticism, not the virus itself.

And until recently, he and several of his advisers had privately mocked
his health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, as alarmist.

Another theme has been the president's offering inaccurate information.

At a campaign rally on Feb. 10, Mr. Trump suggested that the virus would
be gone by April, a claim he has frequently repeated, even though his
advisers had warned him that much about the virus was still not known.

As his administration came under intense criticism for a lack of urgency
in issuing guidance to Americans or expediting tests for the virus, Mr.
Trump continued misrepresenting what was available.

``Anybody right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a
test,''
\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-tour-centers-disease-control-prevention-atlanta-ga/}{the
president said} on March 6 during a tour of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ``They're there. They have the tests
and the tests are beautiful.''

During that visit, Mr. Trump praised his own ``natural ability'' to
grasp scientific theories, and then he likened the quality of the test
to a White House recounting of a phone call. ``The transcription was
perfect, right?'' he asked reporters. ``This was not as perfect as that,
but pretty good.''

While his administration struggled to form a uniform answer about
testing, Mr. Trump also made misleading claims about whether there would
be a vaccine for the virus.

On Feb. 29, the president said a vaccine would be available ``very
quickly'' and ``very rapidly,'' as he praised his administration's
actions as ``the most aggressive taken by any country.'' His statement
about how long it would take for a vaccine to be publicly available
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/08/health/fauci-coronavirus.html}{was
corrected} by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a member of the coronavirus task
force, in front of reporters.

This week, Mr. Trump announced that a vaccine candidate was entering a
clinical trial --- only the first phase in a lengthy process to find a
preventive measure.
