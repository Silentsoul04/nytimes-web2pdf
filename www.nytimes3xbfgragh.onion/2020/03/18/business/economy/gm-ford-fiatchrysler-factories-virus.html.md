# Automakers to Close Factories in North America

G.M., Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler were under pressure from the

With fear of infection rising among factory workers, and few customers
shopping for cars, several automakers on Wednesday decided to idle their
plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico for at least a week. The
decisions will put tens of thousands of people out of work and add to
the coronavirus outbreak’s growing economic toll.

The country’s largest automakers — General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat
Chrysler — decided to close plants after the United Auto Workers union
pressured them to do so to protect workers. That pressure intensified
after it was revealed on Wednesday that a worker at a Ford truck plant
in Dearborn, Mich., had tested positive for the virus.

In addition to G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Toyota and Nissan
also said they would idle their North American factories. The shutdown
of car plants will force hundreds of companies that produce parts and
components to follow suit over the coming days.

“This is another big blow to the economy,” said Patrick Anderson,
president of Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing, Mich.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Although some autoworkers will be eligible for sick pay, many will get
only a portion of their income and others will have to rely on
unemployment insurance.

“This is going to mean a significant loss in income,” Mr. Anderson said.
“Workers are really going to be hurt if there’s not some kind of
sustained program to help them.”

Ford, which has 55,000 U.A.W. employees, said those with at least one
year of service would receive 75 percent of their regular pay through a
combination of unemployment benefits and supplements paid by the
company. G.M. is discussing a similar plan with the U.A.W., a company
spokesman
said.

Ford[said in a statement that it would shut down
factories](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/03/18/ford-reduces-north-america-production-to-help-keep-workforce-saf.html)
after the end of Thursday evening shifts. G.M. said it would stagger
plant closings to “ensure that production stops in a safe and orderly
fashion.” Fiat Chrysler said it would begin shutting down production on
Wednesday. All three companies said they would idle their plants until
at least March 30. G.M. employs 47,000 U.A.W. members and Fiat Chrysler
49,000.

Earlier on Wednesday, Honda said it would close its plants for six days
beginning March 23, with plans to restart production on March 31. It
said it would provide full pay for the 27,000 employees in North America
affected by the decision. Nissan told its dealers it will shut down its
North America plants Friday and keep them idle until at least early
April.

More than one million people are employed in automobile and auto parts
manufacturing in the United States, and 1.3 million work for auto
dealerships, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“We have been taking extraordinary precautions around the world to keep
our plant environments safe and recent developments in North America
make it clear this is the right thing to do now,” G.M.’s chief
executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a statement.

The company also said sales had been slowing, a trend it expects to
continue as more people confine themselves to their homes to avoid
contracting or spreading the virus.

Some auto dealers said their showroom traffic fell sharply starting on
Tuesday. “We had four customers cancel deliveries because of the virus,”
said Wes Lutz, owner of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Mich., about 80 miles
west of Detroit. “They are afraid they will lose their jobs.”

Mr. Lutz and other dealers said customers were still bringing cars in
for maintenance and repairs, but the dealers are worried that service
visits could drop off soon as social distancing sharply reduces the
number of miles people normally drive.

“If you don’t leave the house, your car isn’t going to need an oil
change for a while,” said Adam Silverleib, owner of Silko Honda in
Raynham, Mass.

Automakers went into the week hoping to keep their plants running and
employees safe by altering shift schedules to leave more time for
sanitizing plants and reducing contact between workers. On Monday,
G.M.’s Chevrolet division began offering zero-percent loans to lure
consumers into dealerships. Hyundai offered to let customers return
recently purchased cars if had they lost their jobs.

At the same time the U.A.W. was pressing the three companies based in
and around Detroit to halt production for two weeks. On Tuesday G.M.,
Ford and Fiat Chrysler agreed to take steps short of shutting down
production.

Then on Wednesday morning Honda announced its plans to stop production,
and the news about the Ford worker in Dearborn was made public. In
response, Ford halted work at the final assembly section of the plant
while continuing production in the stamping and body shop areas.

Just hours later, all three of the large U.S. automakers reversed course
and said they would idle their factories.

In Europe, auto manufacturing has been at a virtual standstill after
Daimler, Ford Motor and Nissan joined Volkswagen and most other major
carmakers in shutting down.

In California, Tesla, the luxury electric carmaker, has cut staffing at
its Fremont factory from 10,000 to about 2,500 after local officials
issued a shelter-in-place order, according to Ray Kelly, a spokesman for
Alameda County.

Under the order, nonessential businesses like Tesla are permitted to
continue “minimum basic operations” as long as employees do their best
to stay at least six feet away from one another, [according to the
county](http://www.acphd.org/media/559828/faqs-order-shelter-in-place-20200316.pdf).

“Spirit of the law goes a long way,” Mr. Kelly said. “We’re doing things
that we would never do before.” Tesla may very well reduce its work
force further, he said, based on a conversation Wednesday with a senior
Tesla executive. The automaker did not respond to a request for comment
and its chief executive, Elon Musk, [has criticized the public reaction
to the
outbreak](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1239756900255903744) on
Twitter.
