The late-night announcement was the latest step by the central bank to
keep financial markets functioning during the coronavirus crisis.

WASHINGTON --- The Federal Reserve said late Wednesday night that it
would offer emergency loans to money market mutual funds, its latest in
a series of steps to keep the financial system functioning and prop up
the economy as it spirals toward recession during the coronavirus
pandemic.

The Fed
\href{https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200318a.htm}{said
in a release} that it would establish a so-called Money Market Mutual
Fund Liquidity Facility, which would be backed by \$10 billion from the
Treasury Department. That program joins a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/business/economy/federal-reserve-coronavirus.html}{similar
lending one for banks}, established this week.

The Fed is trying to protect the financial system and insulate the
broader economy, for which short-term pain could turn into long-term
suffering if credit crunches prevent companies from getting the cash
they need to function, forcing them to lay off workers, delay payments
to vendors and shutter plants.

Companies and investors are already seeing the chilling effects on
economic activity from the virus, as well as from the government
mandates that have tried to slow its spread. Sectors like tourism,
travel, retail and dining have shut down or slowed significantly in
large patches of the country, forcing Congress and the Trump
administration to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/business/bailout-economy-coronavirus.html}{contemplate
aid to workers and bailouts} for businesses on an unprecedented scale.

Money market mutual funds are the vehicles that millions of Americans
use to save money that can be readily tapped. Their total value is
\href{https://ici.org/research/stats/mmf/mm_03_12_20}{about \$3.8
trillion,} according to the latest data from the Investment Company
Institute.

With its move late Wednesday, the Fed was trying to prevent a recurrence
of events that happened in September 2008, when a major money market
fund,
\href{https://dealbook.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/17/money-market-fund-says-customers-could-lose-money/}{the
Reserve Primary Fund}, suffered huge losses on short-term Lehman
Brothers debt and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/18/business/yourmoney/18money.html}{``broke
the buck,''} meaning its value fell below the customary \$1 per share.

That event, shortly after
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html}{Lehman
Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection}, accelerated the freeze-up of
credit across the economy and deepened the financial crisis.

This week, the Fed reintroduced a program to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/business/economy/federal-reserve-coronavirus.html}{support
the commercial paper market}, short-term debt that large companies use
to finance their operations. The support for money markets is the flip
side of that program; money market funds invest in commercial paper.

That program is intended to ensure companies can keep getting the
dollars they need to operate, while the new program is focused on
ensuring investors in money market funds can be confident their money is
safe.

It is the latest in a series of steps that amount to recreating the
Fed's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. The central bank
has, since Sunday, also
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/business/economy/federal-reserve-coronavirus.html}{moved
its main interest rate target} to near-zero, reopened a program of
buying vast sums of bonds and encouraged banks to use emergency loans.
