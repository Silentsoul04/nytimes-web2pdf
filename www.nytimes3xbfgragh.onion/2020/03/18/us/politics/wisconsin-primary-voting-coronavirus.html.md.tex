\section{Democrats Sue Wisconsin Officials to Extend Deadlines for Early
Voting}\label{democrats-sue-wisconsin-officials-to-extend-deadlines-for-early-voting}}

The state Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee sued
elections officials to extend voting deadlines ahead of Wisconsin's
April 7 primary because of the coronavirus crisis.

The Wisconsin Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee on
Wednesday sued Wisconsin elections officials, demanding that the
deadline for online voter registration and vote by mail applications be
extended beyond midnight on Wednesday.

The lawsuit came as states around the country are scrambling to safely
hold primary elections during the coronavirus outbreak. Five states so
far have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html}{postponed
their primaries}, and Wyoming has canceled its in-person caucuses,
opting to conduct its presidential nominating contest wholly by mail.

But the Wisconsin primary,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/us/elections/2020-presidential-election-calendar.html}{scheduled
for April 7}, includes numerous state, local and municipal elections
that would be more difficult to reschedule than just a presidential
primary, because some involve a transfer of executive power. There is
also an election for a State Supreme Court justice.

Wisconsin's elections are governed by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections
Commission, which operates separately from the governor.

The lawsuit calls for a new deadline of April 3 for electronic and
by-mail registration.

The suit is also seeking to drop a requirement that voters provide photo
identification when requesting absentee ballots, and to allow any
absentee or vote by mail ballot postmarked by April 7 to be valid for
the election.

Calls for vote by mail have increased among Democrats. Late Tuesday, Tom
Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called on all
remaining states on the primary calendar to explore different methods of
voting to help decrease any health risk to voters during
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/world/coronavirus-news.html}{the
coronavirus outbreak}.

``The D.N.C. is urging the remaining primary states to use a variety of
other critical mechanisms that will make voting easier and safer for
voters and election officials alike,'' Mr. Perez said in a statement.
``The simplest tool is vote by mail, which is already in use in a number
of states and should be made available to all registered voters.''

Expansive vote by mail and early voting helped
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/us/politics/march-17-democratic-primary.html}{lift
turnout in Arizona's and Florida's primaries} on Tuesday above 2016
levels, buoyed in large part by the availability of early voting and a
push from local authorities to encourage voters to cast ballots early.

In Wisconsin, the state Democratic Party said it had shifted its entire
organizing apparatus to a digital campaign during the coronavirus
outbreak. Part of that includes a huge digital canvassing effort through
emails, text messages and social media posts to persuade voters to
register online and request a vote by mail or absentee ballot.

``Nobody should have to choose between exposure to COVID-19 and
disenfranchisement,'' Ben Wikler, the chair of the state Democratic
Party, said in a statement. ``The court should immediately strike down
the barriers to full participation in voting by mail. Our democracy
depends on our ability to conduct free, safe, and fair elections, no
matter what --- even during a pandemic.''
