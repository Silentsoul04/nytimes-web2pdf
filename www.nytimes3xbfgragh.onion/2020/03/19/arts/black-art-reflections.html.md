I grew up in Southern California neighborhoods that were overwhelmingly
white — white schools, white teachers, white curriculum. I remember
visiting the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where a cast of [Auguste
Rodin’s monumental sculpture of
Balzac](https://collections.lacma.org/node/251434) towered over me. My
friends and I immersed ourselves in the works of white authors, and I
can still recite vast sections of T.S. Eliot’s “The Hollow Men,” William
Butler Yeats’s “The Second Coming,” and, if I squeeze my eyes real
tight, the final luxurious paragraphs of “The Dead,” James Joyce’s
masterful short story.

But I am black — African-American, if you will — and unambiguously of
African heritage. Thanks to my father, the rhythms and melodies of
Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and John Coltrane flowed
through our household during my childhood. Yet, as an adolescent, Led
Zeppelin, Cream and the Who were favored by my friends and me. (My
enthusiasm for bluesmen such as Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Howlin’
Wolf and Muddy Waters was rooted in my rock ’n’ roll fandom.) In short,
I felt only incidentally “black,” despite being harassed by the local
police, who frequently stopped me as I walked home from school or rode
my bike to the grocery store.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That feeling slowly changed, of course, as I became an adult. But I
didn’t feel I became fully black until the birth of my first child.
His arrival brought into focus the usual parental responsibilities of
providing food, shelter and moral support. But I also felt a special
duty to imbue my son — and later my daughter — with a sense of what it
means to be of African heritage in America. Not “the talk” about
navigating encounters with the police. I felt the need to address
meta-questions pertaining to the frame of mind that would help my
children prosper in the world, not only survive.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So, I [wrote a
cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Fruits-Harvest-Recipes-Celebrate-Holidays-ebook/dp/B003YCOP98)
whose recipes from the African diaspora were anchored by stories from
the black cooks who contributed them, as well as the wit and wisdom from
black cultures around the world and across time. Then came [a series of
what I call “affirmative action”
books](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Pearls-Affirmations-Inspirations-African-Americans/dp/0688122914)
— collections of pithy proverbs and quotes from prominent historical and
contemporary black people meant to inspire the desire to implement
concrete positive action.

More recently, my thoughts turned to internalizing black culture in a
more formal way, especially after seeing Jacob Lawrence’s “The Migration
Series” at the Museum of Modern Art in 2015. The 60 small panel
paintings [illustrating the movement of black Southerners to the
North](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/v/lawrence-migration-series)
had affected me tremendously. The formal beauty of the work and the
message of black agency felt like an oasis of pride and inspiration in a
world of stop and frisks, police killings of black men and women, and
the general denigration of “black culture.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then, in 2018, there was “Black Panther,” [the first major superhero
movie with an African
protagonist](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/12/movies/black-panther-marvel-chadwick-boseman-ryan-coogler-lupita-nyongo.html);
[Beyoncé’s Coachella
performance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/15/arts/music/beyonce-coachella-review.html),
during which she presented over a century of black musical traditions;
and, performing as Childish Gambino, Donald Glover’s violent, darkly
comic video, [“This Is
America.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY) These works
seemed to amount to encyclopedias of black cultural touchstones,
resources of strength in racially fraught times.

I began to wonder: What particular pieces of music, film, sculpture,
dance or other artistic expression do some of today’s best and brightest
black creators find important? What aspects of the kaleidoscopic
collective black soul as expressed in the arts would they want to
emphasize and remember 25 or 50 years from now? Should such a list
include Public Enemy’s 1990 album “Fear of a Black Planet”? The “Wade in
the Water” segment of[Alvin Ailey’s
“Revelations”](http://pressroom.alvinailey.org/file/wade-in-the-water-from-alvin-ailey-s-revelations?action=)?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That’s a lot to bite off when talking about centuries of global black
artistic expression, but what about narrowing it to black arts created
over these first two decades of the 21st century? Shifts in politics,
performance and protest have all altered our culture in a way not seen
in years. The beauty of this exercise in reflection is not only to
celebrate black cultural contributions to art but also record a pivotal
time for our country — indeed the world. It’s a starting place for
further exploration for my 18-month-old granddaughter and many future
generations after hers.

To play on the words, but not the meaning, of John Milton’s “Paradise
Lost”: Such a survey would be the latest hopeful sally to make darkness
not just visible, but aspirational. Works that bear witness to what
black people went through and still endure; works that reveal past and
continuing struggles and successes.
