36 Hours \ldots{} in Wherever You Are here.}}}

It's a strange time for everyone. For us at New York Times Travel, we're
asking many existential questions, among them: How do we talk about
travel when it's grinding to a halt?

So we're asking you to join us in a special experiment. For nearly two
decades, we've published our weekly
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/36-hours}{36 Hours
column}, guiding our readers with packed itineraries for weekends in
cities all over the globe.

While traveling for fun is not an option now, we're inspired by the
enduring spirit of discovery, curiosity and creativity.

And that's where you come in. We'd like to create a special \textbf{``36
Hours in Wherever You Are''} --- the first reader-generated column in
its long history.

\textbf{In the form below, write 50 words or so about one thing your
fellow Travel readers can do over a weekend wherever they are, and why
you're suggesting it}.

Think within the spirit of travel, even if many of us are housebound. It
might be:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An album or a song playlist
\item
  A book or movie that transports you
\item
  A particular recipe you love
\item
  A podcast episode worth sharing
\item
  A drawing exercise
\item
  A religious or spiritual ritual, or a service to take part in
\item
  Taking a walk around your neighborhood
\item
  Ways to ``travel'' without traveling
\item
  A clever way to virtually connect with family and friends
\end{itemize}

We will use your single-activity suggestions and compile them into a
weekend itinerary, built for and by our readers. Thanks for taking part!
