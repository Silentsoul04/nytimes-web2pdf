# Senate Rescue Package Includes Corporate Tax Cuts and $1,200 Checks

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — The White House and lawmakers scrambled on Thursday to
flesh out details of a $1 trillion economic stabilization plan to help
workers and businesses weather a potentially deep recession, negotiating
over the size and scope of direct payments to millions of people and aid
for companies facing devastation in the coronavirus pandemic.

Senate Republicans, racing to put their imprint on the crisis response,
unveiled a package that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in
loans to big corporations and small businesses, large corporate tax cuts
and checks of up to $1,200 for taxpayers. The plan would also place
limits on a paid-leave program enacted this week to respond to the
crisis.

But the 247-page measure, the product of a feverish round of
negotiations among Republicans, was all but certain to face opposition
from Democrats who have pressed for more generous paid-leave benefits
and targeting help to workers and families rather than large
corporations.

The details emerged as Washington grappled with the dimensions of an
extraordinary government rescue effort that is likely to last for many
months. At the White House, President Trump said he would be open to
having the government take equity stakes in companies that require
federal help, a move that would be unpopular with shareholders and would
give the government more oversight over businesses.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But he also injected new uncertainty into the government’s response,
suggesting it was not his responsibility to meet the needs of health
care workers on the front lines of combating the disease. A day after he
said he would use the [Defense Production
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/28/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html)
— a Korean War-era law that allows presidents to force American industry
to ramp up production of critical equipment and supplies — Mr. Trump
told reporters that he would rather rely on states to deliver equipment
to health care workers.

“The federal government’s not supposed to be out there buying vast
amounts of items and then shipping,” Mr. Trump said. “You know, we’re
not a shipping clerk,” he said, adding that governors “are supposed to
be doing it.”

On Capitol Hill, Republicans presented a bill that would offer bridge
loans of up to $10 million each to small businesses, extend hundreds of
billions of dollars in loans to large corporations in distressed
industries and send checks as large as $1,200 per adult to individuals
earning less than $99,000 per year. The payments would phase in for
earners up to $75,000 — meaning lower earners would get smaller checks —
and then phase out again at $99,000. Those who did not earn enough to
pay income tax would receive much less: $600.

The proposal is different from one pitched on Thursday by Steven
Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who said the administration wanted to
send two waves of $1,000 checks to every American, one in April and one
in May should the crisis persist.

The Senate bill also includes a raft of temporary changes to the tax
code that would reduce the tax liability of large corporations, many of
them overriding provisions in the 2017 tax overhaul that were meant to
raise revenue to offset corporate rate cuts.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It would place new limits on a paid-leave program that Congress passed
and Mr. Trump signed into law this week, shielding small business owners
from any costs of paid leave for workers affected by the virus — and
limiting how much pay those workers could receive if they are forced to
stay
home.

A preliminary estimate by the Tax Foundation in Washington shows that
the bill would cost at least $1 trillion. The small-business loans alone
would be $300 billion, according to documents circulated on Thursday by
Senate Republicans.

Mr. McConnell called for negotiations to begin with Senate Democrats on
Friday, adding that Mr. Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, the director of the
National Economic Council, and Eric M. Ueland, the administration’s
director of legislative affairs, would join them on behalf of the
administration.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But little more than an hour after its release, the top House and Senate
Democrats indicated that the legislation did not meet their standards.

“We are beginning to review Senator McConnell’s proposal, and on first
reading, it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way
ahead of workers,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New
York, the minority leader, said in a joint statement.

Calling the legislation a “significant next step,” Mr. McConnell vowed
that the Senate would not leave until the rescue package had been
approved, and said there could be a possible fourth relief package to
follow as Congress seeks to address an extraordinary series of events.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But several of the Republican proposals are likely to be nonstarters for
Democrats in both chambers, whose support is needed in order for the
package to become law.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“Hopefully each side will give,” said Mr. Schumer of New York, the
minority leader, speaking minutes after Mr. McConnell introduced the
proposal. “We’ll come up with a good plan, we’ll send it to the
president, and we will help to begin the long path to eradicate this
awful virus.”

House Democrats, scattered across the country during an indefinite
recess, have also been exchanging their own proposals over conference
calls from their districts. Ms. Pelosi, who has spoken repeatedly with
Mr. Mnuchin in recent days, has said her committee leaders were
discussing the possibility of expanding unemployment insurance
eligibility, refundable tax credits and funds for small businesses to
ensure that workers continue to be paid.

One of the sticking points for members of both parties was the scope of
the direct payment program, with some Republican senators pushing to
strengthen unemployment insurance and loans for small businesses.

“Direct payments make sense when the economy is beginning to restart —
it makes no sense now because it’s just money,” Senator Lindsey Graham,
Republican of South Carolina, told reporters. “What I want is income,
not one check. I want you to get a check you can count on every week,
not one week.”

Others said it should be structured so that the lowest earners got the
most help — not the other way around.

“Relief to families in this emergency shouldn’t be regressive,” Senator
Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said in a
[tweet](https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1240769223267356673).
“Lower-income families shouldn’t be penalized.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While there is general agreement about the need to speed economic help
to millions of Americans, House Democrats are also debating the contours
of their own proposal, including how to target the direct payments and
the level of government intervention. During a private conference call
on Thursday, they debated where to set the income cap on individuals who
could receive government checks, according to three people familiar with
the discussion who insisted on anonymity to describe the private call.

Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee, which would have some jurisdiction over
the issue, suggested capping the direct payments to individuals with
incomes between $50,000 and $75,000, according to two people familiar
with the discussion. Other lawmakers advocated raising the limit to
individual incomes of $130,000, while others suggested universal
payments.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Ms. Pelosi has said publicly and privately that she will consider
including provisions that would expand eligibility for unemployment
insurance, as well as using refundable tax credits to expedite funds
directly toward people affected by the outbreak.

It is also likely that the House will address a request from the
administration to distribute emergency aid to agencies on the front
lines. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the Democratic
chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, told her colleagues on
Thursday that her committee is expected to allocate between $100 billion
and $150 billion, more than doubling the request, according to a person
familiar with the remarks, and include it in the emerging package.

“Supplemental appropriations are an essential part of a
whole-of-government strategy to address this pandemic, and it is
irresponsible for Senate Republican leadership to omit these needed
resources from its proposal,” said Evan Hollander, a spokesman for the
House committee.

Earlier this month, Congress [approved a first, $8.3 billion
round](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/04/us/politics/coronavirus-emergency-aid-congress.html)
of emergency money for federal health agencies, and this week it
finalized a second measure — whose cost has yet to be tallied — to
provide paid leave, jobless aid and food and health care assistance, as
well as free coronavirus testing. Mr. Trump has signed both.

Time is of the essence in the talks. The news Wednesday night that two
House lawmakers had tested positive for coronavirus after voting early
Saturday has added pressure for senators to cut a swift deal on the
package and depart Washington indefinitely.

The fiscal relief package unveiled Thursday is only one part of the
administration’s plan, which some analysts now anticipate topping $1.5
trillion before the negotiations are completed. Mr. Mnuchin said the
Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve were working in lock step
and were prepared to do whatever was possible to provide liquidity to
American companies so they could weather the crisis without laying off
workers. The Federal Reserve said late Wednesday night that it would
[offer emergency
loans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/business/federal-reserve-mutual-funds-coronavirus-aid.html)
to money market mutual funds, its latest in a series of steps to keep
the financial system functioning and prop up the economy.

“What we’re really focused on is providing liquidity to American
businesses and American workers,” Mr. Mnuchin said on the Fox Business
Network on Thursday. “This is an unprecedented situation.”

He said he had advised the president to purchase oil, which is at
historically low prices, and fill up America’s strategic reserve.

Economists are bracing for a deep recession. Analysts at J.P. Morgan
said this week that the United States economy could contract by 14
percent in the second quarter of this year.

The Treasury Department has not released updated economic projections,
but Mr. Mnuchin said that he expected the beginnings of growth again in
the third quarter and a “gigantic” rebound in the final three months of
the year.

Economic data is beginning to trickle out, offering a grim preview of
the damage that lies ahead. Official figures released on Thursday showed
claims for unemployment insurance reaching their highest level in more
than two years.

“The coronavirus outbreak is already starting to have a significant
impact on the economy,” said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at
Capital Economics. “Timelier reports of state-level data point to an
unprecedented surge in layoffs over the next couple of weeks.”

The Treasury secretary indicated that he and the Federal Reserve chair,
Jerome H. Powell, would use all the tools at their disposal to allow
that workers and businesses to subsist for the next few months.

Edmondson and Katie Rogers.
