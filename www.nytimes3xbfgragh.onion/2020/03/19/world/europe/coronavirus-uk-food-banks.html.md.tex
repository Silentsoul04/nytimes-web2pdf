Donations}\label{its-very-scary-uk-food-banks-close-as-coronavirus-stalls-donations}}

Panic and hoarding because of the pandemic, coupled with a looming
recession, have paralyzed groups that provide food for people in need.

LONDON --- As panicked shoppers in Britain empty supermarket shelves and
hoard goods amid
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html}{the
coronavirus outbreak}, food banks that depend on donations are
struggling to stay afloat, and some have been forced to shut down.

Vulnerable families who depend on emergency food packages to survive
received limited supplies this week as food banks across Britain fell
short on items like pasta, tinned vegetables, long-life milk, baby food,
diapers and toilet paper. And the winter months, when people in crisis
are less likely to meet the basic costs of living, are particularly
critical.

``It's very scary, because everyone is walking around with bags and
trolleys full of food stocking up for the next few months, while I'm
worrying about whether I have enough food to feed the children this
week,'' said Angie Fowler, a mother of three who depends on the Chalk
Farm food bank in northern London. ``If this place closes down, I don't
know what we'll do. We have no backup.''

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/world/europe/britain-coronavirus-boris-johnson.html}{Even
before the coronavirus outbreak,} food banks in the country were
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/30/sports/britain-premier-league-foodbanks.html}{struggling
to meet demands} that have steadily increased in recent years. Last
year, the Trussell Trust, Britain's largest network of food banks,
delivered 1.6 million three-day emergency food supplies to people in
crisis --- an 18.8 percent increase on the previous year.

``It is possible that food banks will face increased demand as people
lose income, at the same time as food donations drop or staff and
volunteers are unavailable, due to measures rightly put in place to slow
the spread of infection,'' said Emma Revie, the Trussell Trust's chief
executive.

Johnson, U.K. Prime Minister, has the coronavirus}}\emph{.{]}}

``All of this comes when food banks are already dealing with a record
level of need for emergency food,'' she said. ``We're working with our
network on how best to support people as the situation unfolds.''

The Islington food bank in northern London said on Monday that it would
shut down next week because of a decline in donations and volunteer
staff. Other food banks have been reducing their services.

The North Paddington food bank in western London, which provides food to
more than 100 households each week, said its donations were down 25
percent. On Wednesday, volunteers handed out pre-prepared packages and
limited the time people spent on the premises.

``We are just focusing on keeping people safe and ensuring they have
enough to eat through this crisis,'' said James Quayle, the food bank's
manager. ``Right now, we are working hard to maintain our own supply
chain as donations have become less reliable.''

Mr. Quayle said he was surprised by how calm people at the food bank
have been in the onset of the outbreak, especially when compared with
the panicked shoppers in the supermarkets. ``No one is asking for
extra,'' he said.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/03/19/world/19virus-ukfoodbanks2/merlin_170528835_25a82c79-d6ee-4613-8719-11bb7243f0e6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Most food banks anticipate having to deliver more food packages in the
coming weeks as people go into self-isolation, an increase that will
require additional staff and resources.

The Sufra food bank, which serves a large number of refugees and asylum
seekers, has canceled most of its services. Instead it is providing
limited food parcels, and a lack of supplies is forcing most recipients
to closely ration their packages.

``All the indications are that the U.K. is on the precipice of a
recession, which will mean that financial donations to the charity will
also start drying up while demand for food aid rises,'' said Rajesh
Makwana, the food bank's director. ``Add to this the impact of austerity
and universal credit, and you can see why this really is the perfect
storm.''

Britain's biggest supermarket chains, including Asda, Tesco and
Sainsbury's, introduced restrictions on purchases on Wednesday after
shopping aisles were stripped bare within hours of some stores' opening.
They will also reserve the first hour after opening to older people and
vulnerable people to ensure them access to essential supplies.

Adam Connell, a volunteer who has been delivering packages to seniors
and other vulnerable people in recent weeks, fears that the outbreak
will push struggling people deeper into poverty and social exclusion.
Around 14 million people live in poverty in Britain --- about one-fifth
of the overall population --- according to the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation, an independent social change organization.

The loss of food banks carries implications far beyond the distribution
of food, executives say.

``Foodbanks don't just provide food~--- they provide a support network
and a social platform for people who would otherwise feel alone and
excluded,'' Mr. Connell said. ``If the spread of the virus gets to a
point of crisis like we've seen in Italy, I'm not sure how we will be
able to continue providing these services.''

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/world/europe/EU-closes-borders-virus.html}{Schools
will close starting on Friday} throughout Britain, and many parents
worry about the added pressures of providing lunches for their children
without the help of food banks and other social services.

``It's already difficult to feed the children during the school
holidays,'' Ms. Fowler said. ``If the schools stay shut and we're stuck
at home all day, I'm not sure how we'll manage.''

``I'm already dealing with depression and anxiety,'' she said. ``I can't
deal with this.''
