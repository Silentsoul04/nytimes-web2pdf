WASHINGTON — President Trump issued an [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-prioritizing-allocating-health-medical-resources-respond-spread-covid-19/)
this week invoking the [Defense Production
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/coronavirus-defense-production-act.html)
to battle the coronavirus pandemic, but his advisers have [resisted
making aggressive use of the
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-supplies.html)
to mobilize private industry.

Mr. Trump has [given mixed
signals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-supplies.html)
about whether his administration has actually used the law at all to
spur the production of scarce and necessary items like ventilators;
testing kits; and protective masks, gloves, and gowns.

Here is an explanation of the law.

## What is the Defense Production Act?

It is a law that permits the federal government to impose some control
over private-sector industry to ensure the production of material that
is deemed necessary for national defense. It traces back to the Korean
War.

Congress enacted it with military necessities like steel and tanks in
mind, but lawmakers expanded it after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to
cover other areas, including public health and safety. It was
reauthorized last year until 2025.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Notably, an existing government panel created under the law, the Defense
Production Act Committee — made up of officials from various agencies —
already has a process and a system in place to implement it.

“If I were advising the president, I would say, ‘Mr. President you have
a lot more tools available under the D.P.A. than are being used.
Moreover, some of the tools have lead times,’” said Jamie E. Baker, a
former legal adviser to the National Security Council and a professor of
national security law at Syracuse University.

He added: “And, if these tools are being used, then the government
should be more transparent in their use so that the public and our first
responders are aware that help is on the
way.”

## How could the law force companies to prioritize making certain items?

One part of the law permits the government to alter the order in which
companies fulfill their contractual obligations by telling them to
prioritize some existing contracts ahead of others. For example, if a
company makes surgical masks and other paper products, the government
could tell it to put the other items on hold to free up production for
masks. The Pentagon routinely uses this authority with defense
contractors.

There is an open question about whether the government could use the law
to force a company to accept a new contract for a product that it does
not already make.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Convincing companies to set up new facilities from scratch may be
particularly difficult. Industry executives said it could take months
for factories to obtain the necessary equipment to begin production.
Much of the equipment used in American factories is now made offshore,
and the global shipping industry is in disarray.

## How could the law affect allocation of medical items?

The law gives the federal government the power to decide how scarce
material of national security importance is distributed. For example,
during a war, it could use that power to steer steel to a tank factory
over an automobile factory.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Mr. Baker said the federal government must consider making aggressive
use of this power to allocate ventilators and masks rolling off
production lines, so that they are distributed to where they are needed
most rather than risk states fighting for them in bidding wars.

“We do not want states competing with each other for the same mask,” Mr.
Baker said. “We want best public health practices to determine where
resources should flow and in what order.”

## How else could it help expand industrial production?

The government could already be incentivizing rapid changes to expand
production capacity and supply of necessary products.

[Title III of the Defense Production
Act](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1650-20490-5258/final__defense_production_act_091030.pdf)
consists of a collection of powers the government could use for this
purpose, including making guaranteed loans to help companies develop new
production capabilities of goods relevant to the crisis. The government
can also procure and install equipment in factories, including privately
owned ones.

The law lets the government spend $50 million out of a special fund for
this purpose before executive branch officials would need to ask
Congress for additional authority.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## What else could the government be doing?

It could be collecting information about factory equipment to figure out
which companies have the capacity to change their production lines and
make more needed items.

Under Section 705 of the Defense Production Act, the government can
gather information to make such assessments, wielding subpoena power and
criminal penalties if a company owner balks and says the information is
proprietary. The government could use this power to gather information
now that would put it in a position to identify which firms would have
the capacity to retool if necessary later.

## What has Trump done?

He has issued an [executive
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-prioritizing-allocating-health-medical-resources-respond-spread-covid-19/)
delegating the ability to invoke powers under the Defense Production Act
to Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, to
battle the coronavirus pandemic.

## Is that, by itself, extraordinary?

No. It is a minor bureaucratic thing to do. In 2016, President Barack
Obama had already delegated the ability to invoke the Defense Production
Act to several Cabinet secretaries, for example.

## Has the Trump administration actually used the law’s powers?

This is unclear.

The administration has not announced that Mr. Azar has ordered any
particular company to do any particular thing under the Defense
Production Act. And Mr. Trump [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1240391871026864130)
that, “I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese
Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the
future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this
TOGETHER\!”

On Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority
leader, said [he had urged Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-supplies.html)
in a phone call to actually use the Defense Production Act to get going
on producing more ventilators and other equipment needed to combat the
virus, and that Mr. Trump had yelled to someone in his office to do it
now.

Later that day, in a testy news conference, Mr. Trump claimed that he
had already used the law to spur production of “millions of masks.” But
Mr. Trump has a long history of saying things that have no basis in
fact, and no company has disclosed receiving any such order.
