Tim McGreevy has worked in the bean business for more than 30 years. But
when he scanned the bean aisles at a grocery store in Pullman, Wash., on
Sunday, he saw something he had never seen before: empty shelves.

“In one sense, this is like my best dream,” said Mr. McGreevy, who runs
a [trade
group](https://www.usapulses.org/membership/american-pulse-association)
for producers and packagers of pulses, a category of legumes that
includes beans. “In another sense, you go, ‘Wow, this is pretty
serious.’”

As the coronavirus pandemic upends daily life across the United States,
Americans are filling their pantries with long-lasting essentials —
pasta, rice, canned meat, [even oat
milk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/what-s-being-stockpiled-in-american-pandemic-pantry-oat-milk).

But amid all the panic shopping, the growing demand for beans has stood
out as an especially potent symbol of the anxious and uncertain times.
At supermarkets, shoppers are stocking up on canned beans from familiar
brands like [Goya
Foods](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/business/goya-boycott.html),
as well as thick bags of dry beans that usually lie largely untouched on
store shelves.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To some suppliers, the sudden popularity of their once-unfashionable
beans feels a little surreal.

“No one ever cares about beans at all,” said Steve Sando, who runs the
heirloom bean supplier Rancho Gordo in the Napa Valley. “It’s just
shocking. I used to be the loneliest man at the farmer’s market.”

In recent weeks, the buying frenzy has extended to the entire pulses
family, including lentils, dry peas and chickpeas as well as beans.
Across the industry, canners and packagers have seen a 40 percent
increase in sales, Mr. McGreevy
said.

At Goya, the increase has been even more dramatic: Sales of black beans,
pinto beans and other canned products have spiked as much as 400
percent. In the last week, Goya has delivered 24 million cans to
retailers.

“I’ve seen earthquakes and hurricanes. This is the first time I’ve seen
this,” said Bob Unanue, the company’s president. “This is a tsunami,
this is a hurricane that’s not hitting one market. It’s hitting all
markets.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Many canners and packagers are hiring staff or adding shifts to meet the
surge in demand. Typically, Rancho Gordo receives 150 to 200 orders a
day for its specialty beans. On March 14, the company received 1,669
orders. The next day, it recorded an additional 1,450. “We’re not set up
for this at all,” Mr. Sando said.

At his warehouse, Mr. Sando has instituted a night shift, hiring a
handful of workers from a temporary agency to help out. He has told
customers to expect delays as long as three or four weeks in fulfilling
orders. Some mornings, he said, he wakes up to find that the company has
already sold as many beans as it would normally sell in an entire
day.

“I’m taking no joy in this, to be honest,” Mr. Sando said. “It’s born
out of fear. I mean, I love the sales. But food should be something you
feel good about.”

In many ways, pulses are the perfect food for a time of mass anxiety.
They are cheap and nutritious. And some products can sit in a pantry for
as long as two years.

“They have found lentils in Egyptian tombs — and they’ve still
sprouted,” Mr. McGreevy said. “Now, I’m not recommending you consume
lentils from Egyptian times. But these are really shelf-stable foods.”

For years, however, beans of all varieties have gotten a bad rap. Some
people still associate them with the [Great
Depression](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/great-depression-eat/511355/).
The food and agriculture branch of the United Nations
[warns](http://www.fao.org/fao-stories/article/en/c/1126738/) that “many
kids hate the ‘mushy’ texture.” And an entire [children’s
book](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/dan-yaccarino/the-lima-bean-monster/)
has been devoted to the scourge of lima beans.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But beans were beginning to grow more popular even before the
coronavirus. Some environmentally conscious consumers are turning to
beans as an alterative to meat, and home cooks have increasingly
[embraced
them](https://www.eater.com/2019/12/12/20974754/dried-beans-trend-rancho-gordo-instant-pot).
After dipping in the early 2000s, the consumption of dry beans in the
United States has risen in recent years, to 9.6 pounds in 2018 from 7.2
pounds per capita in 2015, according to government estimates.

A few years ago, Mr. Sando started a “bean club” in which members could
receive special bean shipments every three months for a subscription
fee. It was meant to be a joke. “We’re in Napa, and I thought, ‘Oh, wine
club — let’s do a bean club,’” he said. Now it has a waiting list of
more than 8,000
names.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Twitter, bean aficionados have offered to help novice cooks figure
out how to prepare the legumes, sharing recipes and tips. “There are a
lot of new people who are kind of freaked out,” Mr. Sando said. “It’s
pretty easy. You cook them till they’re done.”

At the beginning of March, Luke Winkie, a freelance journalist in
Brooklyn, bought a few bags of dry beans. It seemed like a sensible
purchase. Only he had no idea what to do with them.

So he did a little online research. “It’s like a two-day process,” he
said. “It’s so far from the easy utilitarian thing I was expecting.” On
Monday, Mr. Winkie, 28, cooked some dry white beans, which he had
salvaged from a failed attempt the previous night to prepare a bean and
chicken dish. “The beans were not good,” said Rebecca Jennings, a
27-year-old journalist and Mr. Winkie’s girlfriend. “No one just eats a
bowl of beans.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Professional chefs have long appreciated beans for their versatility.
They can go in soups and salads. They pair well with chicken, lamb and
other meats. And they can be cooked intact or mashed
together.

“Drain them, mash them up, put olive oil in or butter, heat it up — it’s
delicious,” said Georgeanne Brennan, the author of the cookbook “French
Beans.” “It’s kind of a learning opportunity now with these people who
are hoarding the beans to have some pretty great new discoveries.”

Still, some people whose [“pandemic
pantries”](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/nielsen-investigation-pandemic-pantries-pressure-supply-chain-amidst-covid-19-fears/)
are overflowing with beans are not looking forward to actually eating
them. Lupita Medina, an 18-year-old from Utah, was surprised to see her
mother buy canned beans to prepare for the outbreak.

“I don’t think I have ever had them,” Ms. Medina said. “Hard pass.”
