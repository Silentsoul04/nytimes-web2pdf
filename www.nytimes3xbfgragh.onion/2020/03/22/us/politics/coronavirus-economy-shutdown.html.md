WASHINGTON — The American economy has stopped working.

We’re going to try turning it off and back on again.

With confirmed [cases of the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
escalating rapidly, government officials have almost overnight switched
off activity in large sectors of the United States. They want as few
people as possible in close contact with one another in order to slow
[the
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus),
which may be even more widespread than official statistics suggest.

The federal government has discouraged gatherings of 10 or more people.
[California told 40 million
residents](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/us/California-stay-at-home-order-virus.html)
to leave the house only for absolute necessities. Bars, shopping malls,
dine-in restaurants and a host of other businesses are closing across
the country. Millions of people have been [laid
off](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/business/economy/coronavirus-employers-unemployment.html),
or are about to be.

Just as there is a public health strategy driving the government orders
closing businesses and limiting daily activity outside the home, there
is also an economic strategy for putting large parts of the economy on
ice. It requires aggressive action by the federal government, funded by
what would be the most expansive borrowing the country has seen since
World War II.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Whether the United States looks back at those job cuts as a quick blip
of prevention or a devastating spiral into an economic depression
depends a lot on what Congress and President Trump do in the next few
days.

Here’s what economists say needs to happen.

## Aim to put the ‘v’ in ‘recovery.’

The United States is already falling into a [sharp economic
contraction](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/21/business/economy/coronavirus-recession.html):
It is producing far fewer goods and services now than it did a month or
a quarter ago. That contraction will persist as long as [businesses are
unable to open and people are not able to
work](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/business/economy/coronavirus-economy-impact.html).
This is not happening because of any choices those workers or businesses
made; it’s a mandate from the government that has frozen a lot of
economic activity.

At some point — possibly when a vaccine for the virus comes to market,
or possibly as soon as the rate of infection starts declining and
widespread testing allows for more confidence that another surge is not
imminent — governments will lift their restrictions and activity will
start to thaw.

Ideally, it would thaw quickly, with shops and restaurants reopening,
workers rehired, factory production lines restarted and people spending
money on things they didn’t need or couldn’t buy during the freeze. In
that situation, the economy would grow much faster for a while than it
normally does, as consumers unleash their pent-up demand.

Economists call that a “V-shaped” recovery, because growth plunges and
then shoots up. It’s what they’re aiming for now, but it could be hard
to pull off.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“What a recession from something like this should look like is a sudden
stop and recovery,” said R. Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University
economist who was a top White House economist for President George W.
Bush. “What could happen, though, is a doom loop.”

## Extend companies a very large lifeline.

The “doom loop” that Mr. Hubbard and many other economists fear
describes a situation in which an even moderately protracted shutdown of
economic activity permanently kills waves of small businesses — and
possibly entire industries, like airlines — that cannot survive very
long without customers.

A typical small business in the United States does not have enough cash
on hand to cover even a month of expenses if its revenues are completely
disrupted, according to [research by the JPMorgan Chase
Institute](https://institute.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/institute/pdf/institute-growth-vitality-cash-flows.pdf).
In minority communities, where profit margins are often narrower, the
typical cash reserve is even
smaller.

Economists say that means Congress needs to act boldly, and fast, to
keep money flowing to business owners to ensure they can reopen when the
crisis abates.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

There are several possible ways to try to do that.

Steven Hamilton, an economist at George Washington University who has
been one of the loudest public voices calling for aggressive assistance
to small businesses, and Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise
Institute, [want banks to offer
loans](https://thedispatch.com/p/any-stimulus-plan-must-help-small) to
cover lost revenues for small businesses — and for the federal
government to forgive the loans if the companies don’t lay off workers.
Mr. Hubbard and Michael R. Strain of the American Enterprise Institute
have a similar proposal.

Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at Upwork, and John Lettieri, the
president of the Economic Innovation Group in Washington, [want the
government to guarantee
loans](https://eig.org/news/main-street-rescue-and-resiliency-program)
with little or no interest that small businesses would pay back over a
long period, regardless of whether they lay off workers. Mr. Ozimek said
it would be wrong not to help companies that have already been forced
into layoffs by government decisions and delays in a federal response.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“When the government is this late to the party,” he said, “they
shouldn’t punish small businesses who acted fast.”

Economists stress that a successful program would be expensive: $1
trillion or more. Mr. Hubbard said a $300 billion loan program, [as
Senate Republicans
proposed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/us/politics/1000-checks-coronavirus-stimulus.html)
on Thursday, would be “woefully inadequate.”

Mr. Hamilton said this week that he worried members of Congress had “not
come to terms with the scale” of what was needed. “Any fiscal package
less than $1.5 trillion will be inadequate,” he said, “and frankly lead
to a Great Depression-level economic collapse.”

## Provide big relief for workers.

Companies are only half the equation. For the shutdown/restart strategy
to work, economists say, lawmakers must also keep money flowing to
workers affected by the economic chill so they can continue to buy
groceries, pay mortgage or rent and seek medical care if they are
injured or sick.

One way to do that is by helping businesses — and hopefully keeping as
many people as possible on payrolls, even if they are not working. But
workers who lose jobs or hours will need more direct
help.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a

Many economists, including Claudia Sahm of the Washington Center for
Equitable Growth and N. Gregory Mankiw and Jason Furman of Harvard
University, have called on lawmakers to send checks of $1,000 or more to
all Americans as quickly as possible. Both Mr. Trump and Steven Mnuchin,
the Treasury secretary, have voiced support for such payments. At least
a scaled-back version of that plan is likely to be included in the
stimulus bill being negotiated in Congress, with payments headed to low-
and middle-income families.

But those payments will not be sufficient to cover costs of necessities
for people who have suddenly seen their incomes shrink or vanish.

For that, economists say, Congress needs [an emergency safety
net](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/us/politics/congress-coronavirus-economy.html)
that would sustain income for all workers who are laid off or otherwise
hurt by the effects of the virus. Ideally, the economists say, that
safety net would aid the public health strategy embedded in the economic
shutdowns by paying as many people as possible to stay home from work
and practice social distancing.

That could mean increased unemployment benefits and more generous paid
sick leave fully funded by the government. It could also mean something
like what the British government announced Friday: a plan to encourage
businesses to keep paying workers by assuming up to 80 percent of their
wage costs.

“You need an unemployment system that in this moment can pivot to 100
percent reimbursement to 100 percent of people who are not at work,”
said Heather Boushey, the president of the Washington Center for
Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality and growth. “And
wage replacement for people who have hours cut back.”

## Don’t think of this as a ‘normal’ rescue.

Americans also need to start thinking of this crisis as different from
almost any economic shock before it.

Concerns that have guided economists in the past, like whether policies
discourage people from working, do not apply in the same way now: It is
hard to discourage work in sectors that the government has ordered to
shut down. The same may hold for restrictions that some lawmakers want
to place on spending any government aid to business, like limiting
grants to businesses that keep all their workers on salary, Mr. Lettieri
and others say.

Joseph S. Vavra, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School
of Business, said that policymakers typically try to stimulate consumer
demand during a recession and start recovery as quickly as possible.
Right now, the goal is almost the opposite.

“I don’t think what we’re trying to do is to get people to go out and
shop,” he said. “What we’re trying to do is provide some assistance to
households so they can sit at home and don’t have to go out and shop.”

The better parallel here might be World War II. The government is trying
to win a fight against a pandemic. That will mean spending big on the
battlefront — public health efforts, like ventilators and masks — and
asking personal and economic sacrifices from individuals to defeat the
virus and get life back to normal again.
