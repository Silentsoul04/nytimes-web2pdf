The coronavirus crisis has created uncertainty about whether the
gathering, scheduled for mid-July in Milwaukee, can still take place.

WASHINGTON --- Planners for the Democratic National Convention are
looking at ``contingency options'' in case the mid-July gathering in
Milwaukee can't take place because of the coronavirus, officials said on
Monday for the first time.

``As we navigate the unprecedented challenge of responding to the
coronavirus, we're exploring a range of contingency options to ensure we
can deliver a successful convention without unnecessary risk to public
health,'' said Katie Peters, a convention spokeswoman. ``This is a very
fluid situation --- and the convention is still more than three months
away. We are committed to sharing updates with the public in the coming
weeks and months as our plans continue to take shape.''

One person with knowledge of the discussions said Monday that
``intensive scenario-planning'' was taking place among officials from
the Democratic National Committee, the convention committee and the
Milwaukee host committee, who were all determining what to do about the
convention, which is scheduled for July 13 to July 16 at the Fiserv
Forum in Milwaukee.

Among the complicating factors are the uncertain nature of the
professional basketball season --- the arena hosting the convention is
home to the Milwaukee Bucks, a top N.B.A. team likely to play deep into
the playoffs if the league's season were to restart --- and how the
party's delegates will be selected. Delegates in most states are elected
to the national convention from state conventions, but many state
conventions, scheduled for late spring and early summer, are also being
postponed.

Convention planning is also hamstrung by the fact that as long as
Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} remains in the race, Democrats do not yet have a de facto
presidential nominee. Former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.}, who has an all but insurmountable delegate lead, cannot
take the reins of the convention process until either Mr. Sanders
concedes or Mr. Biden reaches a 1,991-delegate threshold.

Mr. Biden cannot accumulate more delegates until more states hold their
nominating contests. With many states
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html}{postponing
their primaries}, it would be impossible for Mr. Biden to reach 1,991
delegates before June, even if he won all of the delegates in each of
the upcoming primaries and caucuses.

A memo sent Friday from the leaders of the D.N.C.'s Rules and Bylaws
Committee said 18 states and Democrats Abroad had proposed changing
delegate selection plans previously submitted to and approved by the
D.N.C.

The proposed changes articulated in the memo include moving dates of
state party conventions where national convention delegates are
selected, modifying state party rules that govern the delegate selection
process to allow proxy voting, and allowing ``other methods in the steps
to select national convention delegates while implementing social
distancing in their state.''

Democratic officials said no major corporate donors had rescinded
financial pledges to the convention, but one person involved in
fund-raising for the event described the convention's fund-raising
status as ``frozen.''

Another person involved in planning the convention said there was still
time to make key decisions and emphasized that the party would have some
flexibility because members of the Lasry family, which owns the
Milwaukee Bucks and controls the Fiserv Forum, are significant
Democratic Party donors.
