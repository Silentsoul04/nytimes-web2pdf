President Trump on Sunday night said that the government would reassess
the recommended period for keeping businesses shut and millions of
workers at home after this week, amid millions of job losses caused by
the efforts to contain the spread of the novel
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/world/coronavirus-news.html).

“WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” [Mr. Trump
tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593)
in all capital letters shortly before midnight. “AT THE END OF THE 15
DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO\!”

Officials have said that the initial 15-day period for social distancing
— limiting close contact between people by banning gatherings, closing
schools and offices, encouraging remote work and urging people to
maintain a six-foot distance from one another — is vital to slowing the
spread of the virus, for which more than [30,000 people in the United
States have tested
positive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
The 15-day period would end Monday.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious diseases expert and a member of the
White House coronavirus task force, has said in interviews that he
believed that it would take several more weeks until people can start
going about their lives in a more normal fashion. Other infectious
disease experts suggest even harsher measures than social distancing are
[required to truly beat back the
outbreaks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html)in
the United States.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But at the White House, in recent days, there has been a growing
sentiment that medical experts were allowed to set policy that has [hurt
the
economy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/21/business/economy/coronavirus-recession.html),
and there has been a push to find ways to let people start returning to
work. Some Republican lawmakers have also pleaded with the White House
to find ways to restart the economy, as financial markets continue to
slide and job losses for April could be in the millions.

Vice President Mike Pence indicated on Sunday at a White House briefing
about the virus that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
would issue new guidelines on Monday, allowing some people who have been
exposed to the coronavirus to resume working outside their homes if they
wear masks.

The move could set the stage for states with relatively low numbers of
cases to begin to unfreeze their economies, while large states like
California and New York — where there are more cases and where state
officials have ordered nonessential businesses to close for the time
being — could continue remaining in a holding pattern.

While some business owners are eager to end the more draconian measures

Mr. Trump’s tweet cast doubt on his confidence in the path to fighting
the virus that he so reluctantly approved. For two months he largely
[dismissed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/18/us/trump-coronavirus-statements-timeline.html)
the warnings that the virus would reach American shores, for fear of
causing economic disruption, predicting that cases would go down from a
handful to “zero” in a few
days.

was he convinced to act.

Kong](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/asia/hong-kong-coronavirus-quarantine-intl-hnk/index.html),
after there had been an easing of the spread of the virus, is something
of an object lesson about how difficult it is for any territory to keep
the virus out.

In a tweet on Monday morning, Thomas Bossert, the former homeland
security adviser who for weeks has been vocal about the need for the
U.S. government to take stricter measures, said, “Sadly, the numbers now
suggest the U.S. is poised to take the lead in
[\#coronavirus](https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hashtag_click)
cases. It’s reasonable to plan for the US to top the list of countries
with the most cases in approximately 1 week. This does NOT make social
intervention futile. It makes it imperative\!”

Whatever the president chooses to do, there will be businesses still
fearful to reopen — and employees fearful of going to work — as new
cases of people infected with the virus are still being diagnosed by the
thousands each day.

And the president is facing potential pushback from the public health
experts in his administration.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After being slow to publicly react to the spread of the virus, the Trump
administration swung in the other direction at the end of February,
entrusting the health experts whose counsel had not been heeded in the
preceding weeks and letting them help set the policies that hundreds of
millions of people would be urged to follow.

But Mr. Trump has become frustrated with Dr. Fauci’s blunt approach at
the briefing lectern, which often contradicts things the president has
just said, according to two people familiar with the dynamic.

Mr. Trump knows that Dr. Fauci is seen as credible with a large swath of
the public and with journalists, and so he has given him more leeway to
contradict him than he has other officials. But the president has also
[resisted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/18/us/trump-coronavirus-statements-timeline.html)
portraying the virus as an existential threat in a way that the public
health experts
have.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

In an interview with [Science Magazine that was posted
online](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/i-m-going-keep-pushing-anthony-fauci-tries-make-white-house-listen-facts-pandemic)
on Sunday evening, Dr. Fauci responded to a question about how he had
managed not to get fired by saying that, to Mr. Trump’s “credit, even
though we disagree on some things, he listens.”

“He goes his own way,” Dr. Fauci continued. “He has his own style. But
on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.”

But he also said there was a limit to what he could do when Mr. Trump
said things that were not true during those briefings.

“I can’t jump in front of the microphone and push him down,” Mr. Fauci
said of Mr. Trump’s erroneous statements. “OK, he said it. Let’s try and
get it corrected for the next time.”

In an interview with Fox Business Network, the Treasury secretary,
Steven Mnuchin, stressed that the U.S. economy was still functioning.

“I’ve seen a bunch of fake news over the last couple of days about a
complete shutdown of the economy,” he said. “The president has not made
that decision.”

Later, in another Fox interview, Mr. Mnuchin said, “The cure can’t be
worse than the disease.”

The president’s interest in potentially easing some of the social
behavior guidelines met with pushback from one of his close allies,
Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.

“President Trump’s best decision was stopping travel from China early
on,” Mr. Graham
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1242082517223645184)
on Monday. “I hope we will not undercut that decision by suggesting we
back off aggressive containment policies within the United States.”

David McIntosh, the president of the anti-tax Club for Growth, suggested
Friday that the damage to the economy was severe.

“We need to act to contain the virus, but at the same time more people
would be hurt and have terrible health and life consequences if they
don’t reopen the economy,” Mr. McIntosh said. “They have to put an end
to the social distancing some time in the near future to restore
economic activity.”
