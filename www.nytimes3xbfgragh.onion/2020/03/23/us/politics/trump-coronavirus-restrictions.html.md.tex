The president, who has watched the economy plunge amid social distancing
measures, says restrictions will be reassessed.

President Trump on Sunday night said that the government would reassess
the recommended period for keeping businesses shut and millions of
workers at home after this week, amid millions of job losses caused by
the efforts to contain the spread of the novel
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/world/coronavirus-news.html}{coronavirus}.

``WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,''
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593}{Mr.
Trump tweeted} in all capital letters shortly before midnight. ``AT THE
END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE
WANT TO GO!''

Officials have said that the initial 15-day period for social distancing
--- limiting close contact between people by banning gatherings, closing
schools and offices, encouraging remote work and urging people to
maintain a six-foot distance from one another --- is vital to slowing
the spread of the virus, for which more than
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{30,000
people in the United States have tested positive}. The 15-day period
would end Monday.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious diseases expert and a member of the
White House coronavirus task force, has said in interviews that he
believed that it would take several more weeks until people can start
going about their lives in a more normal fashion. Other infectious
disease experts suggest even harsher measures than social distancing are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html}{required
to truly beat back the outbreaks}in the United States.

But at the White House, in recent days, there has been a growing
sentiment that medical experts were allowed to set policy that has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/21/business/economy/coronavirus-recession.html}{hurt
the economy}, and there has been a push to find ways to let people start
returning to work. Some Republican lawmakers have also pleaded with the
White House to find ways to restart the economy, as financial markets
continue to slide and job losses for April could be in the millions.

Vice President Mike Pence indicated on Sunday at a White House briefing
about the virus that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
would issue new guidelines on Monday, allowing some people who have been
exposed to the coronavirus to resume working outside their homes if they
wear masks.

The move could set the stage for states with relatively low numbers of
cases to begin to unfreeze their economies, while large states like
California and New York --- where there are more cases and where state
officials have ordered nonessential businesses to close for the time
being --- could continue remaining in a holding pattern.

While some business owners are eager to end the more draconian measures
that have been put in place, others would rather endure the pain at once
rather than face repeated, disruptive orders to stop activities.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/03/23/us/politics/23dc-virus-trump2/merlin_170867010_e31bab5b-4f57-4f37-be71-320bb72efad7-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Mr. Trump's tweet cast doubt on his confidence in the path to fighting
the virus that he so reluctantly approved. For two months he largely
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/18/us/trump-coronavirus-statements-timeline.html}{dismissed}
the warnings that the virus would reach American shores, for fear of
causing economic disruption, predicting that cases would go down from a
handful to ``zero'' in a few days.

Only when the disruption came anyway, in the form of a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/business/coronavirus-trump-stock-market.html}{historic
stock market sell-off}, was he convinced to act.

But there could be consequences to ending the measures too quickly. The
recent
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/asia/hong-kong-coronavirus-quarantine-intl-hnk/index.html}{rise
of imported cases in Hong Kong}, after there had been an easing of the
spread of the virus, is something of an object lesson about how
difficult it is for any territory to keep the virus out.

In a tweet on Monday morning, Thomas Bossert, the former homeland
security adviser who for weeks has been vocal about the need for the
U.S. government to take stricter measures, said, ``Sadly, the numbers
now suggest the U.S. is poised to take the lead in
\href{https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hashtag_click}{\#coronavirus}
cases. It's reasonable to plan for the US to top the list of countries
with the most cases in approximately 1 week. This does NOT make social
intervention futile. It makes it imperative!''

Whatever the president chooses to do, there will be businesses still
fearful to reopen --- and employees fearful of going to work --- as new
cases of people infected with the virus are still being diagnosed by the
thousands each day.

And the president is facing potential pushback from the public health
experts in his administration.

After being slow to publicly react to the spread of the virus, the Trump
administration swung in the other direction at the end of February,
entrusting the health experts whose counsel had not been heeded in the
preceding weeks and letting them help set the policies that hundreds of
millions of people would be urged to follow.

But Mr. Trump has become frustrated with Dr. Fauci's blunt approach at
the briefing lectern, which often contradicts things the president has
just said, according to two people familiar with the dynamic.

Mr. Trump knows that Dr. Fauci is seen as credible with a large swath of
the public and with journalists, and so he has given him more leeway to
contradict him than he has other officials. But the president has also
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/18/us/trump-coronavirus-statements-timeline.html}{resisted}
portraying the virus as an existential threat in a way that the public
health experts have.

In an interview with
\href{https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/i-m-going-keep-pushing-anthony-fauci-tries-make-white-house-listen-facts-pandemic}{Science
Magazine that was posted online} on Sunday evening, Dr. Fauci responded
to a question about how he had managed not to get fired by saying that,
to Mr. Trump's ``credit, even though we disagree on some things, he
listens.''

``He goes his own way,'' Dr. Fauci continued. ``He has his own style.
But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.''

But he also said there was a limit to what he could do when Mr. Trump
said things that were not true during those briefings.

``I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down,'' Mr. Fauci
said of Mr. Trump's erroneous statements. ``OK, he said it. Let's try
and get it corrected for the next time.''

In an interview with Fox Business Network, the Treasury secretary,
Steven Mnuchin, stressed that the U.S. economy was still functioning.

``I've seen a bunch of fake news over the last couple of days about a
complete shutdown of the economy,'' he said. ``The president has not
made that decision.''

Later, in another Fox interview, Mr. Mnuchin said, ``The cure can't be
worse than the disease.''

The president's interest in potentially easing some of the social
behavior guidelines met with pushback from one of his close allies,
Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.

``President Trump's best decision was stopping travel from China early
on,'' Mr. Graham
\href{https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1242082517223645184}{tweeted}
on Monday. ``I hope we will not undercut that decision by suggesting we
back off aggressive containment policies within the United States.''

David McIntosh, the president of the anti-tax Club for Growth, suggested
Friday that the damage to the economy was severe.

``We need to act to contain the virus, but at the same time more people
would be hurt and have terrible health and life consequences if they
don't reopen the economy,'' Mr. McIntosh said. ``They have to put an end
to the social distancing some time in the near future to restore
economic activity.''
