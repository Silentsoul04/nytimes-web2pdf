There was a bit of a cacophony at first, as conflicting melodies emerged
and subsided. This was the chaos of preparation, the warm-up, but after
a few moments the orchestra went quiet. It felt like a long, deep
breath, and so I took one, too. The graphic advertising the concert as
“Live From Benaroya Hall” in Seattle disappeared, revealing the
conductor, as he took his place onstage, all eyes on his upheld baton.
The music started softly and then grew stronger, filling my living room:
floating flutes, a charge of clarinets, the friendly vibrato of
bassoons. The strings played a single note, across seven
octaves.

It had been a scary week in Seattle, then the center of the [coronavirus
outbreak in the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus). The
virus was spreading in nursing homes, and there were more deaths being
reported every day. The governor of Washington had just banned all large
gatherings and closed all schools in the Seattle area. There were runs
on food and supplies. There were already layoffs and sure to be a lot
more. Though it was clear that we were at the very beginning of what
would be a long and spiraling crisis, the region’s hospitals were even
now running low on supplies, personnel and beds for critically ill
patients. Every small decision — to go to the store, to see friends, to
eat at restaurants, to visit the elderly — was suddenly taking on a new
moral weight. Within just a few days, as it sank in what truly caring
for one another needed to look like, even those choices would be
gone.

When I heard that the Seattle Symphony, which had been ordered to close
like everything else, would be livestreaming free concerts during the
crisis, I almost cried. I had never actually been to one of its
performances before, even though I live less than two miles from
Benaroya Hall. But now, seeing my city shut down around me, I couldn’t
wait to watch. The performance felt symbolic: a declaration that
connection and solidarity and collective beauty would continue, that we
could still gather together even as we stayed apart. I thought
immediately of the tiny poem Bertolt Brecht wrote in the midst of World
War II: “In the dark times/Will there be singing?/There will be
singing./Of the dark times.”

I pictured the musicians, dressed in their black suits and dresses,
playing to the emptiness of a grand theater, while the rest of us
gathered around our laptops — like the families, hungry for reassurance,
who listened to F.D.R.’s fireside chats during the Great Depression.
Another viewer thought of a different historical analogue: the musicians
on the Titanic who kept playing music for the ship’s passengers even as
it sank. “Getting big ‘Gentlemen, it has been a privilege’ vibes,” he
wrote in the chat box that accompanied the video. “Thanks for this.”

In fact, the performance wasn’t to an empty theater, or technically live
at all — it was a livestream of a concert filmed the previous September.
Alexander White, the symphony’s associate principal trumpet and chairman
of the musicians’ labor organization, told me that the idea of
continuing performances without audiences, which was under consideration
just two days earlier, evaporated the day before the livestream. The
symphony had been rehearsing Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 5 for its
upcoming shows when the governor’s news conference announcing
regulations on group gatherings began. “We realized the orchestra
couldn’t actually safely be together,” White said. As a brass player,
he was particularly aware of all the breath and moisture that regularly
moves through a crowd of musicians. For the first time White could
remember, everyone stopped playing mid-rehearsal, packed up and left.

In the chat box for the concert, viewers seemed puzzled. New arrivals
kept asking why the video showed a live audience in a shuttered city. A
commenter named David explained, “Not live, but not dead either.”
Someone else wrote: “Yeah, it’s confusing. But hey,
music.”

Over the next few days, as I stayed home and spent too much time reading
the news, it began to seem that the more people were separated and
confused and scared, the more there was music. Yo-Yo Ma started posting
performances with the hashtag \#SongsOfComfort, and more than three
million people [watched him play Antonin Dvorak’s “Going
Home.”](https://twitter.com/YoYo_Ma/status/1238572657278431234) The
Metropolitan Opera in New York announced it would be [streaming
previously filmed performances every
night](https://www.metopera.org/user-information/nightly-met-opera-streams/)
free; hundreds of thousands watched. High school students who wouldn’t
get to perform the spring musicals they’d been practicing started
singing for Twitter instead. A Seattle musician named Marina Albero, who
suddenly found all her gigs canceled and the schools where she teaches
closed, started organizing what she called “The Quarantine Sessions,”
streamed performances that would allow musicians to still play and
audiences to still support them. (When I called her, she stressed that
the money, while welcome, wasn’t the main point. “It’s about being
together and making something beautiful,” she said. “Nobody is anything
alone. That’s what this situation is demonstrating.”)

And from Italy, where a cascade of deaths in overwhelmed hospitals
presaged what we feared our own crisis would become, video after video
emerged of people in lockdown, standing on their balconies or leaning
out their windows, uniting the music of their violins and tambourines
and accordions and saxophones. They played patriotic tunes and folk
songs. They played “Smoke on the Water” and “Tequila.” Elderly women
stuck inside stepped onto their balconies and danced.

It took about an hour for the Seattle Symphony to perform Gustav
Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 in D major. The symphony is a glorious jumble,
rejected by its first audiences as too modern: It incorporates klezmer
accents, folk-dance melodies, a funeral march and victorious horn
crescendos. I kept waiting for the performance to feel solemn and
historic, to get goosebumps of the kind I have when I read Brecht’s poem
or think about people singing “There’ll Always Be an England” during the
Blitz. But instead it felt like life, strange and confusing and funny
and scary and beautiful, and still going on. In the chat box, people
leaned into the surreality of the situation, making jokes about the rude
noise of one another’s candy wrappers, about being tall and blocking
other people’s views of the stage, about whether “clap” emojis are
acceptable between movements, when real clapping, per symphony
etiquette, is not. “Mahler is an absolute unit of a composer,” someone
wrote; sex bots invaded the chat. People celebrated the music, told one
another where they were watching from and wished one another health and
luck and safety in a changed and scary world. White, the trumpet player,
watched the chat from his own computer. “It was endearing and
heartening,” he said. “But it was also reality.”

By the time it was over, nearly 90,000 people from Seattle and around
the world had tuned in. By comparison, 4,835 people bought tickets for
the original three-day run of the symphony, back in the other world that
was last September. The symphony made plans for more shows: experimental
solos filmed in homes or the empty hall; group pieces merged together
electronically; more livestreams of past performances. I knew I would
want to watch them. I wanted the deep breath, the feeling of connection,
even the jokes about sex bots. I wanted the woodwinds making the soft
sounds of nature and the brass section trumpeting victory, whatever that
might mean now.
