``You need a female fish,'' says Josh Lang, site manager at Sterling
Caviar's white-sturgeon farm in Elverta, Calif. It's nearly impossible
to ascertain a sturgeon's sex from the outside; Lang and his team use
ultrasound on 3-year-old fish to spot testes and ovaries. (Male fish and
females with small ovaries are killed for meat.) When the fish are 6,
start yearly biopsies by inserting a thin flexible sampling straw into
the abdomen and pulling out a few eggs. ``To determine whether it's
ready, you need to see, touch and taste it,'' Lang says.

It is still legal in some places to catch sturgeon in the wild and
harvest their eggs, but it is strongly discouraged, because most
sturgeon species are critically endangered. Take caviar from a farmed
fish. Squeeze the little glop of eggs from your sampling straw between
your fingers. You're looking for firm, equal-size eggs about three
millimeters in diameter. If you see smaller, white eggs, they aren't
mature. Squishy roe indicate that the fish has begun to reabsorb her
eggs, in order to recoup energy if stressed or if spawning conditions
aren't right. ``You'll need to wait about two years before that fish is
ripe again,'' Lang says.

Once identified, a ripe fish needs to be purged for the best-quality
caviar. That means extra cold, clean water and no food for weeks.
``Unfortunately,'' Lang says, ``the fish does not survive'' what comes
next. Position belly up and slice down the abdomen's center, being
careful not to let your knife slip to either side. Gently pull out the
ovaries, which can have as many as a million eggs. Rub them over a
screen to detach the roe from the ovary membrane. Egg color will vary by
fish and might include golds, browns and blacks. The most expensive
caviar Sterling sells contains two colors; one kilogram goes for
\$4,793. (Caviar from beluga sturgeon can sell for as much as \$10,000
per kilogram.)

Caviar can occasion fancy feelings, but it's good to situate those
momentary sensations in geologic time: Sturgeon evolved more than 100
million years ago; they were swimming in murky rivers when dinosaurs
roamed.
