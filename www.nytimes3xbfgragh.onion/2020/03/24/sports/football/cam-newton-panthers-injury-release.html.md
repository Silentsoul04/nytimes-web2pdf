# Carolina Releases Cam Newton, Completes Housecleaning

</div>

The quarterback, a former league M.V.P., was the most visible remnant of
the franchise’s old identity. Facing free agency with an uncertain foot
injury, 30-year-old Newton may be a tough sell.

The Carolina Panthers portrayed their decision to part after nine
seasons with quarterback [Cam
Newton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/sports/football/cam-newton-new-england-patriots.html)
as a magnanimous gesture. They [announced last
week](https://twitter.com/Panthers/status/1239929529780576256) that they
were granting him, the best player in franchise history, permission to
seek a trade.

But as [teams around the N.F.L. scurried to add
quarterbacks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/sports/football/nfl-free-agency.html),
Newton languished in a sort-of purgatory, neither part of Carolina’s
plans nor openly desired by another team, at least with his health
uncertain. He lingered there until Tuesday, when the Panthers, with no
leverage to push for compensation, released him. It was an
unceremonious, if by now expected, conclusion to his career in Carolina,
where his Superman-referencing touchdown celebrations, [sartorial
panache](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/12/12/fashion/NFL-Cam-Newton-fined-for-fashion-faux-pas.html)
and dazzling, if sometimes uneven, play vaulted the Panthers into
relevance.

“He’s the ultimate competitor and it physically hurts him to lose,”
Panthers general manager Marty Hurney said [in a
statement](https://www.panthers.com/news/carolina-panthers-release-qb-cam-newton).
“He willed this team to victory on many occasions and will always be
considered one of the greatest players in the history of this
franchise.”

At his apex, Newton, who turns 31 in May, dominated with his arm and
feet, winning the N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award in 2015. His
comfort with college concepts, picked up at the University of Florida
and [powerhouse Blinn
College](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/03/sports/football/super-bowl-50-cam-newton-blinn-college.html)
and honed at Auburn, helped fuel the read-option style that has since
[infiltrated the
league](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/13/sports/air-raid-kliff-kingsbury-kyler-murray.html).
But shoulder problems slowed him at the end of the 2018 season, and he
had the misfortune of sustaining a more serious injury — to the Lisfranc
ligament of his left foot, necessitating surgery — a few months before a
pandemic disrupted off-season N.F.L. player movement.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Newton, who was [placed on injured
reserve](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/05/sports/football/cam-newton-injury-season.html)
in early November, missed the Panthers’ final 14 games, meaning that
potential suitors have not watched him play since Week 2, when he
completed 49 percent of his passes in a loss to Tampa Bay. Since players
are barred from traveling to teams’ practice facilities, this off-season
is more challenging than normal for Newton to demonstrate his recovery.

It is a reflection of both the quick-moving quarterback market and the
state of the league amid a global crisis that Carolina found a deal to
trade another of its quarterbacks — [Kyle Allen, who started in Newton’s
absence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/21/sports/football/backup-quarterback-teddy-bridgewater-mahomes.html)
— for a fifth-round pick (from Washington) and yet could locate no
compensation for a player of Newton’s caliber.

Newton is listed at 6-foot-5 and 245 pounds but somehow seems bigger,
and ever since Carolina drafted him first overall, in 2011, he has been
synonymous with a franchise transformed by his arrival. Now he is gone,
as are so many familiar Panthers, from safety Eric Reid (released) to
longtime coach [Ron Rivera (fired, in
December)](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/sports/football/why-was-ron-rivera-fired.html)
to the star middle linebacker [Luke Kuechly, who
retired](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/sports/football/luke-kuechly-concussions-retire.html)
in January.

Since [losing to Denver in Super
Bowl 50](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/08/sports/football/broncos-win-super-bowl-50.html),
Carolina has finished in last place in the N.F.C. South more often
(twice) than it made the playoffs (once). It has embarked on a grand
retooling since the team’s 2018 [sale to owner David A.
Tepper](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/15/sports/football/carolina-panthers-sold-jerry-richardson-david-tepper.html),
who wants to enhance conditions for players and fans — a new practice
facility in South Carolina and an upgraded stadium in Charlotte, N.C. —
while supplementing his portfolio with a Major League Soccer franchise.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He lured a new coach, Matt Rhule, from Baylor with a seven-year contract
[reportedly
worth](https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1214583051478601728)
about $60 million, and authorized the hiring of a coveted offensive
coach, Joe Brady, from national champion L.S.U., to return the Panthers
to glory. They homed in on Newton’s successor last week, signing Teddy
Bridgewater to a three-year deal, and as other teams also rushed to add
quarterbacks — [Tom Brady to Tampa
Bay](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/sports/football/tom-brady-signed-tampa-bay.html),
Philip Rivers to Indianapolis, Marcus Mariota to Las Vegas — Newton
found himself on the periphery, like Jameis Winston, another former No.
1 overall pick in search of a new home.

There are, for Newton and Winston, fewer obvious spots than quarterbacks
available. Even though the Los Angeles Chargers have professed that they
will forge ahead with Tyrod Taylor (and, perhaps, a quarterback drafted
in April), Newton would look marvelous on a team that appears to have
improved this off-season. And New England, rumor has it, could be
looking for a quarterback, too.

In the cold, remorseless N.F.L., longtime relationships rarely end with
both parties satisfied. Even Eli Manning, who concluded his retirement
speech in January by pledging eternal loyalty to the Giants, endured a
difficult final season, in which [he was
benched](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/17/sports/eli-manning-giants-daniel-jones.html)
for much of it. Newton, per [his
response](https://twitter.com/JourdanRodrigue/status/1239939358431600641)
to a Panthers post on Instagram last week, said was “forced” into
consenting to be traded.

At this stage, it is really just semantics. He and the Panthers have
moved on from each other, and just how long Newton remains unemployed
depends, in large part, on his health, which will determine whether he
re-emerges as a solid quarterback — let alone an elite one — once more.
