\section{Carolina Releases Cam Newton, Completes
Housecleaning}\label{carolina-releases-cam-newton-completes-housecleaning}}

The quarterback, a former league M.V.P., was the most visible remnant of
the franchise's old identity. Facing free agency with an uncertain foot
injury, 30-year-old Newton may be a tough sell.

The Carolina Panthers portrayed their decision to part after nine
seasons with quarterback
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/sports/football/cam-newton-new-england-patriots.html}{Cam
Newton} as a magnanimous gesture. They
\href{https://twitter.com/Panthers/status/1239929529780576256}{announced
last week} that they were granting him, the best player in franchise
history, permission to seek a trade.

But as
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/sports/football/nfl-free-agency.html}{teams
around the N.F.L. scurried to add quarterbacks}, Newton languished in a
sort-of purgatory, neither part of Carolina's plans nor openly desired
by another team, at least with his health uncertain. He lingered there
until Tuesday, when the Panthers, with no leverage to push for
compensation, released him. It was an unceremonious, if by now expected,
conclusion to his career in Carolina, where his Superman-referencing
touchdown celebrations,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/12/12/fashion/NFL-Cam-Newton-fined-for-fashion-faux-pas.html}{sartorial
panache} and dazzling, if sometimes uneven, play vaulted the Panthers
into relevance.

``He's the ultimate competitor and it physically hurts him to lose,''
Panthers general manager Marty Hurney said
\href{https://www.panthers.com/news/carolina-panthers-release-qb-cam-newton}{in
a statement}. ``He willed this team to victory on many occasions and
will always be considered one of the greatest players in the history of
this franchise.''

At his apex, Newton, who turns 31 in May, dominated with his arm and
feet, winning the N.F.L.'s Most Valuable Player Award in 2015. His
comfort with college concepts, picked up at the University of Florida
and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/03/sports/football/super-bowl-50-cam-newton-blinn-college.html}{powerhouse
Blinn College} and honed at Auburn, helped fuel the read-option style
that has since
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/13/sports/air-raid-kliff-kingsbury-kyler-murray.html}{infiltrated
the league}. But shoulder problems slowed him at the end of the 2018
season, and he had the misfortune of sustaining a more serious injury
--- to the Lisfranc ligament of his left foot, necessitating surgery ---
a few months before a pandemic disrupted off-season N.F.L. player
movement.

Newton, who was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/05/sports/football/cam-newton-injury-season.html}{placed
on injured reserve} in early November, missed the Panthers' final 14
games, meaning that potential suitors have not watched him play since
Week 2, when he completed 49 percent of his passes in a loss to Tampa
Bay. Since players are barred from traveling to teams' practice
facilities, this off-season is more challenging than normal for Newton
to demonstrate his recovery.

It is a reflection of both the quick-moving quarterback market and the
state of the league amid a global crisis that Carolina found a deal to
trade another of its quarterbacks ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/21/sports/football/backup-quarterback-teddy-bridgewater-mahomes.html}{Kyle
Allen, who started in Newton's absence} --- for a fifth-round pick (from
Washington) and yet could locate no compensation for a player of
Newton's caliber.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/03/24/sports/24nfl-cam-2/merlin_103860430_d567e8ee-8a9f-40bf-8cba-fa31acb554d8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Newton is listed at 6-foot-5 and 245 pounds but somehow seems bigger,
and ever since Carolina drafted him first overall, in 2011, he has been
synonymous with a franchise transformed by his arrival. Now he is gone,
as are so many familiar Panthers, from safety Eric Reid (released) to
longtime coach
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/sports/football/why-was-ron-rivera-fired.html}{Ron
Rivera (fired, in December)} to the star middle linebacker
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/sports/football/luke-kuechly-concussions-retire.html}{Luke
Kuechly, who retired} in January.

Since
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/08/sports/football/broncos-win-super-bowl-50.html}{losing
to Denver in Super Bowl 50}, Carolina has finished in last place in the
N.F.C. South more often (twice) than it made the playoffs (once). It has
embarked on a grand retooling since the team's 2018
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/15/sports/football/carolina-panthers-sold-jerry-richardson-david-tepper.html}{sale
to owner David A. Tepper}, who wants to enhance conditions for players
and fans --- a new practice facility in South Carolina and an upgraded
stadium in Charlotte, N.C. --- while supplementing his portfolio with a
Major League Soccer franchise.

He lured a new coach, Matt Rhule, from Baylor with a seven-year contract
\href{https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1214583051478601728}{reportedly
worth} about \$60 million, and authorized the hiring of a coveted
offensive coach, Joe Brady, from national champion L.S.U., to return the
Panthers to glory. They homed in on Newton's successor last week,
signing Teddy Bridgewater to a three-year deal, and as other teams also
rushed to add quarterbacks ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/sports/football/tom-brady-signed-tampa-bay.html}{Tom
Brady to Tampa Bay}, Philip Rivers to Indianapolis, Marcus Mariota to
Las Vegas --- Newton found himself on the periphery, like Jameis
Winston, another former No. 1 overall pick in search of a new home.

There are, for Newton and Winston, fewer obvious spots than quarterbacks
available. Even though the Los Angeles Chargers have professed that they
will forge ahead with Tyrod Taylor (and, perhaps, a quarterback drafted
in April), Newton would look marvelous on a team that appears to have
improved this off-season. And New England, rumor has it, could be
looking for a quarterback, too.

In the cold, remorseless N.F.L., longtime relationships rarely end with
both parties satisfied. Even Eli Manning, who concluded his retirement
speech in January by pledging eternal loyalty to the Giants, endured a
difficult final season, in which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/17/sports/eli-manning-giants-daniel-jones.html}{he
was benched} for much of it. Newton, per
\href{https://twitter.com/JourdanRodrigue/status/1239939358431600641}{his
response} to a Panthers post on Instagram last week, said was ``forced''
into consenting to be traded.

At this stage, it is really just semantics. He and the Panthers have
moved on from each other, and just how long Newton remains unemployed
depends, in large part, on his health, which will determine whether he
re-emerges as a solid quarterback --- let alone an elite one --- once
more.
