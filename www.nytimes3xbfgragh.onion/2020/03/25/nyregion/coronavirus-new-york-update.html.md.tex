Though the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to grow
quickly and has now topped 30,000, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday
said that there were early signs that stringent restrictions on social
gatherings and other measures could be slowing the virus's spread.

Mr. Cuomo highlighted data that showed slowing hospitalization rates. On
Sunday, the state's projections showed hospitalizations doubling every
two days, while Tuesday's estimates showed them doubling every 4.7 days.

``That is almost too good to be true,'' the governor said, ``but the
theory is, given the density that we're dealing with, it spreads very
quickly, but if you reduce the density, you can reduce the spread very
quickly.''

Other highlights from Wednesday:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  New York State has 30,811 confirmed cases, up more than 5,000 since
  Tuesday morning. That is more than 7 percent of the 431,000 cases
  worldwide
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\#us}{tallied
  by The New York Times}. There have been 285 deaths in the state.
\item
  Officials reported late Wednesday that New York City had added 3,223
  new confirmed cases since the morning, bringing the city's total to
  20,011. The death tally stood at 280, up from 199 in the morning.
\item
  There was encouraging news from Westchester County, where the rate of
  infection has slowed. ``We have dramatically slowed what was an
  exponential rate of increase,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ``That was the hottest
  cluster in the United States of America. We closed the schools, we
  closed gatherings, we brought in testing, and we have dramatically
  slowed the increase.''
\item
  State officials project they will need 30,000 ventilators, of which
  they currently have 4,000. But the state is making headway: Mr. Cuomo
  said 7,000 more ventilators have been procured, in addition to 4,000
  ventilators sent by the federal government.
\item
  The governor said about 40,000 health care professionals, including
  retirees, have volunteered to work when hospitals become strained.
  Almost half are nurses.
\item
  More than 3,800 people are currently hospitalized, or 12 percent of
  all confirmed cases. Of those, 888 people are currently in intensive
  care.
\item
  In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy announced 736 new cases, bringing
  the total in the state to 4,402, including 62 deaths.
\end{itemize}

Mr. Cuomo's comments came the morning after federal officials, alarmed
over the infection rate in New York City, urged anyone leaving the city
to quarantine themselves for 14 days before mingling with the general
population elsewhere.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, said that New Yorkers who were
``understandably'' trying to leave for places like Florida needed to
make sure they were not ``seeding'' the rest of the United States.

``When they go to another place, for their own safety, they have to be
careful,'' Dr. Fauci said.

State and city officials in New York had hoped that Congress would
soften the blow of the pandemic on household budgets and government
coffers with a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/us/politics/coronavirus-senate-deal.html}{\$2
trillion stimulus package} that was expected to be approved this week.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said
the deal's benefits for New York included over \$40 billion in
unemployment insurance, grants for hospitals and much-needed funding for
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-mta-cuts-.html}{whose
ridership had plummeted}.

But Mr. Cuomo complained on Wednesday that the package was ``terrible''
for New York. He said that only \$3.1 billion was earmarked to help the
state with its budget gap, a sum his office said was disproportionately
low compared with what states with fewer confirmed cases and with
smaller budgets were in line to get.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at a news briefing later on Wednesday,
went further, calling the deal ``immoral.'' Mr. de Blasio said New York
City would be getting only \$1 billion, despite having one-third of the
country's virus cases. He said he planned to appeal directly to
President Trump, a native New Yorker, to ``fix this situation.''

``It should have been one of the easiest no-brainers in the world for
the U.S. Senate to include real money for New York City and New York
State in this stimulus bill, and yet it didn't happen,'' Mr. de Blasio,
a Democrat, said, putting the blame on Senator Mitch McConnell, the
Republican majority leader.

\subsection{Mayor debunks the idea of returning to normal in

Mr. de Blasio continued to emphasize on Wednesday how urgently the city
needed supplies to cope with the crush of new cases. He said he
appreciated the assistance the federal government had committed to
providing, but that more was required. And he again called for the U.S.
military to get more directly involved and in a much bigger way.

The mayor warned New Yorkers to relinquish any hope of a return to
normal life by April, rejecting
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-easter.html}{the
president's comments this week} that he wanted the economy to reopen by
Easter. City residents should prepare for the possibility that
conditions could worsen in May, he said.

Citing various projections, the mayor said at least half of all New
Yorkers could contract the virus, an estimate similar to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/us/California-stay-at-home-order-virus.html}{those
that officials have given in California}. But Mr. de Blasio noted that
for 80 percent of those who were infected, it would be ``a very limited
experience.''

The mayor also said that New Yorkers were ``overwhelmingly'' following
social-distancing guidelines, but that there were exceptions. To address
one of those, he said, the city would remove hoops from 80 of the city's
1,700 basketball courts where pickup games were still being played.

A man who had been living in New York City's shelter died after being
hospitalized with the coronavirus for several days, officials said on
Wednesday.

It was the first virus-related death of a homeless person in the vast
system of 450 traditional shelters, hotels and private apartment
buildings that the city uses to house homeless families and single
adults. As of Wednesday, there were 39 confirmed coronavirus cases among
27 shelters, according to the city's Department of Social Services.

The agency did not identify the man or provide additional details about
him, but said he had been living in a shelter for single adults.

``Tragically, one New Yorker experiencing homelessness succumbed to this
virus after several days in the hospital,'' Isaac McGinn, a spokesman
for the social services agency, said in an emailed statement. ``Our
hearts go out to this individual's friends and family.''

The city has around 100 shelters specifically for single adults. In the
current environment, such shelters pose a particular challenge for the
homeless services department because most of them have dormitory-style
sleeping quarters and shared bathrooms.

People living in shelters have complained that social distancing is
nearly impossible, and they have questioned whether the buildings were
being cleaned frequently enough.

The virus has spread quickly in the shelter system. At the beginning of
last week, a woman in her 50s living in a shelter for single women was
the only confirmed positive case. The woman has fully recovered and was
out of quarantine, Mr. McGinn said.

Times

In several hours on Tuesday, Dr. Ashley Bray performed chest
compressions at Elmhurst Hospital Center on a woman in her 80s, a man in
his 60s and a 38-year-old who reminded the doctor of her fiancé. All had
tested positive for the coronavirus and had gone into cardiac arrest.
All eventually died.

Elmhurst, a 545-bed public hospital in Queens, has begun transferring
patients not suffering from coronavirus to other facilities as
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html}{it
moves toward becoming a facility dedicated entirely to the outbreak}.
Doctors and nurses have struggled to make do with a few dozen
ventilators. Calls over a loudspeaker of ``Team 700,'' the code for when
a patient is on the verge of death, come several times a shift. Some
have died inside the emergency room while waiting for a bed.

A refrigerated truck has been stationed outside to hold the bodies of
the dead. Over the past 24 hours, New York City's public hospital system
said in a statement, 13 people at Elmhurst had died.

``It's apocalyptic,'' said Dr. Bray, a general medicine resident at the
hospital.

Across the city, which has become the epicenter of the coronavirus
outbreak in the United States, hospitals are beginning to confront the
kind of harrowing surge in cases that has overwhelmed health care
systems in China, Italy and other countries. On Wednesday morning, New
York City reported 16,788 confirmed cases and 199 deaths.

While life in New York City and the surrounding area has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-apex-andrew-cuomo.html}{come
to a screeching halt}, the construction industry, one of the region's
main economic engines and biggest employers, is humming along as if
nothing has changed.

Laborers work side by side, cramming 20-people deep into service
elevators and sharing the same portable restroom.

While Mr. Cuomo
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-is-shelter-in-place-coronavirus.html}{has
told New Yorkers to stay indoors} in a furious effort to stem the spread
of the coronavirus, construction workers have been deemed essential
employees, meaning they have to continue working even as most of the
work force stays home.

Across the country, governors and mayors have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html}{urged
roughly half of the United States} --- at least 179 million people ---
to stay home. The only people who should go outside, they say, are
emergency responders and those considered essential, a wide-ranging term
with different meanings in each state.

In New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and most of the country,
construction workers have fallen into the essential category. In New
York City, which had
\href{https://osc.state.ny.us/osdc/report-2-2020.pdf}{nearly 158,000
construction jobs in 2018}, laborers are hauling hard hats and tools on
nearly empty subways and trains every morning on the way to job sites.

``I'm essential to the pocketbooks of rich contractors and essential for
spreading the virus, but that's about it,'' said Kirk Gibbs, 57, an
electrician at a new parking garage in Syracuse, N.Y. ``It's not
essential for us to be here right now.''

With most of the big hotels in New York City either closed or making
plans to close, some are offering to house doctors, nurses and other
workers on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.

On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Twitter that the high-end
Four Seasons hotel on East 57th Street, which closed temporarily last
week with hopes of reopening in late April, would provide free
accommodations to ``medical personnel currently working to respond'' to
the pandemic.

The Four Seasons, which is owned by the Beanie Babies founder Ty Warner,
was ``the first of many hotels we hope will make their rooms
available,'' Mr. Cuomo said.

There is an abundance of rooms that could be made available. A list
circulating among hotel industry officials shows that hotels that have
closed their doors or plan to contain more than 30,000 rooms.

The list contains some of the city's biggest and best-known, including
the Grand Hyatt, the New Yorker, the Ritz Carlton, the Pierre, the Plaza
and the St. Regis. Most have given notice to the main union of hotel
workers in the city, the Hotel Trades Council, that they plan to reopen
from mid-April to late June.
