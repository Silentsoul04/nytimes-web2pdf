In the novelist Barbara Kingsolver's timely forthcoming collection of
poems, ``How to Fly (In Ten Thousand Easy Lessons),'' one section of
potent how-tos help guide readers through awkward, complicated days.
Refreshing in their direct address --- ``O misery'' --- and succinct
language, they place momentary dramas into context and provide a wider
window in. ``Remind me again,'' this poem says --- but the cure is not
immediate, the challenge continues. At least a good night's rest might
help. \emph{Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye}

\emph{By Barbara Kingsolver}

O misery. Imperfect\\
universe of days stretched out\\
ahead, the string of pearls\\
and drops of venom on the web,\\
losses of heart, of life\\
and limb, news of the worst:

Remind me again\\
the day will come\\
when I look back amazed\\
at the waste of sorry salt\\
when I had no more than \emph{this}\\
to cry about.

Now I lay me down.\\
I'm not there yet.
