North Korean ships distance themselves from Chinese ships and territory,
bringing the country's revenue stream from illicit exports of coal and
other commodities to a sudden halt.

President Trump has called the coronavirus
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/us/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-trump-stimulus.html}{``the
invisible enemy.''} But when it comes to sanctions on North Korea, the
pathogen may turn out to be his administration's most effective ally.

North Korea's fear of coronavirus infection appears to have achieved
what Mr. Trump's ``maximum pressure'' campaign against North Korean
nuclear and missile work has not: choking the North's economy by
stopping its trafficking of coal and other goods, prohibited under
United Nations sanctions, which is believed to be mostly with China.

According to a
\href{https://rusi.org/commentary/rickety-anchor-north-korea-calls-its-illicit-shipping-fleet-home-amid-coronavirus-fears}{satellite-image
analysis} published Thursday by the
\href{https://rusi.org/project/project-sandstone}{Royal United Services
Institute}, a London-based research organization, and a review of
additional satellite imagery by The New York Times, many North Korean
commercial vessels that once carried sanctioned material to and from
China --- or transferred them illicitly ship-to-ship at sea --- are now
idled in their home ports.

The change, seen after North Korea sought to seal itself off two months
ago as neighboring China battled the coronavirus outbreak, effectively
puts ``an end to the large and coordinated efforts to evade United
Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSC) by shipping resources to
China,'' according to the analysis.

The State Department declined through a spokesperson to comment on the
analysis or its implications.

The new findings show for the first time how a large number of North
Korean ships have moved back to Nampo, a vital port region on North
Korea's western coast.

United Nations sanctions ban the export of many North Korean commodities
--- such as coal --- and limit its fuel imports. However, a draft of the
forthcoming annual report from a United Nations panel of experts that
monitors compliance with the sanctions, which was seen by The Times,
states that North Korea ** ``continued to flout U.N. Security Council
resolutions through illicit maritime exports of commodities, notably
coal and sand. Such sales provide a revenue stream that has historically
contributed to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.''

The U.N. report only covers the time frame up to early February, and
does not account for the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Royal United Services Institute satellite analysis shows that on
March 3, 139 ships were idled in the Nampo area, which includes the
anchorage and several ports, up from 50 ships a month earlier.

The fleet includes vessels previously implicated in sanctions evasion
operations, which are often tracked through satellite imagery and aerial
or ground surveillance by
\href{https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/dprk_vessels.aspx}{other
states}, independent research groups and the
\href{https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1718/panel_experts/reports}{United
Nations.}

The institute's analysis said the idled ships included some of the
``most active and scrutinized oil tankers'' used for the illicit import
of refined petroleum products such as fuel. For example, the oil tanker
New Regent, which had been spotted making unreported deliveries as
recently as
\href{https://rusi.org/publication/other-publications/project-sandstone-report-6-phantom-fleet-north-korea\%E2\%80\%99s-smugglers}{January
2020}, and twice in 2019, according to the United Nations, was seen in
Nampo in multiple satellite images. Other ships, too, have been floating
unused for weeks, according to satellite imagery provided
by\href{https://www.planet.com/}{Planet Labs}, an earth-imaging company
in San Francisco, and \href{https://www.maxar.com/}{Maxar Technologies
Inc}., a space technology company in Westminster, Colo.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/03/26/video/26nk-newregent/26nk-newregent-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

The possible drop in fuel imports, which are often done through illicit
ship-to-ship transfers and deliveries involving vessels such as the New
Regent, would affect North Korea's agriculture sector, right at the
beginning of the farming season. Diesel is used for powering water pumps
in agriculture.

And the overall current restrictions on legitimate trade, also
attributable to the pandemic, carry additional risks for North Korean
farming.

``There could be disruptions of the food planting season, which starts
now, for example, because of an interruption of fertilizer imports from
China,'' said Daniel Wertz, program manager for the
\href{https://www.ncnk.org/}{National Committee on North Korea}, a
Washington-based group that advocates improved ties between North Korea
and the United States.

An increase in the number of idled North Korean cargo ships can also be
seen in Chongjin, another important industrial port city on the
country's east coast, 50 miles from the Chinese border.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/03/26/autossell/GFX_A_WSB_NAMPO_v1/GFX_A_WSB_NAMPO_v1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg}

The recall of ships is part of North Korea's border closures, which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/21/world/asia/coronavirus-china-north-korea-tourism-ban.html}{started
on Jan. 22}, the same time the Chinese authorities announced the
shutdown of the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus
outbreak.

Park Jong-chol, professor at the Department of Social Studies Education
at South Korea's Gyeongsang National University, said the economic
impact on North Korea from idling so many ships is severe.

``Official and informal trade is now suspended. Therefore,
transportation systems such as ships and trucks have been drastically
reduced,'' Mr. Park said.

``Corona is more threatening than U.N. Security Council sanctions,'' he
said. ``Production and income, including gasoline, have been an issue,
and many ships have been unable to operate.''

One returned ship, the Tian Tong,
\href{https://rusi.org/publication/other-publications/project-sandstone-report-6-phantom-fleet-north-korea\%E2\%80\%99s-smugglers}{suspected
of transporting North Korean coal} to China in October 2019, had been
spotted near China's Zhoushan Island, 600 miles south of Nampo, on Jan.
31 using a falsified transponder signal to disguise its
\href{https://www.nvmc.uscg.gov/(S(mzndz5zaouhzdtvaaooeu3sp))/CAATSA.aspx}{North
Korean origin}, a tactic used to conduct illicit trade. It returned to
North Korea in early February, and has been anchored outside Nampo since
at least Feb. 14, according to ship tracking data and satellite imagery
reviewed by The Times.

The long-term disruptions to North Korea's revenue stream remain
unclear, partly because the duration of the pandemic and its impact on
maritime commerce are not yet known.

But analysts said it was reasonable to assume damage has been done to
North Korean agriculture, industry and the overall economy.

``If their exports are declining, and coal smuggling or other operations
are interrupted, that might definitely have an impact,'' Mr. Wertz said.

In an analysis of China-North Korea trade published last month by
\href{https://www.38north.org/2020/02/dwertz022520/}{38North}, a website
that specializes in North Korea, Mr. Wertz wrote ominously about the
potential impact of the coronavirus: ``The next few months may provide a
grim natural experiment showing what might happen to the North Korean
economy if its economic linkages with China truly begin to be severed.''
