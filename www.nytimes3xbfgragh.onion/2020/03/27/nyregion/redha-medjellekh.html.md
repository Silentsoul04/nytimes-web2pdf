# How a Dance Video Director Spends His Sundays

</div>

Life in New York has shifted since Redha Medjellekh was photographed in
February. But his message in the video below remains the same: Keep
dancing.

-----

Redha Medjellekh has created videos for [the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater](https://www.alvinailey.org/) and for corporate clients like
Target. His company, [Red Is Dancing](http://www.redisdancing.com/),
also produces social commentary, like his response to the 2015 Paris
terrorist attacks, “[Paris Is
Kissing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ebjg-m9eLk),” and a
[tribute](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1tuy2THJjd/) to the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.

A French-Algerian immigrant from the outskirts of Paris, Mr. Medjellekh,
34, is a widower; his wife, Sandrine, died shortly after their daughter,
Amani, was born. He and Amani, now 5, live in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, in
the childhood apartment of the rapper [Biggie
Smalls](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1997/03/10/us/rapper-is-shot-to-death-in-echo-of-killing-6-months-ago.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**SAME PASSION, DIFFERENT DAY** I have the single-parent lifestyle. I
wake up at 5:30 or 6, which gives me a little bit of alone time before
the tornado — my daughter, Amani — wakes up. I’m obsessed with my work.
I’m blessed that it’s also my passion, so I don’t feel a Sunday is a
Sunday. It’s just a continuation of the week for me.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**ALONE TIME** I love to watch YouTube videos before Amani wakes up. It
can be about self-improvement, like Tony Robbins. I have lemon juice, or
I will do coffee. If my parents-in-law or my grandma or my parents are
here from France, it’s a whole different schedule because I am able to
go and do boxing. I love boxing. I will go train with the bag. To me
it’s like a dance. I miss it right now. I don’t have a bag but I have,
how do you say, a jump rope. I’m using that.

**VOILÀ** Very, very early on Sunday morning I will call my family in
France, because in France there’s a six-hour difference. Voilà.
Sometimes I’m alone, and sometimes I have family.

My grandma lives with me sometimes, although clearly she cannot be here
now. I call her Mamy Zaza. She’s 75. She’s the one who introduced me to
dance. She’s in Algeria right now, and I’m happy about that. I’m
FaceTiming with her every day, and with my parents, and with my parents
in-law. My parents caught the virus in Paris, but they’re feeling good.

Me, I’m Algerian, and so our culture is we’re always together. It was a
huge step for me to move to New York two years ago, but after my wife
died I had to move, I had to take action. Brooklyn feels like
home.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**BRUNCH SPOT** Before all the restaurants closed down, I liked to go to
[Risbo](https://www.risbobk.com/) for brunch. It’s an amazing place in
Flatbush. My friend Boris is the chef and owner. The food is a delicious
mix with all the cultures in it. There’s always music and there’s always
creative people. I love the Risbo plate. It has a little bit of
everything: it has hummus, it has rice, it has vegetables. Amani is
all-American. She has mac and cheese.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Since Risbo closed, Boris started crowdfunding for his employees. It’s a
tough moment for him because he wants to support them. If he’s hurt, six
people are hurt. It’s the ripple effect. I’m trying to support him by
getting takeout.

**SINGLE PARENT CREW** Then I’m usually with my S.P.C. — my single
parent crew. In better days, they would meet us at Risbo, and we would
go to [the Brooklyn Children’s Museum](https://www.brooklynkids.org/) or
a playground.

There’s Nasrin, there’s Niki and Farhia. They’re all amazing, creative
black women. They’re stylists, singers, creators. They all live in
Bed-Stuy or Clinton Hill. They all have a child Amani’s age. I’m the
only single father. They take care of me. They make fun of me.

Now I am also constantly checking in with them by text and WhatsApp to
see how we can help each other. Having their support is huge right now
since Mamy Zaza can’t travel to the U.S.A. from
Paris.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**MAINTENANCE** Once again, before the businesses shut down, I would go
to the barber every week. I’m bald with a beard. Instead of a haircut,
it’s more like how not to have the crown on your head. For me, the
barber was my integration to American culture. We don’t have barbers
like that in France. My barber is Peter, at [Levels
Barbershop](https://www.levelsbarbershop.com/).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now I have to do it myself. I’m letting the beard go wild.

**SHAKE IT** When the city is not in lockdown mode, I like to go to this
party called [Everyday People](https://www.everydayppl.nyc/). It changes
locations but most of the time it’s in Brooklyn. The culture is amazing
there. I will dance, shake my ass, sweat out all the stress of being an
entrepreneur, the stress of being a single parent. There’s everything
from dancehall to Afrobeat to hip-hop. To me it’s one of the best
parties in New York.

Hopefully, I can do it at home soon: I think they are trying to do it on
Instagram Live. They’re going to do a D.J. session online and I’m going
to tune into
that.

**COOKING** My grandma is known for her couscous. She will never tell
you what’s in it. I tried many times to take a video of how she does it.
She will never let you. When she visits, she does some sort of prep
before I wake up. I don’t even try to make it.

Food is a challenge now. Suddenly I have to make lunch for my child, so
she’s looking at me like I’m the cook. I’m making sandwiches and pasta.
It’s pretty intense for parents right now. That’s why I check in with
the single parent crew every
day.

**CURRENT PROJECT** In light of the coronavirus outbreak, I’ve thought a
lot about how it affects our interactions and how I can find ways to
inspire people to keep dancing. I’ve thought of a way to make videos
without shooting outside. I’m sending green screens to dancers I know
around the world. They’re going to perform the routine at home, and then
I’m going to integrate all the performances digitally. I plan to post it
on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/redisdancing/?hl=en) in about a
month.

We’ve got to keep on dancing, no matter what.
