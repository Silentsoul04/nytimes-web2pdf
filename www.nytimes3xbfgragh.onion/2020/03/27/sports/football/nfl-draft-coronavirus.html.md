# How the N.F.L. Draft Process Works From Home

With in-person contact limited, teams are rethinking their typically
rigorous approach to assessing prospects. “The organizations that handle
the stress best will win,” one team executive said.

The coronavirus pandemic has upended much, but with a late summer start
to the season five months away, the N.F.L. has been one of the few major
professional sports leagues to avoid postponing or canceling games.

With little else going on in sports, the league has doubled down on
holding its annual three-day
[draft](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/joe-burrow-nfl-draft.html)
— which ranks behind only the Super Bowl as the N.F.L.’s biggest
spectacle — beginning on April 23, altering the broadcast, which will
now be a TV-only studio production with top picks participating
remotely.

The N.F.L. is sticking to its self-imposed calendar even as the league
instituted travel restrictions and ordered team facilities closed,
forcing teams to adapt all-important evaluations that will impact their
fortunes for years to come, causing worries that draft selections might
go lower or higher than their available research would support.

“When we look back at the draft in two years, we’re going to see guys
who were overdrafted because of their familiarity and guys who were
under drafted in later rounds or not at all because they hadn’t been
seen or were injured,” said Mike Tannenbaum, an ESPN analyst and a
former N.F.L. general manager.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Social-distancing restrictions intended to contain the pandemic have
forced team scouts and general managers to work from home. Team doctors
cannot conduct physicals for prospective draft picks. And above all,
team executives must forgo vital face-to-face conversations with
prospects that are typically held on college campuses or at a team’s
headquarters.

Teams, of course, had already spent countless hours on the road,
scouting the top 100 or 200 prospects. Scouting personnel attended
college games, spoke to players’ coaches and families and watched at
all-star games and the league’s scouting combine in February, a weeklong
event that includes brief player interviews.

But success in the draft is often determined by the use of late-arriving
information or the unearthing of minute details that elevate unheralded
players to late-round picks. Often, talented players that are overlooked
visit team headquarters to give skeptical coaches a chance to size them
up.

That’s what the Jets did in 2007 when they brought in [Darrelle
Revis](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/ReviDa99.htm).
He entered the draft after his junior year, and coaches on the Jets had
questions about his talent because he played at Pittsburgh, which was
then in the Big East, a less prominent football conference.

But when Revis visited the Jets, the team’s personnel were impressed
with his knowledge and devotion to the game, as well as his close
relationship with his mother, which signaled that he had a good support
network, said Tannenbaum, who was the[Jets general
manager](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/executives/TannMi0.htm)
at the time.

“He met maybe 12, 14 people, and everyone said he’s our type of guy,”
Tannenbaum said. The team [traded up 11
spots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/04/29/sports/football/29jets.html)
in the first round to take Revis at No.
14.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak

#### Sports and the Virus

Updated Sept. 11, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - Baseball plans to [hold its playoff
        games](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/sports/baseball/mlb-postseason-neutral-sites.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) at
        four stadiums in Southern California and Texas, with the World
        Series held at the Texas Rangers’ new ballpark.
      - N.F.L. teams have spent years trying to create over-the-top
        entertainment for fans inside stadiums. This year, they’ll just
        be [trying to cover up
        echoes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/sports/football/what-will-nfl-games-sound-like.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) from
        empty seats.
      - September Saturdays at Penn State are usually the apex of a week
        of hype. Now, as at other college football destinations, the
        approach of autumn has been [unusually
        quiet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/sports/penn-state-college-football-canceled.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) there.

He quickly became one of the league’s top cornerbacks.

Teams are doing without those visits this year, instead relying on phone
interviews with players, and their coaches, families and friends, and
watching yet more game tape, trying to find new ways to assess
hard-to-qualify personality traits, such as players’ level of
narcissism, openness to criticism and new ideas, and interaction with
team personnel.

“Sometimes, you want to see someone in an uncomfortable situation and
see how they react, and in person, it’s always easier to do that,” said
Scott Pioli, a CBS Sports N.F.L. analyst who worked in player personnel
and as a general manager for the Patriots, Chiefs and Falcons, among
other teams. “The intangibles are really very tangible.”

Many of the people who make these widely watched picks say they have
been unable to do their jobs properly, and question whether even a
stripped-down draft should proceed as planned. This stretch of the
off-season has its own hectic cadence, including free agency and the
implementation of the new [10-year collective bargaining
agreement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/sports/football/nfl-cba-approved.html),
which has increased roster sizes and minimum salaries. The new
logistical hurdles related to the virus led a committee of general
managers to ask Commissioner Roger Goodell last week to delay the draft,
[according to
ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28950223/nfl-wants-april-draft-go-scheduled-gms-recommendation).

“This is not a fantasy draft that you conduct out there with just a list
of things on a piece of paper,” Mickey Loomis, the general manager of
the New Orleans Saints and a member of the committee, [told the Peter
King
Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/saints-gm-mickey-loomis-plus-jeff-darlington-on-tom/id1150960126?i=1000469442119)
for NBC Sports. “There’s a lot of work that goes into it to prepare and
there’s a lot of work that is done during the draft. Listen, it’ll be
very, very difficult to conduct that and do it in a way that you’re
doing justice to the process.”

Complicating matters, the [N.F.L. Physicians Society said in a
letter](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001107372/article/nflrelated-physicals-discontinued-due-to-covid19)
to the league and players union that team doctors would no longer
examine players, forcing teams to find other doctors to provide
physicals. “At a time of the most serious pandemic in our lifetime, we
believe medical resources should focus on those who are ill or in need
of care,” said Dr. Anthony Casolaro, the president of the society and
the Washington Redskins team doctor.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The difficulty in finding doctors and the inability to hold workouts has
forced teams to sign players contingent on their passing a physical.
Teams have been unable to fully assess free agents as well as college
players like [Tua
Tagovailoa](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/16/sports/ncaafootball/tua-tagovailoa-carted-off-injury-mississippi-state.html),
the Alabama quarterback who had a season-ending hip fracture in
November.

“You have to adapt,” said [Les
Snead](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/executives/SneaLe0.htm),
general manager of the Los Angeles Rams. “This can be a stressful time,
but the organizations that handle the stress best will win.”

Despite these limitations, the N.F.L. is forging ahead. In [a
memo](https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1243320919621279744)sent
to teams on Thursday, Goodell said rescheduling the draft would be
difficult because it was unclear when a better date would emerge. The
“public health conditions are highly uncertain and there is no
assurance that we can select a different date and be confident that
conditions will be significantly more favorable than they are today.”

Either way, it’s clear this year has been like none other in the N.F.L.,
disruptive in an entirely different way than the 2001 season, which
began in the wake of terrorist attacks.

“September 11th was such an unsettling time because of what went on, but
I remember a week later, with as much heartache as people had, they went
back to work and tried to get the country going again,” said Rich McKay,
the president of the Atlanta Falcons, who has been around the N.F.L. for
more than 40 years. “This time, we don’t know the end date, which makes
it more difficult.”
