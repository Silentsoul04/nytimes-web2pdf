Joe Biden tries to break through, Bernie Sanders signals he's staying in
and another Super Tuesday (of sorts) emerges.

Hello, from the socially distanced land of our comfy (read: tiny) New
York apartments!

Electoral politics as we know them are on pause at the moment, and the
coronavirus has upended the Democratic primary race in many ways. Here's
a look at exactly how, and notes on other things you might have missed
in the 2020 race this week.

\hypertarget{how-to-campaign-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak}{%
\subsection{How to campaign during the coronavirus
outbreak}\label{how-to-campaign-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak}}

As President Trump has appeared before the nation for daily briefings
and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-wartime-president.html}{labeled
himself a ``wartime president,''} former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.} --- the candidate who seems all but certain to face Mr.
Trump in the general election --- has faced questions online and even at
virtual fund-raisers about why he has kept a relatively low profile.

The outbreak has, of course, forced Mr. Biden and Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} of Vermont off the physical campaign trail. And the unusual
situation has left
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/us/politics/joe-biden-2020-virus.html}{Mr.
Biden trying to figure out how to position himself as a prominent voice
on the crisis}.

``I want to be in daily or at least, you know, significant contact with
the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think
we should be doing and how we should be doing it,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/us/politics/biden-trump-coronavirus.html}{Mr.
Biden said on Sunday}.

\hypertarget{reshaping-the-health-care-debate}{%
\subsubsection{Reshaping the health care
debate}\label{reshaping-the-health-care-debate}}

If you've watched any of the Democratic debates or attended any campaign
events, you know that health care has long been a central issue in the
2020 presidential race. Adding the coronavirus pandemic to the equation
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-health-care.html}{has
made the stakes even higher} and made the difference between Democratic
and Republican visions of what the system should look like even more
stark.

Advancing ``Medicare for all'' has, for two cycles now, been Mr.
Sanders's central policy priority, and our colleague
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/us/politics/bernie-sanders-coronavirus.html}{Sydney
Ember reports that} he ``believes he can meld this moment of national
crisis with the progressive policy agenda that has been his life's
work.''

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/us/politics/democratic-convention-milwaukee-coronavirus.html}{Our
  colleague Reid J. Epstein reports} that planners for the Democratic
  National Convention are looking at ``contingency options'' in case the
  mid-July gathering in Milwaukee can't take place.
\item
  Our colleague Dionne Searcey looked back at
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/21/us/politics/1918-flu-pandemic-elections.html}{how
  Americans managed to vote in 1918} when the nation was ravaged by the
  Spanish flu.
\item
  And our colleagues Katie Glueck and Sabrina Tavernise **** stopped to
  consider the fact that
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/us/politics/biden-trump-seniors.html}{the
  most powerful people in American politics are seniors}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{will-there-be-another-debate}{%
\subsection{Will there be another
debate?}\label{will-there-be-another-debate}}

Mr. Sanders would like to debate Mr. Biden again if, in fact, a debate
is held in April as originally planned.

``Senator Sanders is still running for president,'' Mike Casca, one of
his top campaign officials,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/us/politics/biden-sanders-next-democratic-debate.html}{said
on Tuesday}. ``If there is a debate in April, he plans to be there.''

Mr. Biden, not so much.

``I haven't thought about any more debates,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-next-debate.html}{he
said a day later}. ``I think we've had enough debates. I think we should
get on with this.''

The Democratic National Committee said previously that there would be a
debate in April, but one has not been scheduled and the committee has
not announced a media partner or a site host.

\hypertarget{how-about-another-super-tuesday}{%
\subsection{How about another Super
Tuesday?}\label{how-about-another-super-tuesday}}

Thanks to multiple postponements connected to public health concerns, as
many as 10 states and the District of Columbia may now hold primaries on
June 2, making it suddenly quite important to the Democratic race.

As of this writing,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/us/politics/biden-sanders-coronavirus-june-2.html}{June
2 would confer a trove of delegates so large} it would be second only to
Super Tuesday in early March. And as such, the June Tuesday that was
once an afterthought could now represent Mr. Biden's first chance to
clinch the presidential nomination.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We are keeping a
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{running

  primaries and caucuses.

  For a full list of which states are voting when, take a look at our

  wants to send everyone an absentee ballot in under two weeks.
\item
  In a

  memo}, our colleague Matt Flegenheimer observed that the election-year
  calendar seemed set in stone --- until suddenly it wasn't.

For us, just as for so many of you, the coronavirus outbreak has been
and will continue to be front of mind when it comes to news. Our
politics team will continue to vigorously cover the 2020 race and all of
the ways it is being affected by the pandemic, and we urge you to keep
reading. But for now, this weekly roundup will go on hiatus. We hope we
can rejoin you when things get a little bit more back to normal.
