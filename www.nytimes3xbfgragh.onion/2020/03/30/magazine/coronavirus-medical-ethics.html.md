**Health care workers** around the world are making heroic contributions
to fighting the pandemic, which has taken an especially high toll on
them. Many people have now heard of [Dr. Li
Wenliang](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/07/world/asia/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html),
the ophthalmologist who tried to warn the medical community in Wuhan as
the new coronavirus first started to make its way through the population
and was taken into custody by the police for “spreading false rumors.”
His death, on Feb. 7, caused an outpouring of anger and grief in China
and elsewhere. The disease claimed the lives of at least three other
physicians at Li’s hospital alone.

On March 18, Dr. Marcello Natali, who helped lead the response in
Codogno, the center of the Covid-19 pandemic in Northern Italy, died as
well, at a time when health care workers represented a significant
proportion of Italians stricken with the disease. Health care workers
are a society’s first line of defense, and many have been working long
hours with inadequate supplies, while dealing with the stressful
possibility of falling ill themselves, of infecting their families or of
spreading the virus to their patients. The rest of us owe you and your
co-workers a huge debt of gratitude — and a good way for us to show that
gratitude is by following the recommendations for social distancing and
staying at home whenever possible.

But heroes are not people who take unnecessary risks. They are people
who respond intelligently to a challenge, assessing the likelihoods of
hazards and benefits, and making a judgment about which chances are
worth taking. As Aristotle put it, courage means that you “endure or
fear the right things and for the right purpose and in the right manner
and at the right
time.”

So what’s the right purpose and manner for you at this time? Begin with
the fact that, as a doctor who has taken the Hippocratic oath, you have
assumed an ethically distinctive commitment: You’ve agreed to bear
certain risks necessary to the performance of your vocation. But you
won’t be of use to anyone if you get seriously ill. And as happened in
the early stages of the Wuhan outbreak, health care workers who aren’t
properly protected can themselves become significant sources of
infection.

Hospital systems, working with federal and state health officials, have
increasingly taken measures to try to keep staff members safe, including
the routine use of basic protection (masks, gloves), hand hygiene,
careful distancing and the like; using higher levels of protection when
dealing with certain patients or with respiratory procedures; asking
health care personnel with symptoms to stay home. Not a few hospitals
have been hampered by woefully inadequate supplies. But, I’m assured by
a professor at Harvard’s school of public health, these protocols, when
implemented, really do seem to work. As always in ethical life, facts
matter, and it’s incumbent on responsible people — and organizations —
to get the relevant facts right.

So your employers have an obligation to do their best to ensure, first,
that you and your colleagues have the resources needed to practice the
proper forms of hygiene; and second, that everyone in your system
rigorously adheres to the appropriate rules. That won’t bring the chance
of your getting ill down to zero, but concerted action and the right
equipment can keep it low. In urgent care (which involves cases that
need prompt attention but not E.R.-level interventions), you’ll
typically have time to approach newly arrived patients after a proper
assessment of the risks — a precaution important to their well-being and
to
yours.

You also have obligations, as you recognize, that are shaped not just by
your workplace responsibilities to colleagues and patients but also by
your ties to family and friends. That means (to repeat something that
bears repeating) observing social distancing and proper hand hygiene
away from work too. The real challenge for health care workers, as for
the rest of us, may be keeping your guard up over the weeks and months
ahead. But you may be able to help your colleagues here — perhaps by
letting them know that the stakes for you are higher than for most.

**A crisis like** this one brings out the ways in which we are all
united through a web of connections and thus of mutual responsibilities.
In the current circumstances, an untested person with a fever, dry cough
or unusual fatigue should assume she’s carrying and shedding the
coronavirus and practice self-isolation, as every responsible body of
experts has recommended. Even if your friend has the flu, she ought to
be concerned to limit its spread. Especially these days, we need to
avoid adding to the burden of an already overburdened health care
system.

Sadly, a majority of Americans failed to get vaccinated by February, a
date well into the flu season. If more had done so, we would have had
fewer hospitalizations and more resources at our disposal for this new
threat. People who don’t suffer much themselves from such infections can
spread them to those who
do.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Tell your friend that, as much as you love her, you think she should be
keeping herself away from others and that you’re going to delay the
dinner until you can both be sure she’s not contagious. She shouldn’t be
socializing with anyone, not just not with you. Help her to understand
that.

*After reading about how there’s a blood shortage as a result of
coronavirus, I went to a blood drive. It was the first time I’ve donated
in a few years, and I immediately remembered why. I’m a healthy
25-year-old with no medical or lifestyle factors that would prevent me
from donating, but the donation process takes about twice as long for me
as it does for everyone else. The nurse said my blood flow is weaker
than average and that my veins are uniquely hard to find. A nurse had to
stay by my side, continually readjusting the needle, while a backlog of
donors built up in the waiting area. My guess is that at least two other
people could have donated in the time I was there. I know that donating
blood is critical, especially during national emergencies, and for all I
know, the others could ultimately have been disqualified from donating.
Do you think the inconvenience of dealing with me outweighs the good I’m
doing?* Name Withheld

**If the time** it takes to collect your pint would really have reduced
the amount of blood collected at that site — maybe because the station
closed with people still waiting in line — you’d have reason to take a
pass. You might have asked the nurse or another blood-drive official
about this. But if you only created a minor hassle, well, someone has to
have the trickiest veins on a given day. Your donation expressed your
desire to contribute to the well-being of others. That’s valuable in
itself and something to give at least a little weight to. In these
individualist times, we should take the opportunity to remember that, as
St. Paul put it, we are “members one of another.” So thank you for
responding as you did.

*I live in a shared house with three other people. We are all employees
or graduate students at the university we graduated from last spring.
One of my housemates, with whom I also work, is planning to
self-quarantine in our apartment after a vacation to Spain, which she
took despite increased warnings about Covid-19 in the media and messages
from the university discouraging international travel.*

*I am in my 20s but have struggled with some moderate health issues; my
housemates and I also work with professors who are in their 70s. Can I
tell my housemate to quarantine elsewhere? Should the university provide
housing for one of us? Should I notify our boss?* Name Withheld

**Your housemate acted** irresponsibly. It’s her obligation to find a
place to quarantine herself without imposing risks on you. Ask her to do
so. If she can’t or won’t, ask your boss to let you stay out of town, if
you can, until she’s out of quarantine, or as you suggest, ask the
university to provide accommodations for one of you elsewhere. Either
way, you should practice social distancing with those septuagenarian
professors. Given their risk profile, they should certainly be grateful
— and grateful too that you took the initiative to do so.
