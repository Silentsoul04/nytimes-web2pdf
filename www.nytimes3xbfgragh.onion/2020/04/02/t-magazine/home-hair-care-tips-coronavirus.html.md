Because of [stay-at-home
orders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html)
and the closure of those businesses deemed nonessential, most, if not
all of us, are unlikely to see the inside of a hair salon in the near
future, which means taking matters into our own hands. But this period
can be used to repair heat-damaged tresses, learn styling techniques and
establish better habits for the future. **** Below, tips on how to ****
handle haircuts (spoiler: *don’t do it*) and maintain color at home.

### <span>Don’t Get Scissors-Happy</span>

Those with confidence in their hair cutting abilities can snip visible
split ends, says the Australian-born hair stylist [David
Mallett](https://david-mallett.com/en/salons/new-york/), in “brutally
clear light and trimming *less* than you think you have to — you have
the time to reassess and retrim.” But, he cautions, “this is not the
moment to try bangs for the first time, change the shape of your bangs
or cut sharp geometric ones.” If this advice comes too late, check out
the elevated hair accessories from the hairstylist turned jewelry
designer [Deborah
Pagani](https://deborahpagani.com/collections/hair-objet/), who makes
elegant pins and cuffs in precious metals, or the New Mexico-based
jewelry brand [Winden](https://www.windenjewelry.com/hair), which offers
playful acetate clips and combs.

### <span>Keep Up Color</span>

Emerging roots or brassy blond strands can be treated with home kits,
which are more comprehensive than ever. Maddison Cave, a colorist at
Mallett’s namesake salon in New York, likes Rita Hazan’s [Root Concealer
Touch-Up
Spray](https://ritahazan.com/products/root-concealer-color-spray)
because it’s easy to use and coats hair until the next shampooing. For a
longer-lasting option that will cover grays, the Parisian hair stylist
Christophe Robin created a [Temporary Color
Gel](https://www.sephora.com/product/temporary-color-gel-P434541?om_mmc=ppc-GG_6557108356_78386220443_dsa-446571741513__385631213750_9067609_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqvOL4bix6AIVCoTICh1w0AdoEAAYAiAAEgKIxPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&skuId=2132397),
an ultra-gentle treatment that is painted onto damp, shampooed hair and
left to sit for 40 minutes. After rinsing, grays appear more blended
into one’s base shade. The color begins to slowly fade after five
washes, so it’s perfect for those reluctant to commit to a permanent
color without the watchful eye of a stylist. For lighter hair in need of
toning, or any shade that could use some extra vibrancy, the hairstylist
Kristin Ess’s [Signature Hair
Gloss](https://www.target.com/p/kristin-ess-signature-hair-gloss-golden-hour/-/A-75564253)
seals and smooths hair cuticles to boost shine and lock in color. It
comes in a variety of shades, from light blond to dark brown, to add
just the right amount of warmth.

### <span>Limit the Damage</span>

When you’re overdue for a salon appointment, skipping a shampoo or two a
week — which, if you’re working from home, you might already be doing —
can help retain hair’s moisture and prevent color loss. To make fewer
washes count, apply Playa’s [Healing Hair
Masque](https://playabeauty.com/products/healing-hair-masque) after
shampooing, which contains scalp rebalancing kaolin clay, as well as
amla oil to strengthen strands and prevent premature fading. Using
hydrating treatments before and during styling can also protect
heat-damaged hair that usually benefits from restorative professional
treatments. For those with finely textured manes, look to the clean
beauty brand Rahua, which ethically sources many of its ingredients from
the Amazon rainforest. The line’s [Leave-In Treatment
Light](https://rahua.com/collections/styling/products/rahua-leave-in-treatment-light)
cream made from quinoa and Rahua oil — a nourishing ingredient extracted
from the ungurahua nut — is a practically weightless formula that can be
reapplied throughout the day.

For coarse and textured hair, Nancy Twine, the founder of the New
York-based beauty brand Briogeo, suggests massaging a mixture of castor
oil and the line’s new [Don’t Despair, Repair\! Strengthening Treatment
Oil](https://briogeohair.com/products/dont-despair-repair-strengthening-treatment-oil?flow_enabled=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI75KkzbTH6AIVDW6GCh0NJgsZEAQYASABEgLgEfD_BwE)
onto areas that are experiencing breakage before bedtime. The
strengthening oil is silicone-free and uses “fatty acid-packed oils to
nourish and feed the hair with true, healthy hydration, instead of
coating the hair with polymers to give the illusion of shine and
hydration,” Twine says. Virtue, a North Carolina-based hair-care brand
specializing in keratin-enriched products, also makes a [Split End
Serum](https://www.virtuelabs.com/en/perfect-ending-split-end-serum.html)
that can be used before blow-drying to seal broken ends.

### <span>Know Your Styling Options</span>

Though a professional blowout may not be in the cards, looking
presentable for a video conference can still be accomplished in a few
simple, time-efficient steps. To create soft waves without heat tools,
sleep with hair in a low coiled bun (Mallett suggests securing it with a
hair pin, like [this delicate hammered brass
pair](https://www.etsy.com/listing/594706250/set-of-2-gold-hair-pins-hammered-brass?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=hair+pin&ref=sr_gallery-1-4&organic_search_click=1&bes=1)
or [these vintage-inspired pastel
versions](https://www.jenny-walton.com/product-page/pastel-hair-pin),
and not an elastic, which can break hair when twisted tightly). If you
have shorter hair, or want a more defined wave, plait a crown braid
before showering at night, so that hair absorbs the humidity. Either
style can be brushed out in the morning, or simply left as is for an
equally polished Zoom-ready look. Video conferencing is also being used
as a tool to help with hair maintenance: For those who normally rely on
salon visits for braiding, [live, interactive
tutorials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/style/black-girl-women-hair-styling-live-tutorials-coronavirus.html)
are increasingly available online to guide you through the steps at
home. And for when you want to do as little as possible, a slicked-back
ponytail, smoothed using a wide boar-bristle brush, will help distribute
natural oils through the hair and extend time between washes. Toward the
end of the week, turning that ponytail into a low bun (using a touch of
[volume
powder](https://playabeauty.com/products/soft-volume-powder?variant=12731480014937&currency=USD&utm_source=adwords&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI85P64OXH6AIVi7bICh3IUwnCEAQYASABEgLiUPD_BwE),
if needed) can also help feign the composure you might not be feeling
after weeks spent inside.
