Professional advice on maintenance --- and Zoom-friendly styling --- for
when you can't get to a salon.

Because of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html}{stay-at-home
orders} and the closure of those businesses deemed nonessential, most,
if not all of us, are unlikely to see the inside of a hair salon in the
near future, which means taking matters into our own hands. But this
period can be used to repair heat-damaged tresses, learn styling
techniques and establish better habits for the future. **** Below, tips
on how to **** handle haircuts (spoiler: \emph{don't do it}) and
maintain color at home.

\hypertarget{dont-get-scissors-happy}{%
\subsubsection{Don't Get Scissors-Happy}\label{dont-get-scissors-happy}}

Those with confidence in their hair cutting abilities can snip visible
split ends, says the Australian-born hair stylist
\href{https://david-mallett.com/en/salons/new-york/}{David Mallett}, in
``brutally clear light and trimming \emph{less} than you think you have
to --- you have the time to reassess and retrim.'' But, he cautions,
``this is not the moment to try bangs for the first time, change the
shape of your bangs or cut sharp geometric ones.'' If this advice comes
too late, check out the elevated hair accessories from the hairstylist
turned jewelry designer
\href{https://deborahpagani.com/collections/hair-objet/}{Deborah
Pagani}, who makes elegant pins and cuffs in precious metals, or the New
Mexico-based jewelry brand
\href{https://www.windenjewelry.com/hair}{Winden}, which offers playful
acetate clips and combs.

\hypertarget{keep-up-color}{%
\subsubsection{Keep Up Color}\label{keep-up-color}}

Emerging roots or brassy blond strands can be treated with home kits,
which are more comprehensive than ever. Maddison Cave, a colorist at
Mallett's namesake salon in New York, likes Rita Hazan's
\href{https://ritahazan.com/products/root-concealer-color-spray}{Root
Concealer Touch-Up Spray} because it's easy to use and coats hair until
the next shampooing. For a longer-lasting option that will cover grays,
the Parisian hair stylist Christophe Robin created a
\href{https://www.sephora.com/product/temporary-color-gel-P434541?om_mmc=ppc-GG_6557108356_78386220443_dsa-446571741513__385631213750_9067609_c\&country_switch=us\&lang=en\&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqvOL4bix6AIVCoTICh1w0AdoEAAYAiAAEgKIxPD_BwE\&gclsrc=aw.ds\&skuId=2132397}{Temporary
Color Gel}, an ultra-gentle treatment that is painted onto damp,
shampooed hair and left to sit for 40 minutes. After rinsing, grays
appear more blended into one's base shade. The color begins to slowly
fade after five washes, so it's perfect for those reluctant to commit to
a permanent color without the watchful eye of a stylist. For lighter
hair in need of toning, or any shade that could use some extra vibrancy,
the hairstylist Kristin Ess's
\href{https://www.target.com/p/kristin-ess-signature-hair-gloss-golden-hour/-/A-75564253}{Signature
Hair Gloss} seals and smooths hair cuticles to boost shine and lock in
color. It comes in a variety of shades, from light blond to dark brown,
to add just the right amount of warmth.

\hypertarget{limit-the-damage}{%
\subsubsection{Limit the Damage}\label{limit-the-damage}}

When you're overdue for a salon appointment, skipping a shampoo or two a
week --- which, if you're working from home, you might already be doing
--- can help retain hair's moisture and prevent color loss. To make
fewer washes count, apply Playa's
\href{https://playabeauty.com/products/healing-hair-masque}{Healing Hair
Masque} after shampooing, which contains scalp rebalancing kaolin clay,
as well as amla oil to strengthen strands and prevent premature fading.
Using hydrating treatments before and during styling can also protect
heat-damaged hair that usually benefits from restorative professional
treatments. For those with finely textured manes, look to the clean
beauty brand Rahua, which ethically sources many of its ingredients from
the Amazon rainforest. The line's
\href{https://rahua.com/collections/styling/products/rahua-leave-in-treatment-light}{Leave-In
Treatment Light} cream made from quinoa and Rahua oil --- a nourishing
ingredient extracted from the ungurahua nut --- is a practically
weightless formula that can be reapplied throughout the day.

For coarse and textured hair, Nancy Twine, the founder of the New
York-based beauty brand Briogeo, suggests massaging a mixture of castor
oil and the line's new
\href{https://briogeohair.com/products/dont-despair-repair-strengthening-treatment-oil?flow_enabled=false\&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI75KkzbTH6AIVDW6GCh0NJgsZEAQYASABEgLgEfD_BwE}{Don't
Despair, Repair! Strengthening Treatment Oil} onto areas that are
experiencing breakage before bedtime. The strengthening oil is
silicone-free and uses ``fatty acid-packed oils to nourish and feed the
hair with true, healthy hydration, instead of coating the hair with
polymers to give the illusion of shine and hydration,'' Twine says.
Virtue, a North Carolina-based hair-care brand specializing in
keratin-enriched products, also makes a
\href{https://www.virtuelabs.com/en/perfect-ending-split-end-serum.html}{Split
End Serum} that can be used before blow-drying to seal broken ends.

\hypertarget{know-your-styling-options}{%
\subsubsection{Know Your Styling
Options}\label{know-your-styling-options}}

Though a professional blowout may not be in the cards, looking
presentable for a video conference can still be accomplished in a few
simple, time-efficient steps. To create soft waves without heat tools,
sleep with hair in a low coiled bun (Mallett suggests securing it with a
hair pin, like
\href{https://www.etsy.com/listing/594706250/set-of-2-gold-hair-pins-hammered-brass?ga_order=most_relevant\&ga_search_type=all\&ga_view_type=gallery\&ga_search_query=hair+pin\&ref=sr_gallery-1-4\&organic_search_click=1\&bes=1}{this
delicate hammered brass pair} or
\href{https://www.jenny-walton.com/product-page/pastel-hair-pin}{these
vintage-inspired pastel versions}, and not an elastic, which can break
hair when twisted tightly). If you have shorter hair, or want a more
defined wave, plait a crown braid before showering at night, so that
hair absorbs the humidity. Either style can be brushed out in the
morning, or simply left as is for an equally polished Zoom-ready look.
Video conferencing is also being used as a tool to help with hair
maintenance: For those who normally rely on salon visits for braiding,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/style/black-girl-women-hair-styling-live-tutorials-coronavirus.html}{live,
interactive tutorials} are increasingly available online to guide you
through the steps at home. And for when you want to do as little as
possible, a slicked-back ponytail, smoothed using a wide boar-bristle
brush, will help distribute natural oils through the hair and extend
time between washes. Toward the end of the week, turning that ponytail
into a low bun (using a touch of
\href{https://playabeauty.com/products/soft-volume-powder?variant=12731480014937\&currency=USD\&utm_source=adwords\&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI85P64OXH6AIVi7bICh3IUwnCEAQYASABEgLiUPD_BwE}{volume
powder}, if needed) can also help feign the composure you might not be
feeling after weeks spent inside.
