\textbf{Gail Bichler, design director:} ``This week's cover story
features 20 workers --- grocery store clerks, postal workers and
paramedics among them --- from the front lines of the coronavirus
pandemic. Because of safety concerns, we did not assign a photographer
to capture these workers, who expose themselves to harm as others
quarantine indoors, and instead asked them to submit photos, which we've
scattered across the cover.''
