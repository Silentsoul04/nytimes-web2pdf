\textbf{Dana writes:} \emph{Our kids really wanted the big Lego Hogwarts
set. So my husband and I bought it, planning to stash it away until they
saved enough money to pay for it. It's four months later, and they
haven't saved any money. But now we're sheltering in place. I suggested
that Lego Hogwarts could be deployed in case of emergency boredom. His
response? ``They'd better start saving money.''}

First of all, I hope you are all safe and healthy. Even your husband. I
also hope by now your husband has agreed, either by reason of decency or
claustrophobia, to let the Lego bricks fly. It is very difficult right
now for anyone to make money, never mind children who are forced to earn
their toys. Kindness, patience and productive distraction are as vital
right now as paid sick leave, stimulus checks and rent forgiveness. I
use my executive powers to vote for an immediate Lego bailout.
