*With the New York gala circuit on hiatus because of the coronavirus
outbreak, here is how some patrons and society figures are spending
their time — and money — while self-isolated. (Interviews have been
edited.)*

## Larry Milstein

**Age**: 25

**Occupation**: founder of PRZM, a Gen Z consulting firm; philanthropist

**Favorite charities:** World Health Organization’s [Covid-19 Solidarity
Response
Fund](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate),
[International Medical Corps](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/)

**Where are you hunkering down?** At my family home in Long Island.

**What do you miss most from your pre-Covid life?** I live in Manhattan.
Being at the epicenter of this global crisis is particularly
disheartening. New York is a place always pulsing with energy. To feel
that energy drained is so antithetical to what the city is.

**Have you looked for novel ways to compensate?** It occurred to me that
we needed to be doing more than sending out love and thoughts. We needed
to be creating a sense of community, raising funds and offering critical
resources. So we tried to come up with a creative solution to replicate
the sense of a charity event.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Can you describe it?** We introduced the first ever Zoom gala. The
idea was to use a digital platform for fund-raising, to foster a sense
of social connection while doing good. Unlike Instagram Live, you could
actually see the other attendees.

They included some of our committee members, people like Paul Arnhold,
Danielle Lauder and Satchel Lee, Spike Lee’s daughter. We wanted to give
guests the chance to feel their best, whether it was wearing their
finest pair of sweats or rocking an awesome party outfit.

**What were some highlights of that event?**

We had Ty Sunderland as a D.J. Cheat Codes and Anna of the North
performed.

**Have your efforts paid off?**

We raised $5,000 in less than 24 hours since announcing this party on
Tuesday night, and more than $20,000 overall. We asked for small
grass-roots donations: $25 as a base fee, but people could donate more,
or less. We wanted this to feel accessible and diverse in a way a formal
seated black-tie dinner could never be.

**How are you spending your downtime?**

I’ve been binge-watching TV. I’m midway through “The Tiger King.” And,
like a lot of Americans right now, I’m baking banana bread.

## Jill Kargman

**Age**: 45

**Occupation**: writer and actress

**Favorite charity:** [River Fund](https://www.river.fund/)

**Where is she hunkering down?** In her apartment building on the Upper
East Side.

**What’s keeping you in the city?** I don’t have a country house. And I
feel safest in New York. I think I would go crazy hearing crickets.

**Please take us through your day.** I think of reading the paper as a

as sexy before. But now, he’s hot.

**What else are you doing?** I’ve made a quarantine vlog, if you will,
based on a character resurrected from a show I did in Williamstown;
later it moved to the Carlyle. I’ve called my character
[Dzanielle](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17856598183860833/?hl=en).
She lives on Instagram as a caricature of Upper East Side moms grappling
with the traumas of canceled SoulCycle classes and visible roots.

you see on Instagram. More often we’re all piled up on my bed watching
reruns of “Game of Thrones.”

**What about charity work?** I’ve just donated to the River Fund, an
organization in Queens set up to fight hunger and poverty. In the same
way there is triage in the hospital intake room, there is going to be
some philanthropic triage. People will have to prioritize. Your food
insecurity will be first. You’re not going to be thinking about the
American Friends of some international

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

**And your writing?** Everyone asks, “What are you working on?” That
makes me feel pressured, like I have to turn out a masterpiece. People
are always reminding you, “Shakespeare wrote ‘King Lear’ when he was
under plague quarantine.” But Shakespeare didn’t have three kids
whining, “What are we having for
dinner?”

**Is there an upside to self-isolation?** Just being together as a
family is nice. My husband and two daughters have breakfast, lunch and
dinner together every single day. I keep reading all these statistics
about how divorce rates are soaring. I think this seclusion has been
great for our marriage.

**What’s your secret to keeping calm? And connected?** We have Post
Morrow, a beautiful nature preserve, near our house. We go there on lots
of long walks. I’m also rewatching all my favorite Disney classics on
Disney+. I’ve gotten to see “Snow White,” “Sleeping Beauty,”
“Cinderella” and “Alice in Wonderland.” I’m using the Houseparty
app, which is quite fun. You can share your screen. It’s like bringing a
bunch of your friends into your room.

**What do you miss?** I never thought I would say this, but I miss
jumping on the subway to get to meetings. I miss going into a cafe and
actually being able to sit down and check a few emails

**Who’s been cleaning your house?** Um, me. (chuckles)

**Is that a challenge?** Yes.

**How are you keeping up your charitable contributions?** The Hilton
foundation has donated over $10 million to coronavirus relief efforts.
During April I am donating 20 percent of my Nicky Hilton x French Sole
shoe sales to the LifeWay Network’s Covid-19 Freedom Fund, which assists
human trafficking survivors.

**How do you envision life post-Covid?** I’m not upset that we can’t
shake hands anymore. I think we’re going to just throw that out
completely. We have become very touchy as a society; it’s not necessary.
We’ll be seeing the world through a new set of eyes and not taking basic
things for granted anymore.
