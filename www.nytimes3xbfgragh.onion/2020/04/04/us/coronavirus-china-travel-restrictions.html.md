# 430,000 People Have Traveled From China to U.S. Since Coronavirus Surfaced

</div>

There were 1,300 direct flights to 17 cities before President Trump’s
travel restrictions. Since then, nearly 40,000 Americans and other
authorized travelers have made the trip, some this past week and many
with spotty screening.

Since Chinese officials
[disclosed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html)
the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonialike illness to international
health officials on New Year’s Eve, at least 430,000 people have arrived
in the United States on direct flights from
[China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/world/asia/coronavirus-china-nationalism.html),
including nearly 40,000 in the two months after President Trump imposed
restrictions on such
[travel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/travel/q-and-a-coronavirus-travel.html),
according to an analysis of data collected in both countries.

The bulk of the passengers, who were of multiple nationalities, arrived
in January, at airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York,
Chicago, Seattle, Newark and Detroit. Thousands of them flew directly
from Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, as American public
health officials were only beginning to assess the risks to the United
States.

Flights continued this past week, the data show, with passengers
traveling from Beijing to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York,
[under rules that exempt Americans and some
others](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/)
from the clampdown that took effect on Feb. 2. In all, 279 flights from
China have arrived in the United States since then, and screening
procedures have been uneven, interviews show.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested that his
[travel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/travel/q-and-a-coronavirus-travel.html)
measures impeded the virus’s spread in the United States. “I do think we
were very early, but I also think that we were very smart, because we
stopped China,” he said at a briefing on Tuesday, adding, “That was
probably the biggest decision we made so far.” Last month, he said,
“We’re the ones that kept China out of here.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the analysis of the flight and other data by The New York Times
shows the travel measures, however effective, may have come too late to
have “kept China out,” particularly in light of [recent statements from
health
officials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html)
that as many as 25 percent of people infected with the virus may never
show symptoms. Many infectious-disease experts suspect that the virus
had been spreading undetected for weeks after the first American case
was confirmed, [in Washington State, on
Jan. 20](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191), and that
it had continued to be introduced. In fact, no one knows when the virus
first arrived in the United States.

During the first half of January, [when Chinese officials were
underplaying the severity of the
outbreak,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html)
no travelers from China were screened for potential exposure to the
virus. Health screening began in mid-January, but only for a number of
travelers who had been in Wuhan and only at the airports in Los Angeles,
San Francisco and New York. By that time, about 4,000 people had already
entered the United States directly from Wuhan, according to VariFlight,
an aviation data company based in China. The measures were expanded to
all passengers from China two weeks later.

In a statement on Friday, Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman,
described Mr. Trump’s travel restrictions as a “bold decisive action
which medical professionals say will prove to have saved countless
lives.” The policy took effect, he said, at a time when the global
health community did not yet “know the level of transmission or
asymptomatic spread.”

Trump administration officials have also said they received significant
pushback about imposing the restrictions even when they did. At the
time, the World Health Organization [was not
recommending](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-\(2005\)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-\(2019-ncov\))
travel restrictions, Chinese officials [rebuffed
them](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1739548.shtml)
and some scientists
[questioned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html)
whether curtailing travel would do any good. Some Democrats in Congress
said they could lead to
discrimination.

“I was surprised at how lax the whole process was,” said Andrew Wu, 31,

on March 10. “The guy I spoke to read down a list of questions, and he
didn’t seem interested in checking out

Sabrina Fitch, 23, flew from China to Kennedy International Airport in
New York on March 23. She and the 40 or so other passengers had their
temperature taken twice while en route and were required to fill out
forms about their travels and health, she said.

“Besides looking at our passports, they didn’t question us like we
normally are questioned,” said Ms. Fitch, who had been teaching English
in China. “So it was kind of weird, because everyone expected the
opposite, where you get a lot of questions. But once we filled out the
little health form, no one really cared.”

In January, before the broad screening was in place, there were over
1,300 direct passenger flights from China to the United States,
according to VariFlight and two American firms, MyRadar and FlightAware.
About 381,000 travelers flew directly from China to the United States
that month, about a quarter of whom were American, **** according to
data from the Department of Commerce’s International Trade
Administration.

In addition, untold others arrived from China on itineraries that first
stopped in another country. While actual passenger counts for indirect
fliers were not available, Sofia Boza-Holman, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Homeland Security, said they represented about a quarter
of travelers from China. The restrictions, she added, reduced all
passengers from the country by about 99 percent.

Mr. Trump issued his first travel restrictions related to the virus on
Jan. 31, one day after the World Health Organization declared the
outbreak a global health emergency. In a presidential proclamation, he
barred foreign nationals from entering the country if they had been in
China during the prior two weeks. The order exempted American citizens,
green-card holders and their noncitizen relatives — exceptions roundly
recognized as necessary to allow residents to return home and prevent
families from being separated. It did not apply to flights from Hong
Kong and Macau.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

About 60 percent of travelers on direct flights from China in February
were not American citizens, according to the most recently available
government data. Most of the flights were operated by Chinese airlines
after American carriers halted theirs.

At a news conference about the restrictions, Alex M. Azar II, the health
secretary, repeatedly emphasized that “the risk is low” for Americans.
He added, “Our job is to work to keep that that way.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

Health officials also announced an expansion of the screening beyond
arrivals from Wuhan. Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, explained that people would be screened
for “significant risk, as well as any evidence of symptoms.” If there
was no reason for additional examination, “they would be allowed to
complete their travel back to their home, where they then will be
monitored by the local health departments in a self-monitoring situation
in their home.”

The procedures called for screening to be conducted in empty sections of
the airports, usually past customs areas. Passengers would line up and
spend a minute or two having their temperature taken and being asked
about their health and travel history. Those with a fever or
self-reported symptoms like a cough would get a medical evaluation, and
if they were thought to have been infected or exposed to the virus, they
would be sent to a hospital where local health officials would take
over.

Passengers would also be given information cards about the virus and
symptoms. Later versions advised people to stay at home for two weeks.

In a statement on Thursday, the C.D.C. described the entry screening as
“part of a layered approach” that could “slow and reduce the spread of
disease” when used with other public health measures.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We cannot stop all introductions,” the C.D.C. added, noting that the
coronavirus pandemic was “especially challenging due to asymptomatic and
presymptomatic infections and an incubation period of up to two weeks.”

Separately, on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a
statement that the administration’s measures were “unprecedented” and
allowed “the U.S. to stay ahead of the outbreak as it developed.”

Passengers including Mr. Wu described a cursory screening process when
they arrived in the United States.

Mr. Wu, who has had no symptoms and has not become ill, said he was told
to stay inside for 14 days when he landed in Los Angeles. He said he
received two reminder messages the next day by email and text, but no
further follow-up.

Another traveler, Chandler Jurinka, said his experience on Feb. 29 had
an even more haphazard feel. He flew from Beijing to Seattle, with stops
in Tokyo and Vancouver.

At the Seattle-Tacoma airport, he said, an immigration officer went
through his documents and asked questions unrelated to the virus about
his job and life in China. At no point did anyone take his temperature,
he said.

“He hands me my passport and forms and says, ‘Oh, by the way, you
haven’t been to Wuhan, have you?’” Mr. Jurinka said. “And then he
says, ‘You don’t have a fever, right?’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like others, he left the airport with a card that recommended two weeks
of self-quarantine and a promise that someone would call to check up on
him. He said he never got a call.

Other travelers also said the follow-up from local health departments
was hit-or-miss. Some received only emails or texts.

Jacinda Passmore, 23, a former English teacher in China who flew into
Dallas on March 10, after a layover in Tokyo, got a thorough screening
at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. It took about 40 minutes, she said,
before she was cleared for her flight home to Little Rock, Ark.

State health workers later dropped off thermometers at her house and
insisted her entire family stay home for two weeks and provide updates
on their condition.

“They asked us every day: ‘Have you stayed inside? Have you met anyone?
Have you been quarantined?’” Ms. Passmore said. “They’re really nice
about it. They said, ‘If you need anything, we can go grocery-shopping
for you.’”

Nineteen flights departed Wuhan in January for New York or San Francisco
— and the flights were largely full, according to VariFlight. For about
4,000 travelers, there was no enhanced screening.

On Jan. 17, the federal government [began screening
travelers](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0117-coronavirus-screening.html)
from Wuhan, but only 400 more passengers arrived on direct flights
before Chinese authorities shut down the airport. Scott Liu, 56, a Wuhan
native and a textile importer who lives in New York, caught the last
commercial flight, on Jan. 22.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Liu had gone to Wuhan for the Spring Festival on Jan. 6, but decided
to come back early as the outbreak worsened. At the Wuhan airport, staff
checked his temperature. On the flight, he and other passengers filled a
health declaration form, which included questions about symptoms like
fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

After they arrived at J.F.K. in New York, the passengers were directed
to go through a temperature checkpoint. “It was very fast,” he said. “If
your temperature is normal, they will just let you in.”

Mr. Liu said no one asked him questions about his travel history or
health, and he received a card with information about what to do if he
developed symptoms. At the time, there were no instructions to isolate.
Mr. Liu said he and his friends all decided to do so anyway.
