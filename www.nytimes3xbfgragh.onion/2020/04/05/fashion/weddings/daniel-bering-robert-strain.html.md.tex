Daniel Richardson Bering and Robert Marshall Strain were married April 4
on a walking trail at the Thornton State Beach in Daly City, Calif.
Heather Smith, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life
Minister for the occasion, officiated. The couple had originally planned
to wed at the Hotel Peter and Paul in New Orleans before the Centers for
Disease Control recommended that events with 50 or more be postponed.
They plan to have a reception there Nov. 22.

Mr. Bering (left), 32, is a project manager at Lyra Management, a family
office in San Francisco, where he focuses on managing events and home
renovations. He graduated from Connecticut College in New London, Conn.,
and received a postgraduate diploma in history of art from Christie's
Education in London and the University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland.

He is a son of Marilyn Richardson Bering and Charles C. Bering of
Watertown, Mass. Mr. Bering's mother is an arts consultant and
specialist in the work of the black 19th-century sculptor Edmonia Lewis.
His father retired as a senior staff counsel in the law division of the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. He also has a private practice
in environmental law in Watertown. The groom's paternal
great-grandfather, Winthrop W. Aldrich, was a chairman of the Chase Bank
and an ambassador to the Court of St. James's under President
Eisenhower.

Mr. Strain, 33, is the founder of a consulting practice that focuses on
helping schools and educators create learning experiences and new
innovation. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of
Pennsylvania.

He is the son of Karen A. Strain and Robert D. Strain Jr. of
Westminster, Colo. Mr. Strain's mother is a stay-at-home parent. His
father is the president of Ball Aerospace, a company that manufactures
spacecraft, components, and instruments for the U.S. government, in
Broomfield, Colo.

The couple, who met through the dating app Tinder in 2016 in San
Francisco, plan to spend the month of April celebrating their nuptials
with family and friends, virtually, using Zoom video conferencing. They
will host a series of eight virtual happy hours, where they have asked
their wedding guests to wear a ``snazzy outfit and make a signature
cocktail'' for the cocktail-style events.

``We wanted to maintain the spirit of bringing together the people we
love the most and celebrating with our community,'' said Mr. Strain. Mr.
Bering added: ``We were fortunate to have a lot of support from our
family, friends and our wedding planner and vendors in New Orleans.
Postponing our wedding kind of turned into our second engagement.''
