Jamie Hannah Fishkin and Seth Eric Faber were married April 4 at the
house of the groom's parents in Great Neck, N.Y. Rabbi Lisa Rubin
officiated. The couple had originally planned to wed at the Garden City
Hotel in Garden City, N.Y., before the Centers for Disease Control
recommended that events with 50 or more be postponed. They plan to have
another ceremony there July 11.

The bride and groom, both 26, graduated from the University of Maryland,
College Park.

Mrs. Faber is an account manager in New York at Good2bSocial, a digital
marketing agency.

She is a daughter of Stephanie Propos-Fishkin and Robert A. Fishkin of
New York. The bride's father is the managing lawyer of the New York City
staff counsel office at MetLife in New York. Her mother, also a lawyer,
is a claims consultant in lawyers professional liability in the New York
office at the insurance company CNA.

Mr. Faber is a brand strategy supervisor in New York at Horizon Media, a
media advertising agency.

He is the son of Meryl Faber and Steven A. Faber of Great Neck. Until
2012 the groom's mother was the office manager at the I. Hyman
Corporation, which was a family-run corporate furniture and furnishing
sales representative in Great Neck. His father is based there as an
independent sales representative for several apparel and accessory
companies in New York.

The couple have known each other since they were toddlers in a playgroup
for 2-year-olds in Great Neck (the bride's parents lived there until
last year), but drifted apart as they got older. This changed in 2010
after Mr. Faber asked Ms. Fishkin to the William A. Shine Great Neck
South High School junior prom, and she said yes.
