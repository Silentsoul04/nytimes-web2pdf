MADRID — At the end of January, a German tourist became
[Spain’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/world/europe/coronavirus-covid-spain-second-wave.html)
first
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-reopening.html)
patient. At the time, the health threat seemed for the nation as remote
as the tiny Spanish island of La Gomera, where he was treated. Two weeks
later, the German walked out of hospital, and Spain celebrated being
again “[virus
free](https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20200215/473560105026/espana-coronavirus-libre-alta-casos-registrados.html).”

It proved a very brief respite. But even as more cases surfaced, Spanish
officials continued to stress that the coronavirus was being imported,
notably onto another island by[tourists from
Italy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/world/europe/spain-coronavirus.html),
where hospitals were already under siege. The story line was that Spain
faced an external threat, but did not risk a domestic epidemic.

But then on Feb. 26, a resident of Seville, who had not done any
[traveling](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/positivo-coronavirus-Sevilla-contagio-Espana_0_999850843.html),
tested positive. A week later, another man in the region of Valencia
became Spain’s first coronavirus victim, starting a grim count that is
approaching 14,000 dead. Spain now ranks second in the world, behind the
United States, in total number of cases.

Spain’s crisis has demonstrated that one symptom of the virus, by now as
persistent as the fevers, aches and labored breathing it brings, has
been the tendency of one government after another to ignore the

Starting with China, the virus has skipped across the globe, crossing
the threshold of one million infections worldwide last week. But as in
most nations, the Spanish authorities initially treated the virus as an
external threat, rather than considering that their country could be the
next domino to fall.

The epidemic has now forced Spaniards to confront the kind of struggle
that could be recalled only by those old enough to have lived through
the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s.

Health care unions are taking the authorities to court for not
[protecting

more of their members have been infected in Spain than anywhere else in
the world, sometimes even forcing doctors and nurses to use garbage bags
in place of medical gowns. Patients have been sleeping in hospital
corridors.

In Madrid, the country’s largest skating rink became an emergency morgue
while its main exhibition center was turned into a field hospital, which
opened in what health unions described as disastrous [work

In one of the most gruesome episodes in this crisis, Spanish soldiers
found older residents abandoned or dead in their [nursing home
beds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/world/europe/Spain-coronavirus-nursing-homes.html).

“It’s been shocking for a society to face a situation only known to
those who remember Spain coming out of the war,” said Cristina Monge, a
professor of sociology at the University of Zaragoza. For many others,
she added, “this kind of scenario was until now pure science
fiction.”

As a result, the government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has faced
criticism for not prohibiting mass gatherings sooner, and for not
stockpiling medical equipment as soon as the number of cases reached
several hundred in northern Italy in late
February.

Spanish officials have defended their actions by highlighting the
shortcomings of other nations, and there is no doubt that Spain has
company in its tragedy. But the progress of the virus in Spain has not
been forgiving of the government’s response.

Even as Italy [locked down its northern regions on
March 8](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/08/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-quarantine.html),
Spain’s first coronavirus
[cluster](https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-03-06/mas-de-60-personas-se-contagiaron-a-la-vez-en-un-funeral-en-vitoria.html)had
already emerged among participants of a funeral service. Mr. Sánchez’s
government did not put the country under the highest [level of
alert](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-emergency.html)
and impose a nationwide lockdown until March 14.

*\[Analysis:* [*Peaks, testing and lockdowns: How coronavirus vocabulary
causes
confusion*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/world/europe/coronavirus-language-confusion.html)*.\]*

Opposition politicians have since charged that it was too late. “Late in
comparison with which countries?” Prime Minister Sánchez challenged
lawmakers in Congress.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Italy, Britain and France, he noted, declared their own lockdowns only
once they had more infections than Spain. He stressed that International
Women’s Day, when 120,000 gathered in Madrid on March 8, had also been
celebrated on the streets of Brussels, Berlin, Vienna and Paris.

The event has widely been blamed for catapulting the spread of the virus
in the capital. Three Spanish government ministers who led the women’s
rally later tested positive for the virus, as did Mr. Sánchez’s wife and
mother.

“It is evident that with what we know today, all of us would have acted
differently,” Mr. Sánchez said.

No doubt, the government’s response to the virus was complicated by the
diffuse nature of Spain’s political system, in which the country’s 17
regions progressively gained more autonomy, including the management of
hospitals, after Spain adopted a new Constitution in
1978.

It also did not help that the emergency was foisted on a new and fragile
coalition government, Spain’s first. Mr. Sánchez barely scraped into
office in January, after an inconclusive national election, and his
Socialists now share power with their erstwhile rivals, the far-left
Unidas Podemos party.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The coalition partners bickered over how much financial support Spain
could afford to give to those left idle if ordered to stay home. By the
time Mr. Sánchez declared a national lockdown, several regional
politicians had already announced their own clampdown measures.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The gap between regional and national decision-making also encouraged
many wealthy Madrid residents to hurry to their [seaside
homes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/29/world/europe/rich-coronavirus-second-homes.html?searchResultPosition=1&fbclid=IwAR0YsBYnhBLvSmo73JjCjfG73mNYyFpq6eCF_KCZQSzumlZa0v7yK6y2ORA),
once all Madrid schools had been shut, at the risk of further spreading
a virus that was already firmly embedded in Spain’s capital.

“A new and fragmented government starts with a huge disadvantage in this
kind of crisis situation, because it requires quick and forceful
decisions to be taken without constantly worrying about whether somebody
else is gaining a political advantage,” said Toni Roldán, a Spanish
economist and former lawmaker from the Ciudadanos party.

As a measure of the difficulties, Quim Torra, the separatist leader in
northeastern Catalonia, refused even to sign a joint declaration with
Madrid on coordinating the lockdown with the national government.

Fernando Rodríguez Artalejo, an epidemiologist and university professor,
said Spain should not be judged harshly over its response to a pandemic
that every government had passively watched unfold in a neighboring
country “as if watching a movie.”

Spain watched Italy, he acknowledged, but with the mitigating factor
that many scientists believed until recently that asymptomatic people
were probably not contagious.

“The idea was that the authorities just needed to track the cases and
identify the people whom they had been in contact with,” he said. “This
doctrine is now gone, but too late for Spain.”

Even so, Spain’s main neighbor has fared much better so far. Despite
sharing a 750-mile border with Spain, Portugal passed 200 coronavirus
deaths last week just as Spain reached 10,000.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There, another Socialist minority government leader, Prime Minister
António Costa, has seen opposition politicians close ranks behind him.
Mr. Costa has been warning that Portugal could face more pain, but Dr.
Rodríguez Artalejo said that Portugal so far deserved
admiration.

        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

The same solidarity has been sorely missing in Spain. As Madrid
accounted for half of the nationwide death toll, Salvador Illa, the
health minister, made “a call for solidarity with the Madrid region.”

But that did not lead to a significant shift of medical equipment from
other regions, nor was there any follow-up on his suggestion that Madrid
patients could be moved to less affected regions.

By contrast, France’s government has been evacuating some patients by
[high-speed
train](https://www.france24.com/en/20200326-france-stages-first-train-evacuation-of-coronavirus-patients)
from Paris and other saturated regions.

“I think each region has acted independently, and that makes any
coordination or solidarity initiative very difficult,” said Carlos Rus,
the president of ASPE, an association that represents Spain’s private
hospitals.

The procurement of emergency equipment has been especially dire. The
problem was highlighted when the health ministry acquired, via an
undisclosed Spanish intermediary, 640,000 test kits from a Chinese
company whose initial shipment proved unusable.

“We are working within a robust and large health care system that
unfortunately gets slowed down by plenty of bureaucracy, including when
it comes to buying anything,” said Ángela Hernández Puente, a doctor and
labor union official in Madrid.

The coronavirus has spurred a worldwide debate about how each government
measures its impact, particularly since many countries have done minimal
testing for the virus. Governments have also differed in how they count
their coronavirus dead, for instance by ignoring those who never entered
a hospital.

But even amid such confusion, Spain’s testing regime has been opaque.

Guadalupe Moreno, who works for Statista, a German data company, said
she considered Spain’s testing data to be too incomplete to feature in
her comparative research.

“It seems that the Spanish authorities are themselves no longer clear
about how many tests are being conducted in Spain,” she said.

Even so, about 15 percent of Spain’s population is estimated to already
have been infected — by far the highest proportion among 11 European
countries included in a [recent
study](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf)
by scientists from Imperial College London.

The biggest victims of the confused response, beyond those left sickened
or dead by the virus, are Spain’s doctors and nurses, who themselves
have been infected in staggering numbers.

They have received an outpouring of solidarity and daily applause from
the balconies of Spain’s 47 million confined residents, the vast
majority of whom have respected a strict lockdown that will last until
at least April 26.

“This crisis is likely to strengthen the horizontal bonds in our
society, between citizens who are making big sacrifices, while weakening
further the vertical one with the leadership at the top,” forecast
Narciso Michavila, a sociologist and the president of GD3, a Spanish
polling firm.

Damage from the distrust may already have been done. In one of his
company’s recent surveys, published in the newspaper ABC, almost
two-thirds of people accused the government of [hiding
information](https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-cada-tres-espanoles-creen-gobierno-esta-ocultando-informacion-202003300248_noticia.html)about
the epidemic.

“No politician can be held responsible for creating this crisis,’’ Mr.
Michavila said. “But some probably will be blamed for pouring oil rather
than using a bucket of water to put out the fire.”
