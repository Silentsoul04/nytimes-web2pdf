Crates of masks snatched from cargo planes on airport tarmacs. Countries
paying triple the market price to outbid others. [Accusations of “modern
piracy”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/business/economy/peter-navarro-coronavirus-defense-production-act.html)
against governments trying to secure medical supplies for their own
people.

As the United States and European Union countries compete to acquire
scarce medical equipment to combat the coronavirus, another troubling
divide is also emerging, with poorer countries losing out to wealthier
ones in the global scrum for masks and testing materials.

Scientists in Africa and Latin America have been told by manufacturers
that orders for vital testing kits cannot be filled for months, because
the supply chain is in upheaval and almost everything they produce is
going to America or Europe. All countries report steep price increases,
from testing kits to masks.

The huge global demand for masks, alongside new distortions in the
private market, has forced some developing countries to turn to UNICEF
for help. Etleva Kadilli, who oversees supplies at the agency, said it
was trying to buy 240 million masks to help 100 countries but so far had
managed to source only around 28 million.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There is a war going on behind the scenes, and we’re most worried about
poorer countries losing out,” said Dr. Catharina Boehme, the chief
executive of Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, which
[collaborates](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/10-02-2020-who-and-find-formalize-strategic-collaboration-to-drive-universal-access-to-essential-diagnostics)
with the World Health Organization in helping poorer countries gain
access to medical tests.

In Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia, many countries are already
at a disadvantage, with health systems that are underfunded, fragile and
often lacking in necessary equipment. A [recent
study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4305307/) found that
some poor countries have only one equipped intensive care bed per
million residents.

So far, the developing world has reported far fewer cases and deaths
from the coronavirus, but many experts fear that the pandemic could be
especially devastating for the poorest countries.

Testing is the first defense against the virus and an important tool to
stop so many patients from ending up hospitalized. Most manufacturers
want to help, but the niche industry that produces the testing equipment
and chemical reagents necessary to process lab tests is dealing with
huge global demand.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There’s never really been a shortage of chemical reagents before now,”
said Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of the British In Vitro
Diagnostics Association, which represents producers and distributors of
the lab tests used to detect coronavirus. “If it was just one country
with an epidemic it would be fine, but all the major countries in the
world are wanting the same thing at the same
time.”

For poorer countries, Dr. Boehme said the competition for resources is
potentially a “global catastrophe,” as a once-coherent supply chain has
rapidly devolved into an arm-twisting exercise. Leaders of “every
country” are personally calling manufacturing chief executives to demand
first-in-line access to vital supplies. Some governments have even
offered to send private jets.

In Brazil, Amilcar Tanuri cannot offer private jets. Dr. Tanuri runs
public laboratories at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, half of
which are “stuck doing nothing,” instead of testing health workers,
because he said the chemical reagents he needs are being routed to
wealthier countries.

“If you don’t have reliable tests, you are blind,” he said. “This is the
beginning of the epidemic curve so I’m very concerned about the public
health system here being overwhelmed very fast.”

Brazil is Latin America’s hardest hit country so far, with more than
[10,000 confirmed
cases](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)
and a [testing backlog of at
least 23,000](https://brazilian.report/coronavirus-brazil-live-blog/2020/04/02/over-23000-still-brazilians-await-covid-19-test-results/).
It is also the region’s most controversial player in the pandemic, with
a president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has been an outspoken skeptic of the
risks posed by the
coronavirus.

But below the political noise, the country’s scientists began trying to
ramp up testing hours after the country’s first case was announced.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Yet within weeks, Dr. Tanuri was left to frantically call private firms
on three continents, trying to source the chemical reagents needed for
the 200 testing samples his labs receive every day — only to be told
that the United States and Europe had already bought up months of
production.

“If we purchase something to arrive in 60 days, it’s too late,” he said.
“The virus goes faster than we can go.”

The situation is similar for some African countries.

After reporting its [first
death](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus.html)
on March 27, South Africa moved swiftly, introducing a strict lockdown
and announcing ambitious house-to-house canvassing that has already seen
47,000 people tested. South Africa has [more than 200 public
labs](https://nationalgovernment.co.za/units/view/251/national-health-laboratory-service-nhls),
an impressive network that surpasses wealthier countries like Britain
and was developed in response to past outbreaks of H.I.V. and
tuberculosis.

But, like Brazil, it is reliant on international manufacturers for the
chemical reagents, and other equipment, needed to process the tests. Dr.
Francois Venter, an infectious diseases expert who is advising the South
African government, said the struggle to acquire the reagents was
endangering the country’s overall response.

“We have the capacity to do large testing, but we’ve been bedeviled by
the fact the actual testing materials, reagents, haven’t been coming,”
he said. “We’re not as wealthy. We don’t have as many ventilators, we
don’t have as many doctors, our health system was in a precarious
position before coronavirus.”

“The country is terrified,” he added.

To address the problem, South Africa’s National Health Laboratory
Services has set up a “war room” of around 20 people who are
continuously calling different suppliers — yet running into problems
sourcing the test kits and protective equipment they
need.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

“Manufacturers don’t just want to sell to rich countries,” said Paul
Molinaro, head of supply and logistics for the World Health
Organization. “They want to diversify, but they’ve got all this
competing demand from different governments.”

He added: “When it comes to the sharp end of a hypercompetitive
environment with price rises, these low- and middle-income countries are
going to end up at the back of the queue.”

Last week, President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to
prohibit the export of face masks to other countries and demand that
American firms increase production of medical supplies.

One American company that makes masks, 3M, responded by warning of
“significant humanitarian implications” if it stopped supplying masks
to Latin America and Canada. This week, the company and the Trump
administration reached a
[deal](https://news.3m.com/blog/3m-stories/3m-and-trump-administration-announce-plan-import-1665-million-additional-respirators)
that allows 3M to continue exporting to developing countries, while also
providing the United States with 166 million masks over the next few
months.

Last month,
[Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_469)
and
[China](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-testkits/china-clamps-down-on-coronavirus-test-kit-exports-after-accuracy-questioned-idUKKBN21J51S)
introduced their own export restrictions on tests and protective
equipment.

Some private firms, however, are putting profit aside to help developing
countries with more fragile health systems.

A British testing manufacturer, Mologic, has received government funding
to develop a 10-minute home coronavirus test in partnership with Senegal
that, if approved, would cost less than $1 to produce. It would not be
reliant on labs, electricity or sourcing expensive supplies from global
manufacturers.

Mologic agreed to share its technology with Institut Pasteur de Dakar, a
flagship lab in Dakar, to help produce the kit “at cost.” While the goal
is to make it widely available, it is predominantly aimed at slowing the
spread of the virus in
Africa.

For poorer countries, the supply problem is bigger than just testing.

Zambia is at the very beginning of its epidemic curve with only [one
death](https://af.reuters.com/article/zambiaNews/idAFL8N2BQ3WC) so far,
but it is already struggling to source masks, as well as testing
materials like swabs and reagents, says Charles Holmes, a board member
of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia and the former
chief medical officer for the Obama administration’s President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR.

When Zambia tried to place an order for N95 masks, Dr. Holmes said, the
broker tried to sell them for “five to 10 times” more than the usual
cost, despite checks revealing the masks expired in 2016.

“It’s difficult for countries or governments having those conversations
with manufacturers, when much wealthier countries are having those same
conversations,” he said. “The private sector is likely to respond to the
highest bidder for many of these supplies, that’s just business.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said manufacturers have told Zambian officials that they cannot
guarantee a delivery date for supplies because “most of them are being
snapped up by the U.S. and Europe.”

While few would criticize governments for looking out for their own
people, health experts believe that it is in everyone’s interest to help
poorer countries get the supplies they need.

“An infection with a highly transportable respiratory virus anywhere in
the world puts all countries at risk,” Dr. Holmes said. “Wealthy nations
not only have an obligation to look out for countries that are going to
struggle, but they should also have some self interest in ensuring that
the pandemic is contained in developing countries.”
