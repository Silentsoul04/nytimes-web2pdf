\textbf{Isabel writes:} \emph{My partner is hesitant to buy new pants
because the style he prefers isn't made anymore. Lately his pants have
been falling apart. He keeps asking for or attempting repairs, but each
new tear is increasingly complex. Shouldn't he just get new pants?}

I sympathize. My wide waist, shortish legs and frankly majestically
muscled calves make finding well-fitting pants difficult. I, too, had a
favorite brand that was discontinued, and my pants hoard is closely
guarded. The good news is, for many of us, pants are pretty optional
right now. I don't know what's causing your husband to tear his pants
all the time (is he a Hulk?), but it's an excellent time to learn to
repair them properly on his own. When society returns (fingers crossed),
however, he needs to get out there and find a new style. We will all
need a fresh start and clean trousers in the new world.
