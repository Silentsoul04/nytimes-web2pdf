Much of the conversation surrounding black hair in recent years has been
about caring for and styling natural hair, and for good reason. As news
spread that relaxers may cause hormone disruptions and other health
issues, black women, in droves, began to cut off their relaxed hair and
wear their natural texture.

Yet many black women still do chemically straighten their hair. And
right now, they’re locked out of their main source of maintenance: the
salon.

As relaxed hair grows out, the new roots can create styling challenges,
like edges that won’t lie smooth. Then, over time, breakage can occur at
the fragile line between the old straight hair and the new textured
roots.

“The longer you wait to relax the new growth, the more you run the risk
of breakage,” said Ursula Stephen, a hairstylist who owns a salon in
Brooklyn. Combing and styling creates more friction in curly roots than
in straight ends. And the added tension can easily snap hair at the
demarcation line, in strands already weakened by chemical processing.

Decades ago, it was commonplace to relax one’s hair at home, but as

D.I.Y.-ing.

“At first, people were willing to wait this out,” said Jihan Thompson,
the chief executive of [Swivel Beauty](https://www.swivelbeauty.com/), a
booking app that vets salons that specialize in black and textured hair.
Now, as people realize they’ll be away from their stylists for the
foreseeable future, they’re looking for solutions.

Ms. Thompson hopes Swivel can help fill the hair-care gap with virtual
hairstyling consultations, in which stylists walk clients through
services like blowouts, protective styles and relaxer touch-ups.

“A lot of people are going to work virtually via video calls so they
don’t have to just pull their hair in a bun,” she said. “This is a way
stylists can continue to support them.”

Here, we explore some at-home options with three hair-care experts.

## Don’t Relax, but Do Moisturize

Instead of relaxing, you could just let your roots grow and treat them
with a lot of moisture, Ms. Stephen said. Moisture keeps the hair more
supple and helps prevent breakage. Deep condition more frequently. If
you were on a twice-a-month schedule, step it up to weekly.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Apply leave-in conditioner daily and focus on that line of
demarcation,” Ms. Stephen said. As you moisturize more, manipulate
your hair less.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

“The more combing you do, the more breakage you’ll have,” she said.
“This a good time to focus on caring for your hair and doing
protective styling.”

You can over-moisturize, she said, but it’s not a big deal. “The biggest
risk is it gets too soft, but all you have to do then is stop adding so
much moisture,” she said. “It’s reversible, but breakage isn’t.”

## Don’t Relax, but Do Use a Flat Iron

For medium to long hair, straightening your roots with a flat iron is a
good styling alternative to relaxing, said Tinika Sadiku of Hair by
Sadiku in Manhattan. Her advice: Work with small, thin sections of hair
and do so
slowly.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Tool kit: One-half-inch flat iron and heat protectant spray.

  - Blow-dry your hair.

  - Part your hair into four sections and start flat-ironing in one of
    the back sections. Pin away the other three so they’re out of the
    way.

  - Spray a heat protectant spray, like [Chi 44 Iron Guard Thermal
    Protection
    Spray](https://chi.com/chi-products/chi-haircare/chi-44-iron-guard-thermal-protecting-spray/),
    $8.

  - To really get access to the roots, you’ll need a “micro” flat iron.
    Ms Sadiku likes the[FHI Heat Platform Tourmaline Ceramic Pro Styler,
    $80.](https://www.amazon.com/FHI-Platform-Tourmaline-Ceramic-Professional/dp/B00BJF8BHE)

  - Begin flat-ironing at the nape of the neck, working your way toward
    the front of your head. Take a quarter-inch-wide section of hair,
    clamp the flat iron at the root, pause for a moment, then pull
    through to the ends in one motion. “The smaller the section, the
    more precise you’ll be, and the straighter your result,” Ms. Sadiku
    said.

## Relax Your Roots at Home

If you’ve watched your hairstylist touch up your roots for years, you
may have a false sense of confidence in your ability to mimic the
process at home. The most difficult aspect of relaxing your own hair is
not being able to see the back and crown, said Joie Wallace, a
hairstylist and colorist in Virginia.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When touching up your roots, it’s important to avoid putting relaxer on
hair that’s already straight. This is why people who do their own
relaxers often have breakage at the back and crown — they can’t see what
they’re doing. If you can, ask a helper to apply relaxer in those areas.
Or, set up your work station between two mirrors so you have more
visibility.

Hairstylists emphasize that you do not have to relax all of your roots.
For very short hair, a so-called edge-up relaxes just the back of the
hair, temples and sides. (Picture the hair that remains in male pattern
baldness.)

“I don’t think there’s a stylist alive who would say you should be
aiming to get your hair perfectly straight,” Ms. Sadiku said. “This is
about trying to feel a little more normal — not perfection.”

Opt for no-lye relaxer. It’s a gentler option that’s better for a
nonprofessional use. Ms. Wallace recommends the [Just for Me No-Lye

Relaxer
Kit,](https://www.amazon.com/conditioning-relaxer-childrens-regular-application/dp/B005IUGXY4)
$21.39. Follow the instructions that come with the kit. These tips will
help you optimize the process.

Here’s the most important rule: Coat only your new growth with relaxer.
Applying relaxer to already straightened hair will cause breakage.

Tool kit: No-lye relaxer kit, moisturizing conditioner, gloves, tail
comb, towel.

  - Apply the basing treatment (something like petroleum jelly that’s
    typically included in the kit) around your hairline and ears to
    protect your skin. And wrap your shoulders with a towel.

  - Part your hair into four sections. Slather conditioner, like [Shea
    Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Treatment
    Masque,](https://www.sheamoisture.com/jamaican-black-castor-oil-strengthen-and-restore-treatment-masque/764302215554.html)
    $13.99, on your straightened hair to create a barrier. Then clip
    away the sections you’re not working on.

  - Part two-inch wide sections of hair and apply the relaxer to the
    roots with the back of the comb. Work your way through each section
    using this technique.

  - Let it process for the proper amount of time according to your
    instructions (usually 10 minutes). It’s important to move quickly
    while applying relaxer so you don’t overprocess your hair.

  - Shampoo the relaxer out with the neutralizing shampoo included in
    your kit.
    
    Your stylist can whip the relaxer through all of your roots at once.
    But if that feels difficult for you, Ms. Stephens suggests going
    through the process — from application to shampoo — on just the
    front two sections of your hair, first. Relaxer should be applied
    only to dry hair, though. So make sure the back sections aren’t damp
    when you start the process over again there.
