# Cities Close Streets to Cars, Opening Space for Social Distancing

</div>

Boston, Minneapolis, Oakland and other cities have temporarily banned
through traffic on streets, giving pedestrians and cyclists extra elbow
room during the coronavirus pandemic.

With roads cleared of traffic because of the coronavirus pandemic, some
cities across the country have repurposed streets into car-free zones,
giving pedestrians and cyclists extra room to spread out and practice
[social
distancing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/bishop-gerald-glenn-coronavirus.html).

Cities including Boston,
[Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/news/2020/03/27/minneapolis-park-and-recreation-board-announces-lake-harriet-parkway-and-lake-nokomis-parkway-closures-to-help-trail-users-maintain-social-distancing/)
and Oakland, Calif., have closed streets to through motor traffic.
Others [are extending
sidewalks](https://twitter.com/BlineTransport/status/1248048199601999875)
to make more space for pedestrians looking to stay at least six feet
apart. And some municipalities are considering adopting similar
measures.

Samuel I. Schwartz, a consultant and former New York City traffic
commissioner known as Gridlock Sam for his traffic-curbing efforts,
supports the idea of car-free zones in the city.

“There is no more important resource in New York City and in all the
dense cities after people than space,” he said on Saturday. “And cities
are now dedicating 30 to 40 percent of their land areas to cars. This
could be a welcomed reclamation movement.”

Traffic at New York City’s busiest bridges and tunnels [has fallen
nearly 60
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-empty-streets.html).
The city recently experimented with a [short-lived pilot
program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-empty-streets.html)
that converted parts of four major thoroughfares to pedestrians for
social distancing. Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested that he [might
revisit](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/04/05/mayor-de-blasio-open-streets-are-not-a-priority-right-now/)
the program, which drew criticism from advocates of alternative
transportation for not going far enough.

In Oakland, some 74 miles of roadway, about 10 percent of the city’s
streets, will eventually be closed to through motor traffic as part of a
new program called [Oakland Slow
Streets](https://www.oaklandca.gov/projects/oakland-slow-streets) that
started on Saturday.

“This is an effort to give Oaklanders space to spread out to engage in
outdoor recreation in a socially distant manner,” Mayor Libby Schaaf
[announced](https://twitter.com/LibbySchaaf/status/1248793687774990336)
on Twitter on Friday.

The program began by closing four street segments to through traffic
(local traffic and emergency vehicles were still permitted).

“We want Oaklanders to have space and give our parks a break,” she
added, asking that residents wear a mask if they head outside.

An advocacy group for pedestrians and cyclists in Berkeley, Calif., has
also started a
[petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIXHpAjaZVu9hTSbRgx7z5YAtl3ZiNsJTw3WA3-awvywsd9w/viewform)
calling for a similar car-free program that would temporarily repurpose
the city’s bike boulevards.

On Saturday, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation & Recreation
[closed three segments of parkways in the greater Boston
area](https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-announces-additional-measures-to-reduce-crowding-at-state-parks)
to vehicles, leaving them open to pedestrians and cyclists only.

The department said that the measures, which are currently in place for
this weekend only, “will promote social distancing to aid in the
prevention of spreading Covid-19.” The department said it would evaluate
the effectiveness of the closures after the weekend.

In the Boston suburb of Brookline, the town’s Select Board and
Transportation Board last week
[approved](https://twitter.com/BlineTransport/status/1248048199601999875)
the extension of sidewalks along four major thoroughfares to enable
social distancing for cyclists, pedestrians, wheelchair users and
scooter riders. The modifications repurpose parking lanes, opening them
up for pedestrians by limiting motor traffic.

[Jonathan
Berk](https://medium.com/placemakers/our-cities-are-a-blank-canvas-what-do-we-want-to-paint-2170fa55e88f),
a proponent of [new
urbanism](http://www.newurbanism.org/newurbanism/principles.html),
applauded the efforts in Boston and beyond and said they allow residents
to see their cities in a new light.

“I’m hoping that as we continue over the next few weeks and months to
allocate more now-empty streets to people, it will show people the
benefits of a less auto-centric urban environment,” he said in an email.
“Showing urban residents what’s possible when you have this ‘blank
canvas’ of street space to utilize for walking, biking, running, playing
games with neighbors and just enjoying as a new, public neighborhood
open space.”
