# Examining Tara Reade’s Sexual Assault Allegation Against Joe Biden

</div>

Ms. Reade, a former Senate aide, has accused Mr. Biden of assaulting her
in 1993 and says she told others about it. A Biden spokeswoman said the
allegation is false, and former Senate office staff members do not
recall such an incident.

WASHINGTON — A former Senate aide who last year accused [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/politics/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview.html)
of inappropriate touching has made an allegation of sexual assault
against the former vice president, the Democratic Party’s presumptive
presidential nominee this fall.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The former aide, [Tara
Reade](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/us/politics/tara-reade-credentials.html),
who briefly worked as a staff assistant in [Mr.
Biden’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/technology/joe-biden-internet.html)
Senate office, told The New York Times that in 1993, Mr. Biden pinned
her to a wall in a Senate building, reached under her clothing and
penetrated her with his fingers. A friend said that Ms. Reade told her
the details of the allegation at the time. Another friend and a brother
of Ms. Reade’s said she told them over the years about a traumatic
sexual incident involving Mr. Biden.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Biden said the allegation was false. In
interviews, several people who worked in the Senate office with Ms.
Reade said they did not recall any talk of such an incident or similar
behavior by Mr. Biden toward her or any women. Two office interns who
worked directly with Ms. Reade said they were unaware of the allegation
or any treatment that troubled her.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last year, Ms. Reade and seven other women came forward to
[accuse](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/31/us/politics/joe-biden-flores.html)
Mr. Biden of [kissing, hugging or touching
them](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/02/us/politics/joe-biden-women-me-too.html)
in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. Ms. Reade told The Times then
that Mr. Biden had publicly stroked her neck, wrapped his fingers in her
hair and touched her in ways that made her uncomfortable.

Soon after Ms. Reade made the new allegation, in a [podcast
interview](https://soundcloud.com/katie-halper/joe-bidens-accuser-finally-tells-her-full-story)
released on March 25, The Times began reporting on her account and
seeking corroboration through interviews, documents and other sources.
The Times interviewed Ms. Reade on multiple days over hours, as well as
those she told about Mr. Biden’s behavior and other friends. The Times
has also interviewed lawyers who spoke to Ms. Reade about her
allegation; nearly two dozen people who worked with Mr. Biden during the
early 1990s, including many who worked with Ms. Reade; and the other
seven women who criticized Mr. Biden last year, to discuss their
experiences with him.

No other allegation about sexual assault surfaced in the course of
reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any
details of Ms. Reade’s allegation. The Times found no pattern of sexual
misconduct by Mr. Biden.

On Thursday, Ms. Reade filed a report with the Washington, D.C., police,
saying she was the victim of a sexual assault in 1993; the public
incident report, provided to The Times by Ms. Reade and the police, does
not mention Mr. Biden by name, but she said the complaint was about him.
Ms. Reade said she filed the report to give herself an additional degree
of safety from potential threats. [Filing a false police
report](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/5-117.05.html)may
be punishable by a fine and imprisonment.

Ms. Reade, who worked as a staff assistant helping manage the office
interns, said she also filed a complaint with the Senate in 1993 about
Mr. Biden; she said she did not have a copy of it, and such paperwork
has not been located. The Biden campaign said it did not have a
complaint. The Times reviewed an official copy of her employment history
from the Senate that she provided showing she was hired in December 1992
and paid by Mr. Biden’s office until August 1993.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The seven other women who had complained about Mr. Biden told the Times
this month that they did not have any new information about their
experiences to add, but several said they believed Ms. Reade’s account.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last year, Mr. Biden, 77, acknowledged the women’s complaints about his
conduct, saying his intentions were
[benign](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/26/us/politics/biden-the-view.html)
and promising to be “[more mindful and respectful of people’s personal
space](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/03/us/politics/joe-biden-women-video.html).”

In response to Ms. Reade’s allegation, Kate Bedingfield, a deputy Biden
campaign manager, said in a statement: “Vice President Biden has
dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around
violence against women. He authored and fought for the passage and
reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act. He firmly
believes that women have a right to be heard — and heard respectfully.
Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press.
What is clear about this claim: It is untrue. This absolutely did not
happen.”

Ms. Reade made her new allegation public as Mr. Biden was closing in on
the Democratic presidential nomination after winning a string of
primaries against his chief rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. Ms. Reade,
who describes herself as a “third-generation Democrat,” said she
originally favored Marianne Williamson and Senator Elizabeth Warren in
the race but voted for Mr. Sanders in the California primary last month.
She said her decision to come forward had nothing to do with politics or
helping Mr. Sanders, and said neither his campaign nor the Trump
campaign had encouraged her to make her allegation.

President Trump has been accused of
[sexual](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/17/us/former-apprentice-contestant-files-defamation-suit-against-trump.html)
[assault](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/24/us/politics/jean-carroll-trump.html)
and
[misconduct](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html)
by more than a dozen women, who have described a [pattern of
behavior](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/21/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html)
that went [far
beyond](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/30/nyregion/e-jean-carroll-trump-dna.html)
the accusations against Mr. Biden. The president [also directed illegal
payments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/07/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence.html),
including $130,000 to a pornographic film actress, [Stormy
Daniels](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/27/nyregion/stormy-daniels-trump-payment.html),
before the 2016 election to silence women about alleged affairs with Mr.
Trump, according to federal prosecutors.

Mr. Trump has even boasted about his mistreatment of women; in a 2005
recording, he described pushing himself on women and said he would
“[grab them by the
pussy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html),”
bragging that he could get away with “anything” because of his
celebrity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even so, Mr. Trump has at times [attacked
opponents](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/10/us/politics/bill-clinton-accusers.html)
over their treatment of women. The president has not mentioned Ms.
Reade’s allegation, which has circulated on social media and in
liberal and conservative news
outlets.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Reade, 56, told The Times that the assault happened in the spring of
1993. She said she had tracked down Mr. Biden to deliver an athletic bag
when he pushed her against a cold wall, started kissing her neck and
hair and propositioned her. He slid his hand up her cream-colored
blouse, she said, and used his knee to part her bare legs before
reaching under her skirt.

“It happened at once. He’s talking to me and his hands are everywhere
and everything is happening very quickly,” she recalled. “He was kissing
me and he said, very low, ‘Do you want to go somewhere else?’”

Ms. Reade said she pulled away and Mr. Biden stopped.

“He looked at me kind of almost puzzled or shocked,” she said. “He said,
‘Come on, man, I heard you liked me.’”

At the time, Ms. Reade said she worried whether she had done something
wrong to encourage his advances.

“He pointed his finger at me and he just goes: ‘You’re nothing to me.
Nothing,’” she said. “Then, he took my shoulders and said, ‘You’re OK,
you’re fine.’”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Biden walked down the hallway, Ms. Reade said, and she cleaned up in
a restroom, made her way home and, sobbing, called her mother, who
encouraged her to immediately file a police report.

Instead, Ms. Reade said, she complained to Marianne Baker, Mr. Biden’s
executive assistant, as well as to two top aides, Dennis Toner and Ted
Kaufman, about harassment by Mr. Biden — not mentioning the alleged
assault.

The staff declined to take action, Ms. Reade said, after which she filed
a written complaint with a Senate personnel office*.* She said office
staff took away most of her duties, including supervising the interns;
assigned her a windowless office; and made the work environment
uncomfortable for her.

She said Mr. Kaufman later told her she was not a good fit in the
office, giving her a month to look for a job. Ms. Reade never secured
another position in Washington.

In an interview, Mr. Kaufman, a longtime friend of Mr. Biden’s who was
his chief of staff at the time, said: “I did not know her. She did not
come to me. If she had, I would have remembered her.”

Mr. Toner, who worked for Mr. Biden for over three decades, said the
allegation was out of character for Mr. Biden. Other senators and office
staffs had reputations for harassing women at work and partying after
hours, according to those who worked in the office at the time. Mr.
Biden was known for racing to catch the train to get home to Wilmington,
Del., every night.

“It’s just so preposterous that Senator Biden would be faced with these
allegations,” said Mr. Toner, who was deputy chief of staff when Ms.
Reade worked in the office. “I don’t remember her. I don’t remember this
conversation. And I would remember this conversation.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Biden campaign issued a statement from Ms. Baker, Mr. Biden’s
executive assistant from 1982 to 2000.

“I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of
inappropriate conduct, period — not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone,”
she said. “I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade’s
accounting of events, which would have left a searing impression on me
as a woman professional, and as a manager.”

Melissa Lefko, a former staff assistant for Mr. Biden from 1992 to 1993,
said she did not remember Ms. Reade. But she recalled that Mr. Biden’s
office was a “very supportive environment for women” and said she had
never experienced any kind of harassment there.

“When you work on the Hill, everyone knows who the good guys are and who
the bad guys are, and Biden was a good guy,” she said.

Ms. Reade said that she could not remember the exact time, date or
location of the assault but that it occurred in a “semiprivate” place in
the Senate office complex.

A friend said that Ms. Reade told her about the alleged assault at the
time, in 1993. A second friend recalled Ms. Reade telling her in 2008
that Mr. Biden had touched her inappropriately and that she’d had a
traumatic experience while working in his office. Both friends agreed to
speak to The Times on the condition of anonymity to protect the privacy
of their families and their self-owned businesses.

Ms. Reade said she also told her brother, who has confirmed parts of her
account publicly but who did not speak to The Times, and her mother, who
has since died.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Differing recollections

At the time of the alleged assault, Ms. Reade said she was responsible
for coordinating the interns in the office. Two former interns who
worked with her said they never heard her describe any inappropriate
conduct by Mr. Biden or saw her directly interact with him in any
capacity but recalled that she abruptly stopped supervising them in
April, before the end of their internship. Others who worked in the
office at the time said they remembered Ms. Reade but not any
inappropriate behavior.

Friends and former co-workers describe Ms. Reade as friendly, caring,
compassionate and trustworthy, though perhaps a bit naïve. A single
mother, she changed her name for protection after leaving an abusive
marriage in the late 1990s and put herself through law school in
Seattle. After leaving Mr. Biden’s office, she eventually returned to
the West Coast, where she worked for a state senator; as an advocate for
domestic violence survivors, testifying as an expert witness in court;
and for animal rescue organizations.

During her time in Mr. Biden’s office, he was working to pass the
Violence Against Women Act, which Mr. Biden has described as his
[“proudest legislative
accomplishment.”](https://time.com/3319325/joe-biden-violence-against-women/)
In 2017, Ms. Reade retweeted praise for Mr. Biden and his work combating
sexual assault. In more recent months, her feed has featured support for
Mr. Sanders and criticism of Mr.
Biden.

Ms. Reade said she did not disclose the sexual assault allegation last
year when she spoke out because she was scared. After her initial
complaints were reported last year by [a local California
newspaper](https://www.theunion.com/news/nevada-county-woman-says-joe-biden-inappropriately-touched-her-while-working-in-his-u-s-senate-office/),
Ms. Reade said she faced a wave of criticism and death threats, as well
as accusations that she was a Russian agent because of Medium posts and
[tweets](https://twitter.com/ReadeAlexandra/status/1174846048788873216),
several of which are now deleted, she had written praising President
Vladimir Putin.

Ms. Reade said that she was not working for Russia and did not support
Mr. Putin, and that her comments were pulled out of context from a novel
she was writing at the time.

“It was trying to smear me and distract from what happened, but it won’t
change the facts of what happened in 1993,” she said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She called her praise for Mr. Putin “misguided.”

Ms. Reade tried to get legal and public relations support from the
[Time’s Up Legal Defense
Fund](https://nwlc.org/times-up-legal-defense-fund/), an
initiative<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>[established by

by [The
Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2020/03/24/joe-biden-metoo-times-up/).

As it has for thousands of people who have contacted the group, the
Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which does not represent clients, gave
her a list of lawyers with expertise in such cases. She said she
contacted every single one but none took her case. Two lawyers confirmed
speaking to Ms. Reade but declined to comment on the record about her or
the allegation.

SKDKnickerbocker, the political consulting firm where Mr. Biden’s chief
strategist, Anita Dunn, works as a managing director, has a contract
with the Time’s Up legal defense fund. Ms. Dunn has never worked with
the fund and her firm was not told of Ms. Reade’s request, according to
officials at the fund.

Ms. Reade also contacted at least one of the women who spoke out along
with her last year about Mr. Biden’s penchant for physical contact.

Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state assemblywoman who
[accused](https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/an-awkward-kiss-changed-how-i-saw-joe-biden.html)
Mr. Biden of making her uncomfortable by kissing and touching her during
a 2014 campaign event, exchanged a few emails last year with Ms. Reade
but said Ms. Reade did not share her full story.

“Biden is not just a hugger,” [Ms.
Flores](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/31/us/politics/lucy-flores-biden-accuser.html)said.
“Biden very clearly was invading women’s spaces without their consent in
a way that made them feel uncomfortable. Does he potentially have the
capacity to go beyond that? That’s the answer everyone is trying to get
at.”

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”
    
    Today: A former Senate aide to Joe Biden has accused him of
    assaulting her in 1993. My colleague Lisa Lerer examines the
    allegation.
    
    It’s Tuesday, April 14.
    
    Lisa, when did you begin reporting this story?

  - lisa lerer  
    So about a year ago, we were reporting on allegations from a number
    of women who came out and said that Joe Biden had touched them in
    ways that made them feel uncomfortable.

  - archived recording  
    Tonight, Joe Biden is facing troubling accusations. Nevada Democrat
    Lucy Flores claims the former vice president inappropriately touched
    and kissed her head before a rally in 2014.

lisa lerer

Maybe it was a squeeze on the shoulder, maybe he smelled their hair —

  - archived recording (lucy flores)  
    — out of nowhere, I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders,
    get up very close to me from behind, lean in, smell my hair and then
    plant a slow kiss on the top of my head.

lisa lerer

But this was all happening in public, at campaign rallies, at
fund-raisers.

  - archived recording 1  
    He put his hands around my head and pulled me in.

  - archived recording 2  
    Former congressional aide Amy Lappos told CBS News tonight that Joe
    Biden reached for her face and rubbed noses with her during a
    fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut in 2009.

lisa lerer

And we in the newsroom and in the media, we’re really grappling with how
to think and talk about this behavior. This wasn’t anything like what
had normally come up in a lot of these discussions around \#MeToo, like
Harvey Weinstein or any of that.

  - archived recording (lucy flores)  
    And for the record, I don’t believe that it was a bad intention. I’m
    not in any way suggesting that I felt sexually assaulted or sexually
    harassed. I felt invaded. I felt that there was a violation of my
    personal space. There was no —

lisa lerer

The women talking about these allegations weren’t quite sure what to
call it. Some of them said quite vehemently that they didn’t consider it
sexual harassment. But they wanted the former vice president to be aware
of his behavior and how it could make people feel. Others had a slightly
different perspective. They thought it was something closer to sexual
harassment. So this goes on for really a couple weeks. And in the end,
Biden — he doesn’t quite apologize.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Today, I want to talk about gestures of support and encouragement
    that I’ve made to women and some men, and it made them
    uncomfortable.

lisa lerer

But he comes out and he makes an online video where he says that he has
a very touchy feely kind of political style.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    In my career, I’ve always tried to make a human connection. That’s
    my responsibility, I think. I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men
    and women by the shoulders and say, you can do this.

lisa lerer

But he recognizes that times have changed, and perhaps he needs to
change with them and be more respectful of people’s space.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    You know, social norms have begun to change, they’ve shifted, and
    the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I
    get it. I get it. I hear what they’re saying. I understand it. And
    I’ll be much more mindful. That’s my responsibility. My
    responsibility. And I’ll meet it.

lisa lerer

And then, I met Tara Reade.

And she had called me with sort of similar kind of story. Joe Biden had
touched her, he’d put his hands in her hair, he touched her shoulders,
all in public, in ways that really made her feel uncomfortable. But her
story had a little bit of a different twist. So she, at the time, had
been working in his Senate office. And this was about — I think December
1992 to August 1993. She was a low-level staffer, a staff assistant. And
she said that the touching had gone beyond just hands in the hair and
squeezes of the shoulder. That there had been harassment.

michael barbaro

Hm.

lisa lerer

She says he had asked her to serve drinks at a cocktail party. He had
commented on her looks in the office, in front of other people. And that
she felt that he had cultivated a culture in his office that fostered
and permitted this kind of sexual harassment.

michael barbaro

And what did you do with Reade’s story, with that reporting?

lisa lerer

Well, I talked to her. I talked to her friend, who corroborated a lot of
what she was telling me. We did use her allegations to call a whole
bunch of people who had worked in Joe Biden’s office in the 1990s —
particularly the early 1990s, which was the period that Tara Reade was
working there — to see if they remembered any kind of harassment, what
the environment of the office was at the time. But we didn’t really come
up with anything all that surprising or explosive. Nobody really
confirmed her account at that time. So we actually didn’t end up
reporting them in the paper. We had already reported on a number of
allegations from these women who said that they were uncomfortable with
Joe Biden’s touching. And we just sort of moved on. And the political
world did too. Everyone moved on to the next battle. There was the
Mueller report to contend with, and then a really competitive primary,
presidential debates started. So this issue of the unwanted touching and
Tara’s story just never came back up.

michael barbaro

Mm hmm. And Lisa, do you think that has something to do with the fact
that Biden confronted this, talked about it and said he was learning
from it?

lisa lerer

Oh, for sure. But he was really forced into confronting it. I mean, this
was a period in March, in April, before Biden had formally announced his
presidential bid, where he was going through the process of reconciling
a lot of his record with the current mores of the Democratic Party. He
was dealing with his criminal justice record, he was dealing with his
positions on abortion and sort of moving to the left with the party. And
so I think that quasi-apology video was part of that process. You have a
Democratic Party that’s acutely aware of issues of racial and gender
bias, and Biden had to eventually reconcile those criticisms — whether
he felt they were fair or not — with where the party was. But
ultimately, he didn’t pay much of a price for it. He announced his
campaign a couple three or so weeks later. His opponents never made an
issue of this and everything sort of moved on.

michael barbaro

OK, so what happens next?

lisa lerer

Well, you have the primary race. So Biden, as we all know, nosedives.
Then he comes back up, he becomes the front-runner. And around that time
—

  - archived recording (katie halper)  
    Hello, and welcome to the Katie Halper Show.

lisa lerer

A woman goes on a podcast —

  - archived recording (katie halper)  
    Where would you like to start? Where does the story start for you?

  - archived recording (tara reade)  
    Well, the story starts when I went to work for Joe Biden.

lisa lerer

And levels a really serious, serious accusation against Joe Biden, which
is basically that he sexually assaulted her.

  - archived recording (tara reade)  
    And my body — I was shaking everywhere, because it was cold all of a
    sudden, and I was — I don’t know, I feel like I was shaking, just
    everywhere. And I was trying to grasp what had just happened, and
    what I should do.

lisa lerer

And that woman, who tells her story in great detail on this podcast, is
Tara Reade.

michael barbaro

So what are you thinking at this point? Because you had already talked
to this woman, and she had not mentioned this kind of accusation, right?

lisa lerer

Well, I must admit, I’m a little confused, because it didn’t come up at
all. And so the first thing I did was pull up my notes. And when I look
over my notes and I read the story she had told me a year ago, there’s
some holes in that story she told me. Things I remember thinking that
her reaction was maybe a bit extreme for what she said she was
experiencing in the office at the time. That maybe make a little more
sense if this other thing had in fact happened — this sexual assault. So
I wondered, first of all, had she been truthful the first time around?
Was she being truthful now? And also, whether I had asked the right
questions. Did I miss something because I hadn’t called back, because I
got caught up with the dynamics of this primary?

michael barbaro

So at this point — after Tara Reade has gone on this podcast, she has
made this claim, and you’re trying to figure out why she didn’t first
tell you that same information — how are you now approaching this story,
journalistically?

lisa lerer

So I think we all quickly agreed that it wasn’t a question of whether we
would approach the story, but how. This was a woman who was making very
serious allegations of sexual assault with her name attached, publicly,
against the man who is more than likely to become the Democratic nominee
for president. So we had to grapple with these claims. The question was,
how? And I think the natural thing to do — really, the human thing to do
— is to go into a story like this and say, do you believe or not believe
the person who’s making the accusation? But that’s not the journalistic
thing to do. We’re not judges, we’re not the jury, we’re not the police
department. I was really focused on what we could show to be true and
what we could show to not be true. What we had corroboration on, and
what we didn’t have corroboration on. And what kind of facts we could
give voters and the American public about this whole incident, that’s
already out in the world and being passed around quite actively on
social media. People knew about it.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

But they didn’t know the details, and they didn’t really know what was
true or not.

michael barbaro

And so where do you begin as you’re trying to figure this all out?

lisa lerer

Well, so the main thing I needed to do was get Tara Reade back on the
phone. So that’s where I began.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

So Lisa, tell me about this, I guess, second round of communications
that you have with Tara Reade, after she claims that Joe Biden has
assaulted her.

lisa lerer

So I call her, and we start talking every day. And the obvious first
question I ask her is why she didn’t tell me about these allegations
when we talked a year ago. And she tells me that even though they
weren’t published in The New York Times, they were published in a
local paper. And the feedback she got from that being out there, the
kind of death threats and harassment online, made her reluctant to tell
the rest of her story. So we talk through all that, and then eventually,
I say to her that I need her to tell me the story that she told on that
podcast in a way that we can use on the record. And I start recording
her.

  - interposing voices  
    Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, I hear you. Yep, I got you.

michael barbaro

And what does she say?

  - lisa lerer  
    So where do you want to start?

  - tara reade  
    OK. So let’s start with the assault.

lisa lerer

So the story that I’m about to tell you is all according to Tara Reade.
So it’s 1993, in the spring some time, and she’s working as a staff
assistant in Joe Biden’s Senate office. And one day, she’s at work, and
her supervisor comes up to her and has this athletic bag — this gym bag
— and asks her if she would find the senator and bring him his gym
bag.

  - tara reade  
    She just said, take him his gym bag, hurry\! And she was like, he’ll
    meet you, he’s down towards the Capitol.

lisa lerer

So she heads down and finds him somewhere in the Capitol complex of
offices.

  - tara reade  
    And I ran into him, like I saw him, and I — he acknowledged me, he
    was talking to someone, they walked away. And then he said, come
    here, Tara. And then he smiled at me, greeted me.

lisa lerer

And she says, hello, Senator.

  - tara reade  
    I called him “Senator.” I didn’t call him “Joe.” And I handed him
    the bag with my right hand, I remember that.

lisa lerer

And the next thing she remembers, he’s pinned her up against a wall,
which she remembers as being very, very cold. And he’s kissing her.

  - tara reade  
    It happened at once, and that’s what’s so hard about telling this
    story. Like he’s talking to me, and his hands are everywhere, and
    everything’s happening at once very quickly. This happened, like, in
    under two minutes.

lisa lerer

And according to Tara, he reaches his hand under her shirt — she
remembers she was wearing a cream-colored blouse — grabs her left
breast.

  - tara reade  
    He used his knee to part my knees, because my legs went together.
    And he went kind of down my skirt, and then as he’s parting my legs
    with his knee, he like went up, and then just went under. And then,
    of course, yeah, he was able to do what he did, which was he took —
    it felt like one or two fingers, and inserted them in my vagina.

lisa lerer

And at that point, he’s kissing her and he says to her, she says, do you
want to go somewhere else? And he tried — she said — to kiss her on the
mouth, but she moves her head.

  - tara reade  
    And then he pulled back, because I wasn’t responding to him, I
    wasn’t kissing him back. I completely froze up, and he had kind of
    lifted me up, so I was like up on my tippy toes almost. And then he
    looked back and he looked at me —

lisa lerer

And he looks at her, and he says, according to her —

  - tara reade  
    Come on, man. I heard you liked me. Then he smiled, but then when I
    looked at his eyes, he was angry. Like there —

lisa lerer

And she said she remembers standing there, just kind of frozen, and she
felt almost a little bad, like she had put him in a bad position. And
she was wondering what she did to make him think that she would be
interested in this. And according to Tara, he looked her and he said —

  - tara reade  
    He pointed his finger at me and he just goes, you’re — you’re
    nothing to me. And then he looked at me, and he goes, nothing.

lisa lerer

You’re nothing to me. Nothing. And she thinks she must have looked a
certain way or had a certain expression in her eye, because then he kind
of took her by the shoulders and patted her shoulders, and said, you’re
OK, you’re fine. And he kind of almost set her down, she said, and then
he walked off and walked down the hall.

  - tara reade  
    I know I went to the restroom, I know I did, to clean up. But I
    don’t remember which restroom I went to in the Russell Building or
    there — I don’t know. But I know I did. But my vivid memory next is
    sitting — I was trying to pull myself together in the back stairs at
    the Russell Building with those big windows. I remember just sitting
    on the stairs, and nobody was there. And just like my whole body was
    literally — I couldn’t control my shaking. I remember just being so
    cold. So cold.

lisa lerer

And then she headed home. She doesn’t remember how she got there. She
doesn’t remember whether she went back into the office and got her bag
or talked to anybody. But she made it home to her apartment.

  - tara reade  
    The next thing I remember is being on the phone with my mom and
    crying and then arguing with her.

lisa lerer

And her mother tells her in fairly firm language that she needs to
immediately file a police report.

  - tara reade  
    You know, she even swore at me. She was not being gentle and
    supportive, and I understand, because she wanted me to have
    evidence. And now I understand what she was trying to do, and I
    didn’t then.

lisa lerer

But Tara doesn’t do that.

michael barbaro

And does she say why she did not go to the police?

lisa lerer

Well, what she says is that she basically just wanted the whole thing to
go away, is what she told me. That after it happened, she took a shower.
She says she threw out all her clothes that she was wearing at the time.

  - tara reade  
    I threw everything out. Even the shoes. Everything. Like, I just —
    that’s how I felt about it.

  - lisa lerer  
    Really? What kind of —

lisa lerer

She tells me that she called in sick to work, that she was sobbing
uncontrollably.

  - tara reade  
    It’s like I just didn’t want it to have happened. It just didn’t
    happen.

michael barbaro

And what does she say happens in the days and maybe even weeks after
this alleged incident?

lisa lerer

So she tells me eventually she does go back to work. And when she does,
she says that she tells her immediate supervisor, who’s Biden’s personal
secretary, as well as two top staffers in the office — the deputy chief
of staff and the chief of staff — that she feels uncomfortable around
Joe Biden. She never mentions the alleged assault, but she talks more
about feeling uncomfortable with him touching her shoulders or tangling
his hands in her hair. And in her telling, the staff don’t really do
anything about that. In fact, she feels that they kind of penalize her
for bringing that forward. She says they strip her of one of her duties,
which is supervising the interns. She says they put her in a windowless
office, far from the rest of the staff. So at some point, she says that
she goes to a Senate personnel office and files a formal complaint.

michael barbaro

And what does she say was in this complaint?

lisa lerer

She said that complaint really detailed the harassment and what she saw
as retaliation in the office. But she believes that that forum
eventually was returned to Biden’s office, which would have been a
flouting of what the official protocol was at that time. And once that
complaint was returned to Biden’s office, she says, she was given a
month to find a new job, and basically eased out of her position. And so
she started looking for another position on Capitol Hill, she says, and
never ended up getting hired or finding anything.

michael barbaro

So Lisa, once Tara Reade has given you this account of an alleged
attack, what do you do next?

lisa lerer

So at this point, she’s told me a lot of information. And some really
detailed information too. So I start thinking about what can be
corroborated, what we can show to be true and what we can show to be not
true. And one thing that Tara mentions to me is that at the time, she
had called a friend and told her the whole story. So I tracked down the
friend.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

And in large part, she corroborates the story that Tara had told me.
Tara tells me she also told her mother. Her mother is deceased, so she
can’t be called. And she told a version of her story to her brother,
though not all the details. So I start trying to track down her brother.
And she tells me she told a friend in 2008, after Joe Biden had been
picked as Barack Obama’s vice president. She had told a version of this
story to that friend, without all the details, but that something had
happened to her. So I tracked down that friend, and she confirms that
account and some of the things that Tara tells me.

michael barbaro

Where does that leave you?

lisa lerer

So it leaves us with something, but certainly not enough to corroborate
this entire story. We really only have the one friend with the full
story, and everyone else is just giving us bits and pieces. So that’s
not the kind of full corroboration that you’re looking for as a
journalist, when you’re trying to confirm really serious allegations and
also really politically explosive allegations. But at this point, it’s
time to turn to the Biden side of things. So along with my colleague
Sydney Ember, we start looking at who we can talk to. And we start by
calling the three top staffers in the office at the time that Tara had
mentioned she had spoken with, and she had raised those complaints of
harassment to. All three of them say that a woman named Tara Reade never
approached them with these kind of allegations, and two of them said
they didn’t remember her at all even working in the office.

michael barbaro

So just to be clear, the three people that Tara Reade said she went to
and told of Biden’s behavior that made her uncomfortable, pretty senior
people in his office, they say they have no recollection of that ever
happening?

lisa lerer

Exactly. They have no recollection. And a lot of the former staffers are
mystified by her account too. They don’t remember anything like this, or
even the hint of anything like this. So they — when Sydney and I call
them, they’re trying to reconcile themselves her story with what they
remember from working in that office. A lot of them didn’t want to talk
on the record. One who did said that at the time, you knew who the good
guys and bad guys were on the Senate. The places where — offices where
women would and would not want to work, and she described Biden as one
of the good guys.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

So after that, we reached out to another group of people, which is the
interns. And that’s because Tara had told me that she supervised the
interns, and that she shared an office with these interns. So I reached
two of them, and they both tell me that they’d never heard of anything,
never saw anything like the kind of harassment and assault Tara had been
alleging. But that they did remember midway through their internship,
sometime in April, she had been suddenly removed as their boss. And they
never knew why, and they never saw her again. So amid all this
confusion, I remember that there’s one thing that really could cut
through all this and clarify exactly what did or did not happen.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

And that’s this complaint that Tara had told me she filed in 1993 with
the Senate office —

michael barbaro

Right.

lisa lerer

— and that someone had written down. So we start trying to track down
that complaint. And we call the Federal Office of Personnel Management,
and they tell us to file a Freedom of Information request, which would
take months, if not years. And anyhow, we don’t really know exactly what
we’re asking for, because she doesn’t remember the name of the office
where she filed this complaint.

michael barbaro

Right.

lisa lerer

We call over to the Senate and we’re able to get some employment
records, but not this complaint. So we basically look for this document
and come up empty. It’s unfindable in the end.

michael barbaro

What about other aspects of Reade’s life that might feel relevant? I
mean, possible political affiliations or motivations. How do you begin
to think and report on those?

Well, so one thing that we want to be really sure of is that she is who
she says she is. And that this isn’t someone in the midst of a heated
presidential campaign — that’s only, of course, going to get more heated
by all expectations — that is trying to push an agenda, or possibly pull
a fast one on the media to try to get claims that are untrue out there
in the public. So I really talked to her a lot about her political
affiliation. She describes herself as a third-generation Democrat, but
walks me through the fact that she liked Marianne Williamson. She really
liked Elizabeth Warren. and when California voted in the primary over
Super Tuesday, she backed Bernie Sanders. But she insists that her
motivation for this is not political, even though I had watched as
supporters of Sanders and supporters of President Trump, really, are the
ones pushing this allegation out there on social media, and really
keeping the drumbeat up for people to investigate it. So that’s one
concern. And there is this other unusual detail.

michael barbaro

Which is what?

lisa lerer

Well, she had written a fair amount in Medium posts and on Twitter about
her support for Russia and her respect for Vladimir Putin. And so we
read through all those Medium posts. Some of them had been pulled down
off the internet, but we found them. We looked through those old Twitter
posts, and we really tried to investigate whether there could be some
kind of nefarious agenda there. And she says that she was misguided.
Tara Reade says that she had been working on a novel — she’s not anymore
— about Russia, and this was all part of her research. And she says that
she doesn’t have any respect for Vladimir Putin now, has never been to
Russia. So we decide that that’s not so disqualifying that it prevents
us from putting a version of her story in the paper.

michael barbaro

So how are you thinking about everything that you have reported at this
point? And I assume, in consultation with your editors, how are you
planning to proceed?

lisa lerer

Well, one thing we know is that we can’t corroborate her story beyond
the two friends and her brother.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

We know we can’t find any documents, and we know that everyone who
worked for Joe Biden is denying that anything like this ever happened,
or could have happened.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

lisa lerer

And we also know one other thing. And this is really important. As far
as we’ve learned in our reporting, there is no pattern of this kind of
behavior from Joe Biden. What we had seen a year ago was a very
different thing. It was touching in public, rubbing of shoulders, or
maybe touching of hair that made some women feel uncomfortable. This is
an allegation of a sexual assault. Those things are not at all similar.
And in fact, what Tara Reade is alleging is a fairly singular act, as
far as we know. But the Democratic Party, they’ve really set a very high
standard for taking these cases seriously, for taking allegations of
sexual abuse seriously. Even Joe Biden has taken a strong position on
this, and it’s worth remembering the Kavanaugh hearings. And one thing
that Joe Biden said when that was all going on was this, he said: “For a
woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you’ve
got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what
she’s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether
or not it’s been made worse or better over time. But nobody fails to
understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron.

michael barbaro

So it’s Biden himself saying, essentially, believe women.

lisa lerer

That’s exactly right. Biden essentially saying, believe women. And I
think that explains part of the approach to these allegations that
you’ve seen from his campaign. Joe Biden himself has not spoken about
them at all, and I don’t think he’s been asked directly, although I
suppose that could come. But his campaign has been very careful in all
their public statements to say that they believe women, that they think
coming out like this is a credible thing to do. But in this case, they
say the allegations are false. But they’re really walking a tightrope
when they talk about this politically, with many in the base of the
Democratic Party.

michael barbaro

Well, help me understand that. I mean, with all that history in mind
that you just described, of the Democratic Party setting such a high
standard for itself — and Biden himself, the presumptive Democratic
nominee, saying, believe women — how is the Democratic establishment,
how is the Democratic Party responding to what Tara Reade has alleged
happened to her?

lisa lerer

They’re not responding. Nobody in the Democratic establishment, elected
officials, party leaders, has discussed this at all.

michael barbaro

Why do you think that is? I mean, is that a function of the conflicting
information here? Is that party loyalty to the de facto nominee? Is that
about the fact that there is just one of these accusations, not a
pattern, as you just said? How do you explain that?

lisa lerer

Well, honestly, I think it’s some of all of that. When I talk to people
who are close to Joe Biden, and I’ve now talked to quite a lot of them,
they say that this is something that’s just so completely out of
character for him. They describe a man who’s fiercely devoted to his
wife and his kids. That he would spend a lot of time focusing on when he
could get the quickest train, the soonest train, home to Delaware so he
could see them. And they just cannot reconcile these allegations that
are out with the guy that they have known for all these decades. So they
say they can’t believe it’s true. But when you look at the political
calendar, we’re in the spring of an election year, Joe Biden is going to
be the Democratic nominee. So you have to figure that many, many
Democrats also just don’t want this to be true.

Lisa, thank you very much.

lisa lerer

Thanks for having me.

  - archived recording (bernie sanders)  
    So today, I am asking all Americans — I’m asking every Democrat, I’m
    asking every independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans to come
    together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I
    endorse.

michael barbaro

On Monday, Joe Biden was endorsed by his former rival, Senator Bernie
Sanders.

  - archived recording (joe biden)  
    Well, Bernie I want to thank you for that. It’s a big deal. I think
    that your endorsement means a great deal. It means a great deal to
    me.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (emmanuel macron)  
    \[SPEAKING FRENCH\]

michael barbaro

On Monday, France said it would extend a nationwide lockdown until the
middle of May. Britain was expected to extend its lockdown. And Russia’s
president offered his darkest assessment yet of the virus’s impact
there.

  - archived recording (vladimir putin)  
    \[SPEAKING RUSSIAN\]

michael barbaro

During a meeting with his advisors, Vladimir Putin said, quote, “We see
the situation changing daily. And unfortunately, not for the better.”

  - archived recording (andrew cuomo)  
    Thank you very much. Good afternoon to everyone. Let me welcome my
    fellow governors, who are on the telephone, who you’ll hear from in
    a moment.

michael barbaro

In the U.S., two groups of governors — one on the east coast, the other
on the west coast — said they would decide regionally when and how to
reopen their state’s economies, and emphasized that they would not do so
until experts and data showed that it would be safe.

  - archived recording (andrew cuomo)  
    Again, we anticipate different facts, different circumstances for
    different states, different parts of states. But let’s be smart and
    let’s be cooperative. And let’s learn from one another.

michael barbaro

During a conference call, the governors, including Tom Wolfe of
Pennsylvania, said that it was their role, not the federal government’s,
to make that decision.

  - archived recording (tom wolfe)  
    Well, seeing as how had the responsibility for closing the state
    down, I think we probably have the primary responsibility for
    opening it up.

michael barbaro

A few hours later, President Trump was asked about the governor’s
announcement.

  - archived recording  
    Just to clarify your understanding of your authority, vis-à-vis
    governors, if a governor issued a stay at home —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    You say my authority. The president’s authority. Not mine, because
    it’s not me. This is — when somebody is the president of the United
    States, the authority is total. And that’s the way it’s got to be.

michael barbaro

The president insisted that the decision was his.

  - archived recording  
    Your authority’s total?

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    It’s total. It’s total. And the governors know that.

  - archived recording  
    So if a —

  - archived recording (donald trump)  
    The governors know that. You know, you have a couple of bands of —
    excuse me. Excuse me.
