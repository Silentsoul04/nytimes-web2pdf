``Something that's comforting and familiar is good, especially in a time
like this,'' says Shannon Mustipher, a former bartender and the author
of ``Tiki: Modern Tropical Cocktails.'' As the pandemic keeps people
inside --- and makes bars and restaurants a far-off dream --- we're all
looking for distraction and comfort: television bingeing, Instagram
scrolling, drinking. If you're a wine or beer drinker, stick to your
regular. For those more adept at mixology, try taking one of your
favorites and lightening up the pour: Make it with half the alcohol, or
dilute it with sparkling water. Still, pay attention to how much you're
taking in, to avoid overdoing it. ``If it's on the lighter side, you can
have a few and not get too tanked, which is good,'' Mustipher says ---
especially in a time like this.

A devotee of rum drinks, Mustipher has been making a lighter version of
one of her go-to cocktails, what she calls the Ti' Fizz. Ti' Punch ---
``basically a glass of booze with sugar in it,'' she says --- is the
national drink of Martinique, a favorite vacation spot of Mustipher's.
It is intended to be adjusted to your personal taste, hence the local
saying: ``\emph{Chacun prepare sa propre mort},'' or ``each prepares his
own death.'' To make her regular punch, Mustipher combines two ounces of
rhum agricole blanc and lime juice (any citrus juice will do if you're
out of limes) in a rocks glass, then adds an oversize ice cube and soda
water. Turn the preparation into a project. Mustipher has used overripe
fruit to make syrups for drinks.

Self-isolation is also a good time to start an ``infinity bottle,'' in
which you combine various leftover whiskeys that might be taking up
space in your bar into a single mixture, adjusted according to your
stock and your preferences --- smoky, spicy, briny, honeyed. ``You could
spend a couple of hours tasting through your stuff and figuring out what
you like,'' Mustipher says. It will age, too. ``Monitor over a few
weeks, and have fun with it that way.'' And when you restock, try to
shop locally, whether from privately owned liquor stores or restaurants
and bars looking to unload their spirits --- that way, you might be able
to help the community's economy as well as your next old-fashioned.
