MIAMI — The soundless video shows a man wearing a protective mask
picking up bags and boxes outside a white van when a Miami police
officer pulls up.

The officer steps out of his squad car. Words are exchanged. Then the
officer handcuffs and detains the man, Dr. Armen Henderson, who was
recently featured in a [Miami Herald
article](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241554991.html)
about volunteers who provide free coronavirus testing for homeless
people in downtown Miami.

Dr. Henderson was eventually removed from the handcuffs after his wife,
Leyla Hussein, emerged from the couple’s home and showed identification
to the officer.

Dr. Henderson was not arrested, but after video of the encounter was
shared widely online, Chief Jorge Colina of the Miami Police Department
ordered an internal investigation into the matter.

The encounter, in the western Miami neighborhood of Flagami on Friday,
comes amid reports of racial profiling during the coronavirus pandemic.
The virus is disproportionately infecting and killing African-Americans,
some of whom worry that following the recommendation by the Centers for
Disease Control and Protection to cover their faces in public [could
expose them to harassment from the
police](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-masks-racism-african-americans.html).

According to Chief Colina, the city had been receiving “a litany of
complaints pertaining to illegal dumping” of trash on the streets from
residents in Flagami, a boot-shaped neighborhood by the Miami
International Airport.

“There is a cargo van that is parked in front of that home where there
appears to be trash that is being offloaded,” the chief said of the home
security video that shows Dr. Henderson’s encounter with the officer.
“That is the genesis of the stop. Now, what happens after that, what’s
being discussed, the actions taken, etc., all that needs to be
investigated, and it will be investigated.”

Chief Colina did not release the name of the officer, who is a sergeant.

Orlando Rodriguez, a public information officer at the Police
Department, declined to release any further details on Tuesday, citing a
continuing internal affairs investigation.

Dr. Henderson, 34, practices internal medicine in the [University of
Miami Health
System](https://doctors.umiamihealth.org/provider/Armen+Henderson/525783).

Dr. Henderson said in an interview that he was loading his van with
tents to take to homeless people in downtown Miami around 11:30 a.m. on
Friday when the officer approached him.

“He asked me if I lived there and if I was littering,” Dr. Henderson
recalled on Tuesday.

“And I said, ‘No, this is where the city picks up our bulky trash every
week,’ and then I just left it at that,” Dr. Henderson said. He thought
the conversation was over and turned around.

He said the officer asked him for identification, which the doctor said
he did not have on him at the time and would have to retrieve.

Dr. Henderson turned around to resume his cleanup, he said, and the
officer handcuffed him.

“I did not know I was under arrest,” he said.

Dr. Henderson recalled feeling “kind of angry” in the moment. “We see
how these things kind of escalate, and all those things are going
through my head,” he said. “He was yelling and, to me, it wasn’t worth
it.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

He called for his wife, who was inside the house with their 5-year-old
daughter and 11-month-old son.

After his wife presented identification, Dr. Henderson said, the officer
released him.

Dr. Henderson said he was concerned that the officer approached him
without wearing a protective mask.

“He was up in my face without a mask on,” said Dr. Henderson, who added
that he could feel the officer’s spit on his face.

The officer did not apologize before leaving, according to Dr.
Henderson, who said he filed a complaint with the department’s Civilian
Investigative Panel the next day. He said he had not heard from the
department.

He said he wanted people to know “that it was wrong, that it was racial
profiling, that the police are still acting like it’s business as usual
even though it’s a pandemic.”

Florida has confirmed [more than 21,000 coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/florida-coronavirus-cases.html)
and nearly 500 deaths as the virus continues to spread in the state.
South Florida, which includes Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach
Counties, has had the most cases in the state. Miami-Dade County alone
has had more than 7,400 cases.

Last month, Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami disclosed that he had tested
positive for the coronavirus, making him one of the first elected
officials in the United States to [announce that he had contracted the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-miami-francis-suarez.html).
After two weeks of quarantine, he has since tested negative.
