# Trump’s Claim of Total Authority in Crisis Is Rejected Across Ideological Lines

Trading barbs with governors about their powers over when to ease

WASHINGTON — President Trump’s claim that he wielded “total” authority
in the pandemic crisis prompted rebellion not just from governors. Legal
scholars across the ideological spectrum on Tuesday rejected his
declaration that ultimately he, not state leaders, will decide when to
risk lifting social distancing limits in order to reopen businesses.

“When somebody’s the president of the United States, the authority is
total,” Mr. Trump asserted at [a raucous press
briefing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-governors.html)
on Monday evening. “And that’s the way it’s got to be.”

But neither the Constitution nor any federal law bestows that power upon
Mr. Trump, a range of legal scholars and government officials said.

“We don’t have a king in this country,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York
said on Tuesday, adding, “There are laws and facts — even in this wild
political environment.” He rebutted Mr. Trump’s claim by citing a line
from [Alexander
Hamilton](https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/speech-on-the-compromises-of-the-constitution/),
observing that presidential encroachment on powers that the Constitution
reserved to the states would be “repugnant to every rule of political
calculation.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cuomo is a Democrat, but even some of the most outspoken Republican
supporters of a generally sweeping vision of presidential power agreed
that Mr. Trump’s claim was empty.

[John
Yoo](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/04/no-trump-cant-force-states-to-reopen/),
a University of California, Berkeley, law professor known for writing
much-disputed Justice Department memos after the Sept. 11 attacks
claiming that President George W. Bush, as commander in chief, had the
power to override legal limits on torture and surveillance for the war
against Al Qaeda, said Mr. Trump could not force states to reopen.

“Only the states can impose quarantines, close institutions and
businesses, and limit intrastate travel,” Mr. Yoo wrote in [The National
Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/04/no-trump-cant-force-states-to-reopen/).
“Democratic governors Gavin Newsom in California, Andrew Cuomo in New
York, and J.B. Pritzker Illinois imposed their states’ lockdowns, and
only they will decide when the draconian policies will end.”

Vice President Mike Pence — who [styled himself as a strong proponent of
states’
rights](https://robbishop.house.gov/media/press-releases/house-members-take-cause-liberty)
when Barack Obama was president — was a lonely voice backing Mr. Trump.
“In the long history of this country,” he said on Monday, “the
authority of the president of the United States during national
emergencies is unquestionably plenary.”

The Constitution bestows specific powers on the federal government while
reserving the rest to sovereign state governments. None of the
enumerated powers given to the federal government directly address
control over public health measures, although the Constitution does let
Congress regulate interstate commerce.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Both a pandemic and social distancing measures that require the closure
of businesses, to be sure, affect interstate commerce. But even if the
federal government in theory could have more power in this area, it
would take an act of Congress to bestow it on the
presidency.

Lawmakers have created some executive powers relevant to the crisis —
including enabling an administration to take steps to keep illness from
spreading across state lines and to mobilize industry to ramp up
production of needed goods in a public health crisis. But they have
passed no statute purporting to give the presidency pre-eminence over
governors on rescinding public health limits inside states.

Similarly, while Mr. Trump [declared a national
emergency](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/politics/coronavirus-national-emergency.html)
over the pandemic, that did not mean he was tapping into some reservoir
of limitless constitutional power. Rather, he was activating specific
statutes that Congress has enacted creating particular standby powers,
none of which include letting a president overturn state-imposed public
health safety measures.

In [a 1952 case](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/579/)
involving President Harry S. Truman’s seizure of steel mills to avert a
strike during the Korean War, the Supreme Court rejected his effort to
invoke purported “inherent” constitutional power to resolve the crisis
using different tools than Congress had provided.

And even if Congress were to now enact a law giving Mr. Trump that power
— which is unlikely, with the House in the hands of Democrats — there
would still be legal obstacles. The Supreme Court over the last
generation has pushed back when Congress has enacted laws that the court
sees as federal commandeering of states’ authority.

“The federal government may neither issue directives requiring the
states to address particular problems, nor command the states’ officers,
or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a
federal regulatory program,” Justice Antonin Scalia wrote [in a 1997
Supreme Court ruling](https://casetext.com/case/printz-v-us).

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to seek a face-saving way out, saying he
was “authorizing” governors to decide for themselves when to reopen
their states. He offered no explanation for the implication that his
permission was necessary before they could lift their own orders.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For Mr. Trump, the legal emptiness of his assertion fits with a larger
pattern in his handling of the pandemic and more. Where President
Theodore Roosevelt liked to invoke an African proverb to describe his
approach to wielding executive power — “speak softly and carry a big
stick” — Mr. Trump sometimes talks as if he has a big stick but with
little to back it up.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Despite his “extreme, proud rhetoric about how he can do whatever he
wants,” said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and senior Justice
Department official in the George W. Bush administration, the story of
the Trump presidency has been, with few exceptions, “talking a big game,
but not in fact exercising executive power successfully.”

Mr. Trump has made greater use of a softer power of the presidency:
using his pre-eminent position and the attention he commands for public
persuasion, which Roosevelt called the bully pulpit. But Mr. Trump used
it at first to play down the crisis, rather than issuing a call to
action to galvanize the country to more swiftly take steps [like ramping
up testing
capacity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html)
and consider imposing social distancing measures.

Some legal experts theorized that Mr. Trump could try to use the federal
government’s control over disaster relief funds and equipment to punish
states whose governors reject a hypothetical future White House
declaration that it is time to open up.

He could, for example, try to allocate more equipment to states whose
governors acquiesce to his desires, which would inevitably lead to
litigation. Even so, as Mr. Yoo wrote, such punitive measures are
politically unlikely to move Democratic governors in hard-hit areas to
reopen their economies before public health experts say it is safe.

Mr. Trump demurred when pressed to say who told him he wielded “total”
authority, and his administration has put forward no legal theory.

Some White House officials expressed uncertainty about what the
president was relying on. But others pointed to Article II of the
Constitution, which creates the presidency and which Mr. Trump has often
invoked, and several statutes creating certain public health powers.
None of those statutes they cited say a president has total authority to
force governors to lift pandemic restrictions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Indeed, numerous legal scholars rejected Mr. Trump’s claim as baseless,
including Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor
[who testified in the president’s favor during the impeachment
inquiry](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html?searchResultPosition=2).

“The Constitution was written precisely the deny that particular claim,”
[Mr. Turley wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/JonathanTurley/status/1249837933038837760).

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people

      - Employers have to provide [a safe

Complicating the task of parsing the president’s intentions, he often
appears to float striking and self-aggrandizing ideas off the cuff,
causing consternation before he drops them.

On March 28, for example, he abruptly suggested that he might impose a
federal quarantine on the New York City area before reversing course
hours later.

It was never clear what he was talking about. While Congress has
[granted the federal government some
power](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/264) to take steps to
prevent the transmission of illness into the country or between states,
the virus was already everywhere by then, so sealing state borders would
not have kept it contained. And a quarantine that would confine large
populations to their homes within a state is widely understood to be a
state-level decision.

Yet despite punctuating his performance with claims of his own might,
Mr. Trump has repeatedly made less-than-aggressive use of undisputed
authorities at his disposal to combat the pandemic.

For example, he has repeatedly boasted about shutting down travel from
China in February, using the power that Congress granted to the
presidency to control the international border in a public health
emergency.

But despite Mr. Trump’s claims that he was the first to take that
action, 38 other countries [had already put in place such a travel
ban](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/07/trumps-claim-that-he-imposed-first-china-ban/).
And the American version was [limited and
porous](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html).

And as it became clear in March that hospitals were hindered by
shortages of masks and other equipment, Mr. Trump [resisted growing
calls](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-supplies.html)
to make use of another power Congress gave the presidency for use in a
national emergency: to coerce factory owners to change what they are
manufacturing under the Defense Production Act.

In late March, Mr. Trump finally declared that he was invoking the law —
but he had [merely delegated to Alex M. Azar
II](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/politics/defense-production-act-virus.html),
the secretary of health and human services, the ability to invoke that
law in theory. No company had been ordered to do anything.

As criticism over Mr. Trump’s inaction swelled, he [signed an
order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-order-defense-production-act-regarding-general-motors-company/)
telling Mr. Azar to use the law to push General Motors to make
ventilators. But G.M. said it had already decided by then to make
ventilators in partnership with Ventec, developed plans to source the
necessary parts and started preparing a factory in Kokomo, Ind., for
production.

Mr. Trump has a history of making head-turning claims about his powers
in other contexts. During the Russia investigation, for example, his
lawyers argued that [he could not be guilty of obstruction of
justice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/04/us/politics/obstruction-of-justice-trump-explained.html)
because his power over the Justice Department was absolute, and Mr.
Trump [repeatedly claimed he could fire the special
counsel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/10/us/politics/trump-firing-authority-mueller.html),
Robert S. Mueller III, if he wanted — even directly.

“Article II allows me to do whatever I want,” [he
said](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-abc-news-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-president/story?id=63749144).

Yet as the eventual report by Mr. Mueller showed, in practice Mr.
Trump’s power was weak. He [pushed subordinates to oust the special
counsel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/23/us/politics/trump-mueller-obstruction.html),
but they would not go along.

Mr. Goldsmith said that Mr. Trump’s approach to the pandemic crisis and
more had reflected a general pattern of loud words but incompetently
executed action on policies that were more complex than basic tasks like
issuing pardons and firing people, bogging down his efforts in court
battles and dysfunction rather than clear accomplishment.

“Trump wants it to seem like he is this really powerful guy being really
aggressive with executive power, but he’s not,” Mr. Goldsmith said.
“There has been a huge mismatch between his rhetoric and his actions.
He clearly seems to enjoy how people’s heads explode when he says this
stuff, even though it’s not matched by reality.”
