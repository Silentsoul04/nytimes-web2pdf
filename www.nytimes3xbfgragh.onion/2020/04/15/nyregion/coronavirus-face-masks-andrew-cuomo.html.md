# New York Orders Residents to Wear Masks in Public

</div>

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said all New Yorkers must wear face coverings when
social distancing is not possible, including on public transport, in
stores and on crowded sidewalks.

Imposing a stricter measure to control the spread of the coronavirus,
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he would start requiring
[people in New York to wear
masks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/nyregion/nypd-face-masks-nyc-protests.html)
or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.

The order will take effect on Friday and will apply to people who are
unable to keep six feet away from others in public settings, such as on
a bus or subway, on a crowded sidewalk or inside a grocery store.

“Stopping the spread is everything,” Mr. Cuomo said during his daily
briefing in Albany. “How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to
come close to a person?”

The new requirements are bound to make face coverings an inescapable and
perhaps jarring sight in New York City for the foreseeable future. They
could also introduce a level of mutual obligation and civic duty about
wearing masks in public that is more firmly established in Asia than in
the West.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Maryland also announced on Wednesday that it would require people to
wear masks in public.

Mr. Cuomo said local governments would enforce the order, but he noted
that riders without face coverings would not be ejected from public
transit. The pandemic has devastated New York’s public transit system,
with 59 workers having died of the virus and 2,269 testing positive for
the infection.

The state would consider issuing civil penalties to people who fail to
abide by the order, but not criminal penalties: “You’re not going to go
to jail for not wearing a mask,” Mr. Cuomo said.

Permitted face coverings include proper masks, as well as scarves or
bandannas, the governor said.

A similar rule was issued in New Jersey last week. The order, issued by
Gov. Philip D. Murphy, made it mandatory for all people inside stores
and other essential businesses to wear face coverings unless they are
under 2 years old or have a medical condition that prevents them from
wearing a
mask.

Signs have popped up at stores throughout New Jersey warning customers
that they will not be allowed in unless they cover their faces. Some
stores have taken a stronger stance, asking people without coverings to
leave.

“These restrictions that I have laid out must be followed throughout the
state,” Mr. Murphy said last week. “We are taking the step to protect
both customers and essential workers.”

The mandates were the latest public safety measures from two states that
are at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. New York and
New Jersey have worked in tandem since the outbreak reached the region,
shuttering nonessential businesses at the same time and recently forming
a coalition with neighboring states to coordinate the reopening of their
economies.

In announcing Maryland’s order on masks in public settings, Gov. Larry
Hogan said, “The wearing of masks is something we may have to become
more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state.”

New York, New Jersey and Maryland are so far the only states to have
issued broad orders mandating face coverings in most public settings,
according to the most recent information from the National Governors
Association. Puerto Rico and Guam have implemented similar measures.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Nonbinding guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention encourage people to wear face coverings in settings where
social distancing measures are difficult to maintain to prevent the
transmission of the virus. The infection spreads primarily through
droplets generated when, for instance, a sick person coughs or sneezes.

That federal recommendation was issued after research showed that many
people [were infected with the virus but did not show
symptoms](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html).

Across New Jersey, businesses were still grappling with the enforcement
of the new rules, which some people have flouted, leading to arrests in
some instances.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Supermarkets have posted signs on their doors telling customers they
cannot come in without a mask, but some shoppers have refused to wear
coverings and laughed off the requirement, said Matt Fattah, the owner
of a C-Town supermarket in Jersey City.

“A lot of people think they don’t have to follow the rules,” Mr. Fattah
said. “My employees are all on board, wear masks and gloves 100 percent
of the time. Customers, first few days, it was an issue. Like the bag
ban, a lot of customers thought it was a joke, that we were joking.”

Earlier this week, the owners of a toy store in Lakewood, a town near
the Jersey Shore, were charged with violating the order after police
spotted about 10 people crowded inside the shop. Only three of them were
wearing masks, according to the police.

And in Pleasantville, a town just west of Atlantic City, a 35-year-old
man was arrested on several charges, including violating emergency
orders, after he came into a Dunkin’ Donuts without a mask and refused
to leave after employees asked him to.

Col. Patrick J. Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police,
said the police would continue to cite and arrest those who ignored
orders mandating social distancing and the wearing of masks.

“Because lives are at stake, enforcement action will be taken without
hesitation against those who are blatantly placing the lives of others
at risk,” he said in a statement.

Mr. Murphy, the New Jersey governor, said it was up to businesses to set
their own policies on how to deal with customers who do not wear a face
covering.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The state order does allow people who refuse to wear a mask for medical
or other reasons to enter a store and spend a limited amount of time
shopping for essential goods, Parimal Garg, the state’s deputy chief
counsel, explained during Mr. Murphy’s briefing on April 8.

**“**I think that’s benevolent,” Mr. Murphy responded. “I’d prefer to
even be tougher than that.”

K.C. Rondello, a disaster epidemiologist at the College of Nursing and
Public Health at Adelphi University in New York, said the mask
requirement would ensure compliance from those who would otherwise
ignore voluntary guidelines.

“If ultimately these laws lead to greater compliance with social
distancing recommendations, then they will have a very real and
quantifiable effect on morbidity and mortality,” he said. “It may be
difficult for people to understand or appreciate the value of a face
covering. They may think, ‘What could a bandanna possibly do?’ But it
can make an enormous difference.”

In New York, Mr. Cuomo said the new measures were necessary as the state
continued to rein in the spread of the virus: On Tuesday, the three-day
average of the number of virus patients in hospitals — considered one of
the most reliable measures of the virus’s impact — fell for the first
time since the outbreak began.

“All people in public must have a mask or nose covering, mouth and nose
covering, and they must wear it in a situation where you cannot or are
not maintaining social distancing,” Mr. Cuomo said.

The governor said a mask was not necessary if, for example, a person was
walking down an empty street. But, he said, “You’re now at an
intersection and there are people at the intersection and you’re going
to be in proximity to other people? Put the mask on.”

He added, “You don’t have a right to infect me.”
