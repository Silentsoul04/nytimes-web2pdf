[Boeing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/business/boeing-layoffs-coronavirus.html)
plans to resume commercial airplane production in Washington State by
bringing about 27,000 employees back to work, the company said on
Thursday. Most will return by the end of next week.

The announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of
business activity by a U.S. corporation since the coronavirus outbreak
forced companies and government officials to shut down most nonessential
work. President Trump is encouraging businesses and states to reopen the
economy by May 1 or earlier.

“Following thorough reviews of local conditions, we’ve started restoring
operations at some sites where work has been suspended,” Boeing’s chief
executive, Dave Calhoun, said in a letter to employees ahead of the
announcement. This week, the company brought about 2,500 employees in
the state back to work, most of them focused on defense production
operations.

Of Boeing’s approximately 160,000 employees worldwide, there are at
least 66 current confirmed coronavirus cases. At least 124 others have
recovered after being infected.

The Seattle area was an early U.S. hot spot for coronavirus infections
and deaths. Washington State has recorded more than 10,000 confirmed
cases and [more than 550
deaths](https://www.doh.wa.gov/emergencies/coronavirus). But [spread of
the virus has
slowed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/29/us/seattle-washington-state-coronavirus-transmission-rate.html)
in recent weeks and experts have credited containment strategies put in
place by government officials and businesses.

Boeing employees who return to work in the coming week will find new
health and safety precautions in place, such as staggered start times
and spread-out work areas, the company said. But a company spokesman,
Charles Bickers, said Boeing would not test employees for the virus.

Face coverings will be required and provided to those who don’t bring
their own, and other personal protective equipment will be available to
employees who are unable to distance themselves from colleagues for
extended periods, the company said. Signs and floor markings will remind
employees to stay apart and workers will be asked to conduct wellness
checks on themselves before every shift and submit to temperature
screenings at many manufacturing sites.

“The health and safety of our employees, their families and communities
is our shared priority,” Stan Deal, president and chief executive of
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a statement. “This phased approach
ensures we have a reliable supply base, our personal protective
equipment is readily available and we have all of the necessary safety
measures in place to resume essential work for our customers.”

The returning employees will work on the company’s 747, 767, 777 and 787
planes. The company will also begin laying the groundwork to resume
production of the 737 Max, pending regulatory approval after being
grounded for about a year following two deadly accidents.

Boeing could find it difficult to reopen plants while taking precautions
to protect workers from the coronavirus, said Erik Gordon, a professor
at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

“Boeing has an established system of assembling aircraft and that system
was designed to be efficient at assembling aircraft,” Mr. Gordon said.
“It was not designed to be safe under pandemic conditions.”

That said, Mr. Gordon gave Boeing and other companies credit for letting
employees work from home where possible.

“No company should ask anybody who can telecommute to do anything else,”
he said.

The company employs about 72,000 people in Washington State. Between the
returning workers and those who are able to telecommute, most of
Boeing’s employees in the state will be back to work. The company said
it was not yet resuming production at its plant in South Carolina.

“We have talked about the prospect of Boeing reopening because they are
essential, and I’m glad they’ve committed to a robust use of P.P.E. and
workplace hygiene,” Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said in a statement.
“We hope to get more details on that, and our agencies will keep
talking with them to ensure workers feel safe going to work.”

In the letter to employees, Mr. Calhoun welcomed the news this week that
the nation’s major airlines and the Trump administration had reached an
agreement on the terms of $25 billion in government support that is
intended to pay airline workers.

“Knowing that the U.S. airline industry has critical financial support
through this devastating wave of the virus allows us to plan our
production system for the medium- and long-term impact on air travel,”
Mr. Calhoun said. “We are hopeful that governments around the world will
follow the lead of the U.S. and support their aviation industry in a
similar fashion.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Calhoun also said that the aerospace industry would need government
support, most likely in the form of loans.

“As you’ve heard me say before, we’re in uncharted waters. The impact of
this global virus will change our business for years to come,” he said.
“But we’re doing what it takes to emerge from it strong and
competitive.”
