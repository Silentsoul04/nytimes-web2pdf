With the coronavirus pandemic ravaging New York’s economy, Mayor Bill de
Blasio said on Thursday that the city will be forced to slash more than
$2 billion in municipal services over the next year.

All aspects of [New York
City](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/nyregion/nyc-budget-cuts.html)
life will be affected: Public pools will be closed; sanitation pickups
will be reduced. Fewer police traffic agents will be deployed at
intersections; overnight service on the Staten Island Ferry will be
reduced.

The cuts were part of a gloomy $89.3 billion executive
[budget](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/nyregion/nyc-budget-cuts.html)
that reflects the way that New York City has become the epicenter of the
global coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak has killed more than 10,000
city residents, shuttered thousands of businesses, emptied the city’s
once bustling hotels and darkened the lights on Broadway.

It has also cost hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers their jobs and
will deprive the city of $7.4 billion in tax revenue in fiscal years
2020 and 2021.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Things we would love to focus on in peacetime, we don’t get to focus on
in wartime,” Mr. de Blasio said at his daily briefing. “And this is in
effect wartime.”

The budget, which still requires City Council approval, is $3.5 billion
less than the one the city approved last year and $6 billion less than
the preliminary plan the mayor [introduced in
January](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/16/nyregion/budget-new-york-city.html).
The Council could restore some of the services the mayor is proposing be
cut.

Back then, the mayor warned that the city’s financial situation was
somewhat precarious because it was not clear how the state’s projected
$6 billion deficit might affect the city. But a far greater threat has
now been realized, forcing City Hall to make broad cuts across numerous
agencies.

“Things that might have been a priority two months ago, three months
ago, can’t be a priority right now,” Mr. de Blasio said.

The city will close all outdoor pools for the season, cut its Vision
Zero traffic safety program even though [pedestrian and cyclist
fatalities were on the
rise](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/01/nyregion/nyc-biking-deaths.html)
before the outbreak, and reduce through attrition 100 traffic agent
positions dedicated to intersection control.

The summer youth employment program and the collection of organic waste
will be suspended. Tree pruning and tree stump removal will be

freeze.

Before the outbreak, Mr. de Blasio had overseen a period of booming
growth in tax revenue and economic prosperity that had allowed him to
[spend
more](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/12/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-government-jobs.html)
than past mayors. But the city now projects a loss of 500,000 jobs over
the first three quarters of 2020, the end of a decade-long expansion of
jobs.

Most of those losses are expected in the second quarter, with retail,
leisure and the hospitality industry making up half the job losses.

“We don’t know when this crisis ends,” the mayor said. “We do know it
will end, that much we can say, thank God. But we don’t know when, we
don’t know how, and we know that the impact that’s been made on people
continues to grow, and we know that the loss of revenue could be even
greater.”

The mayor, a Democrat in his second term, said the budget focuses on
four basic measures of keeping city residents safe, healthy, housed and
fed.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“If we can’t provide the basics for our people, then you can kiss your
recovery goodbye,” Mr. de Blasio said.

City officials had to dip into savings to balance the budget, drawing
$900 million from the general reserve, $250 million from the capital
stabilization fund and $2.6 billion from the retiree health benefits
fund, a move that does not affect retiree benefits in the short term.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the costs of fighting the epidemic are growing. The city has spent
$700 million so far to fight the coronavirus and expects that number to
rise to $3.5 billion by the end of this calendar year. There is also
lingering uncertainty over how much state budget cuts will hurt the
city. Mr. de Blasio projected $800 million in funding losses from the
state.

The mayor repeated his call for the federal government to provide more
stimulus funds to cities and states. The mayor criticized the bailout of
the airline industry and said New York had received just $1.4 billion in
direct aid.

“How about bailing out the nation’s largest city? How about bailing out
the epicenter of this crisis where people have been suffering?” Mr. de
Blasio asked.

Asked how much aid he expected from the federal government, the mayor
said, “We need the federal government to make up all lost revenue.
Period.”

“Will the president speak up?” Mr. de Blasio asked. “If President Trump
raises his voice, the Republican Senate will
follow.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, speaking from a news conference in Albany, said
he’s had the same conversation with other local governments about
their looming budget deficits and has given the same answer: “We cannot
do it.”

“I have a 10 to 15 billion-dollar hole, so I’m not in any position to
help any of it. This is why I’ve said this is where the federal
government has to step in,” Mr. Cuomo said.

As pessimistic as the mayor’s budget plan is, the Independent Budget
Office suggests that the coronavirus pandemic may have an even more
devastating effect on New York City’s economy.

The Independent Budget Office projects that the city could lose 475,000
jobs starting in the second quarter of this year through the first
quarter of 2021. That would result in a loss of almost $10 billion in
tax revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, 33 percent more than the
mayor’s budget projection.

Mr. de Blasio acknowledged being worried that the city’s projected
revenue loss could grow by billions of dollars.

New York City may be uniquely affected by the virus because the city is
heavily dependent on the very industries — tourism, retail and
entertainment — that have been shut down by the stay-at-home order to
halt the spread of the virus.

Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council, said in a statement with
Council leaders that the Council wants to protect the most vulnerable
New Yorkers by continuing “critical” social services.

“These are unprecedented times, and we begin budget negotiations facing
challenges we have never faced before,” he said in the statement.

Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said that Mr.
de Blasio needs to make deeper cuts to the city’s work force, which has
[grown to a record number of
employees](https://cbcny.org/research/cost-growing-city-workforce)
during the mayor’s tenure, or face large budget deficits in upcoming
fiscal years.

“The budget provides stark evidence that we are not only in a health and
economic crisis but that the city is facing a fiscal crisis,” Mr. Rein
said.

Mayor de Blasio said that he considered employee layoffs a “last resort”
that he would only contemplate if the city does not receive enough
federal aid.
