With the city projecting a \$7.4 billion loss in tax revenue, municipal
services that ``can't be a priority right now'' are being slashed, Mayor
de Blasio said.

With the coronavirus pandemic ravaging New York's economy, Mayor Bill de
Blasio said on Thursday that the city will be forced to slash more than
\$2 billion in municipal services over the next year.

All aspects of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/nyregion/nyc-budget-cuts.html}{New
York City} life will be affected: Public pools will be closed;
sanitation pickups will be reduced. Fewer police traffic agents will be
deployed at intersections; overnight service on the Staten Island Ferry
will be reduced.

The cuts were part of a gloomy \$89.3 billion executive
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/nyregion/nyc-budget-cuts.html}{budget}
that reflects the way that New York City has become the epicenter of the
global coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak has killed more than 10,000
city residents, shuttered thousands of businesses, emptied the city's
once bustling hotels and darkened the lights on Broadway.

It has also cost hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers their jobs and
will deprive the city of \$7.4 billion in tax revenue in fiscal years
2020 and 2021.

``Things we would love to focus on in peacetime, we don't get to focus
on in wartime,'' Mr. de Blasio said at his daily briefing. ``And this is
in effect wartime.''

The budget, which still requires City Council approval, is \$3.5 billion
less than the one the city approved last year and \$6 billion less than
the preliminary plan the mayor
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/16/nyregion/budget-new-york-city.html}{introduced
in January}. The Council could restore some of the services the mayor is
proposing be cut.

Back then, the mayor warned that the city's financial situation was
somewhat precarious because it was not clear how the state's projected
\$6 billion deficit might affect the city. But a far greater threat has
now been realized, forcing City Hall to make broad cuts across numerous
agencies.

``Things that might have been a priority two months ago, three months
ago, can't be a priority right now,'' Mr. de Blasio said.

The city will close all outdoor pools for the season, cut its Vision
Zero traffic safety program even though
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/01/nyregion/nyc-biking-deaths.html}{pedestrian
and cyclist fatalities were on the rise} before the outbreak, and reduce
through attrition 100 traffic agent positions dedicated to intersection
control.

The summer youth employment program and the collection of organic waste
will be suspended. Tree pruning and tree stump removal will be
curtailed. There will be a hiring freeze.

Before the outbreak, Mr. de Blasio had overseen a period of booming
growth in tax revenue and economic prosperity that had allowed him to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/12/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-government-jobs.html}{spend
more} than past mayors. But the city now projects a loss of 500,000 jobs
over the first three quarters of 2020, the end of a decade-long
expansion of jobs.

Most of those losses are expected in the second quarter, with retail,
leisure and the hospitality industry making up half the job losses.

``We don't know when this crisis ends,'' the mayor said. ``We do know it
will end, that much we can say, thank God. But we don't know when, we
don't know how, and we know that the impact that's been made on people
continues to grow, and we know that the loss of revenue could be even
greater.''

The mayor, a Democrat in his second term, said the budget focuses on
four basic measures of keeping city residents safe, healthy, housed and
fed.

``If we can't provide the basics for our people, then you can kiss your
recovery goodbye,'' Mr. de Blasio said.

City officials had to dip into savings to balance the budget, drawing
\$900 million from the general reserve, \$250 million from the capital
stabilization fund and \$2.6 billion from the retiree health benefits
fund, a move that does not affect retiree benefits in the short term.

But the costs of fighting the epidemic are growing. The city has spent
\$700 million so far to fight the coronavirus and expects that number to
rise to \$3.5 billion by the end of this calendar year. There is also
lingering uncertainty over how much state budget cuts will hurt the
city. Mr. de Blasio projected \$800 million in funding losses from the
state.

The mayor repeated his call for the federal government to provide more
stimulus funds to cities and states. The mayor criticized the bailout of
the airline industry and said New York had received just \$1.4 billion
in direct aid.

``How about bailing out the nation's largest city? How about bailing out
the epicenter of this crisis where people have been suffering?'' Mr. de
Blasio asked.

Asked how much aid he expected from the federal government, the mayor
said, ``We need the federal government to make up all lost revenue.
Period.''

``Will the president speak up?'' Mr. de Blasio asked. ``If President
Trump raises his voice, the Republican Senate will follow.''

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, speaking from a news conference in Albany, said
he's had the same conversation with other local governments about their
looming budget deficits and has given the same answer: ``We cannot do
it.''

``I have a 10 to 15 billion-dollar hole, so I'm not in any position to
help any of it. This is why I've said this is where the federal
government has to step in,'' Mr. Cuomo said.

As pessimistic as the mayor's budget plan is, the Independent Budget
Office suggests that the coronavirus pandemic may have an even more
devastating effect on New York City's economy.

The Independent Budget Office projects that the city could lose 475,000
jobs starting in the second quarter of this year through the first
quarter of 2021. That would result in a loss of almost \$10 billion in
tax revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, 33 percent more than the
mayor's budget projection.

Mr. de Blasio acknowledged being worried that the city's projected
revenue loss could grow by billions of dollars.

New York City may be uniquely affected by the virus because the city is
heavily dependent on the very industries --- tourism, retail and
entertainment --- that have been shut down by the stay-at-home order to
halt the spread of the virus.

Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council, said in a statement with
Council leaders that the Council wants to protect the most vulnerable
New Yorkers by continuing ``critical'' social services.

``These are unprecedented times, and we begin budget negotiations facing
challenges we have never faced before,'' he said in the statement.

Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said that Mr.
de Blasio needs to make deeper cuts to the city's work force, which has
\href{https://cbcny.org/research/cost-growing-city-workforce}{grown to a
record number of employees} during the mayor's tenure, or face large
budget deficits in upcoming fiscal years.

``The budget provides stark evidence that we are not only in a health
and economic crisis but that the city is facing a fiscal crisis,'' Mr.
Rein said.

Mayor de Blasio said that he considered employee layoffs a ``last
resort'' that he would only contemplate if the city does not receive
enough federal aid.
