It’s the money. With [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-fact-check.html),
that never changes. The Dow at 30,000 was his obsession. Get to that
number and the November election was a lock. Maybe even win with 400
Electoral College votes. A landslide\!

The index came close. It was at its high of 29,551 on Feb. 12, more than
three weeks after President Xi Jinping of China, his disastrous delaying
tactics exhausted, warned that the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-fact-check.html)
outbreak “[must be taken
seriously.](https://apnews.com/14d7dcffa205d9022fa9ea593bb2a8c5)” A
Nasdaq record high followed on Feb. 19, almost three weeks after the
World Health Organization declared a “global health emergency.”

“We have it totally under control.” That was [Trump’s message at the
time](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html).
Jared Kushner, Trump’s de facto campaign manager, liked that. So did
Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Don’t spook the markets\!
Champagne on ice\! Trump’s path to re-election involved getting enough
Americans to say, *I can’t stand this guy but, hell, I’m making money.*

This sordid calculation meant the opportunity to avert the Covid-19
disaster was lost. Warnings were ignored. Chaos prevailed, starting at
the top with a president who can no more think through a process than
feel empathy.

Effective testing was not developed. Medical supplies, masks and
protective suits were not procured. As my colleagues have reported,
Trump was furious in late February when [a blunt
warning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html)
from a senior health official contributed to a market dive.

“One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear,” Trump said of the
virus on Feb. 27. On March 7, guests [danced in a conga line at
Mar-a-Lago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-mar-a-lago.html)
as Trump hosted family and his buddy-in-bravado, President Jair
Bolsonaro of Brazil, who has called the virus “a little flu.”

Seven weeks later, the plague so cavalierly dismissed has taken the
lives of at least 30,000 in the United States. The number of jobless
claims has reached 22 million. The Dow has sunk. Wall Street will not
save Trump. Time for a Plan B. More on that later.

When the Pearl Harbor Commission on this American catastrophe convenes,
even Trump the perennial escape artist will not be able to slither from
history’s judgment.

There’s nobody left in the presidential entourage who can question his
folly. The toadying of Vice President Mike Pence captures the terror
that reigns in Trump’s off-with-his-head court.

Court is the appropriate word. “When somebody’s the president of the
United States, the authority is total,” [Trump said this
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-governors.html).
Prompting Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York to the timely reminder, “We
don’t have a king in this country.”

The thing is, Trump *is* the king. He’s Mark Twain’s king, more
precisely. He’s the great American swindler, relying on the vastness of
American space to afford him the opportunity to stay just ahead of
disaster by conjuring up one more tall story. Twain’s king and duke in
“Huckleberry Finn” — claiming to be the dauphin of King Louis XVI of
France and the usurped Duke of Bridgewater — lie and scam their way down
the Mississippi in the quintessentially American story.

“I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,” Trump
says on March 17. Twain would have seen material in the grotesqueness of
that. The more fantastic the story, the more it muddies the waters.
Trump needs very muddy waters because he’s a petrified coward.

In his whole born-on-third-base life, he has never been held accountable
for anything. And so of course he walks back from his claim of absolute
authority and tells governors to “[call your own
shots](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/16/politics/donald-trump-reopening-guidelines-coronavirus/index.html)”
on reopening the economy. His guidelines give him a veneer of authority
without actual responsibility. No buck should stop in the Oval Office.

In his daily TV ramblings, he tries to blame anyone and anything, the
World Health Organization being the latest. Trump’s genius lies in a
sinister capacity to ignore reality and create another by getting
people’s blood up in a whirlwind of chaos and distraction. That is how
he got to the Oval Office and how he could remain there.

Plan B is already evident. The disparaged virus that could sink the
market and blow up the path to victory is now the pandemic with
electoral potential. Doesn’t corona mean crown, after all? It gives
Trump a daily reality TV show. It attacks cities more than rural areas,
where his vote is concentrated. It permits him to have the Internal
Revenue Service send out stimulus checks for $1,200
[with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/coming-to-your-1200-relief-check-donald-j-trumps-name/2020/04/14/071016c2-7e82-11ea-8013-1b6da0e4a2b7_story.html)[*Trump’s
name on
them*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/coming-to-your-1200-relief-check-donald-j-trumps-name/2020/04/14/071016c2-7e82-11ea-8013-1b6da0e4a2b7_story.html)*.*
It creates potential scope for him to claim emergency powers that allow
electoral skulduggery. He knows that the Mitch McConnell-stacked Supreme
Court will either rule for him or make sure things are slow-rolled
enough to protect him. That’s his ultimate source of impunity — not what
the founders had in mind.

The other Plan B element is the great attack on China. Trump,
grotesquely, praised China’s “transparency.” Forget that. China-U.S.
tensions will ratchet up in the next six months.

[“Beijing
Biden”](https://www.axios.com/biggest-trump-super-pac-test-drives-beijingbiden-campaign-75582a64-6edc-48ec-9b38-f307816b6a32.html)
is the new Trump offensive. He will hammer the presumptive Democratic
nominee for supposed weakness on China. He has some ammunition. Trump is
weak on American democracy, which is why Biden needs to shape up right
now and save it. His focus, cutting through the Trump turbulence, needs
to be more unerring than we’ve seen to date.
