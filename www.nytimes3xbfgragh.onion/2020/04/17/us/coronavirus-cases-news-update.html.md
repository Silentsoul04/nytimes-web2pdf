pandemic*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-updates.html)*.*

## Trump calls to “LIBERATE” states where people are protesting social distancing restrictions.

President Trump on Friday [openly encouraged right-wing
protests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-governors.html)
of social distancing restrictions in states with stay-at-home orders, a
day after announcing guidelines for how the nation’s governors should
carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own
timetables.

In a series of all-caps tweets that started two minutes after a Fox News
report on the
[protesters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/20/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html),
the president declared, “[LIBERATE
MICHIGAN](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130)\!”
and “[LIBERATE
MINNESOTA](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251168994066944003)\!”
— two states whose Democratic governors have imposed strict social
distancing restrictions. He also [lashed out at
Virginia](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372),
where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for
strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your
great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege\!”

His stark departure from the more bipartisan tone of his [announcement
on Thursday
night](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-guidelines.html)
suggested Mr. Trump was ceding any semblance of national leadership on
the pandemic, and choosing instead to divide the country by playing to
his political base.

Echoed across the internet and on cable television by conservative
pundits and ultraright conspiracy theorists, his tweets were a
remarkable example of a president egging on demonstrators and helping to
stoke an angry fervor that in its anti-government rhetoric was eerily
reminiscent of the birth of the Tea Party movement a decade ago.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump’s call for liberation from social distancing rules followed
protests around the country as protesters — many wearing red “Make
America Great Again” hats — congregated in packed groups around state
capitols to demand that restrictions be immediately lifted and to
demonize their Democratic governors.

In Michigan, protesters waved banners in support of Mr. Trump and
protested Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by chanting, “Lock her up.” In St. Paul,
Minn., a group calling itself “Liberate Minnesota” rallied against
stay-at-home orders in front of the home of Gov. Tim Walz. In Columbus,
Ohio, protesters crowded closely together as they pressed up against the
doors of the state’s Capitol.

Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said Mr. Trump’s tweets “encourage illegal
and dangerous acts” and said the president was “putting millions of
people in danger of contracting Covid-19.”

Mr. Inslee added: “His unhinged rantings and calls for people to
‘liberate’ states could also lead to violence. We’ve seen it before.”

And in Michigan, Ms. Whitmer said she hoped the president’s comments
would not incite more protests.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Any effort by states to begin to ease restrictions requires an expanded
testing capacity to give people a sense of security, health experts say,
and the [country is far
behind](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-testing-trump.html)
in conducting enough tests to responsibly inform those decisions.

But Vice President Mike Pence asserted on Friday that the United States
currently has the testing capacity to allow all states to move to begin
the first phase of the White House’s
[guidelines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/) for reopening
their economies.

“Our best scientists and health experts assess that today we have a
sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of phase one
reopening if state governors should choose to do that,” Mr. Pence said
at the White House’s daily briefing. He was followed by several top
public health officials, who provided a detailed description of the
nation’s testing capacity, whose scale they said was underappreciated.

Speaking after Mr. Pence, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s
top infectious disease expert, said that “existing capacity” for testing
nationwide can be utilized, but used the future tense when discussing
the potential for states to scale back social distancing measures. “We
will have, and there will be enough tests to take this country safely
through phase one,” Dr. Fauci said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The numbers the officials cited in the briefing — 3.7 million tests so
far, and about 120,000 tests per day — represent the current snapshot of
testing in the United States. But experts said that testing will have to
be drastically expanded to get an accurate picture of how the virus is
spreading around the country, and to be able to stamp out future
outbreaks. The ultimate goal is to separate the sick from the healthy so
that Americans feel safe returning to a somewhat normal life and the
virus does not sweep through communities again, which requires more
widespread testing.

The capacity for such testing has been growing but not fast enough,
public health experts say. Supplies continue to run out and some areas
are still only testing people who present specific symptoms. Tests to
determine whether someone has already had the virus are slowly rolling
out, but most have not been vetted by the Food and Drug Administration.

State health officials and medical providers nationwide say they still
cannot diagnose as many people as they need. The biggest challenge is
gettingthe supplies needed to process tests, including chemical
reagents, swabs and pipettes. Manufacturers of those supplies are facing
a huge global demand.

Without widespread testing and surveillance, said Angela Rasmussen, a
virologist at Columbia University in New York, “we won’t be able to
quickly identify and isolate cases in which the patients are
presymptomatic or asymptomatic, and thus community transmission could be
re-established.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump, whose administration has been criticized for its slow rollout
of tests as the virus took hold in the United States, again [sought to
portray testing as a state
responsibility](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251186839983132673?s=20)
on Friday, even as many governors are pleading for more federal help.

At his briefing at the White House on Friday evening, Mr. Trump
dismissed the concerns that public health experts have raised about
testing, claiming that “the United States has the most robust, advanced
and accurate testing system anywhere in the world.” He rejected
criticisms of its shortcomings as “false and misleading” and reiterated
his position that “the governors are responsible for testing.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Earlier Friday, a telephone call between Mr. Pence and Senate Democrats
grew heated as Democrats pressed the vice president about the lack of
testing. Senator Angus King, the independent senator from Maine, called
the lack of national testing a “dereliction of duty.”

In recent weeks, the F.D.A. has approved new tests that could make doing
testing easier, such as one that measures the level of virus in saliva
and does not need a swab. The F.D.A. [also recently said a new kind of
swab](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-gates-foundation-unitedhealth-group-quantigen-and-us-cotton)
could be used to test for the virus, a polyester type that can be
quickly manufactured in the millions. Both the saliva test and the
polyester swab were cited by officials during the
briefing.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In another series of tweets on Friday, the president [rekindled a fight
with Gov. Andrew M.
Cuomo](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251181563506757632)
of New York, only days after heaping praise on him, by saying that the
state’s chief executive should “spend more time ‘doing’ and less time
‘complaining.’”

The retort came after Mr. Cuomo said that New York could not fully
reopen its economy without more widespread testing and help from the
federal government. Even before Mr. Cuomo had finished speaking during
his televised daily briefing, [Mr. Trump lashed out,
tweeting](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251181563506757632?s=20),
“We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn’t need or use,
gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had, and helped
you with testing that you should be doing.” He said Mr. Cuomo owed the
federal government a thank-you.

“First of all, if he’s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up
and go to work, right?” Mr. Cuomo responded in real time. “Second, let’s
keep emotion and politics out of this, and personal ego if we can.
Because this is about the people.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cuomo said another 630 people died of the virus in New York on
Thursday, according to official state figures, bringing the total
confirmed death toll to 12,822. He said the toll was “breathtaking in
its pain and grief and
tragedy.”

The protests in Michigan, Ohio and elsewhere calling for easing the
restrictions were reminiscent of the early days of the Tea Party
movement, when angry activists stormed town hall meetings of Democratic
members of Congress to protest President Barack Obama’s health care
overhaul. Both featured impassioned demonstrators on the ground — and
the behind-the-scenes involvement of prominent conservatives and donors.

The chairman of one of the groups behind Michigan’s protest on Thursday,
the Michigan Freedom Fund, is Greg McNeilly, a close longtime associate
of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Mr. McNeilly has denied any
involvement by Ms. DeVos or others in her family, which has long
financed conservative causes in Michigan.

Others organizing protests have been open about the involvement of
outside donors.

Speaking on a [YouTube
program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h7czFYx6-s&feature=youtu.be&t=856)
called “Freedom on Tap,” the Trump-allied economics commentator Stephen
Moore said he was “working with a group in Wisconsin that wants to do a
drive-in,” which he equated to the sit-ins of the civil rights era, only
this time in protest of the restrictions put in place by Gov. Tony
Evers, a Democrat.

Speaking of the planned Wisconsin rally, he said he had one big donor
who had promised to pay the bail and legal fees of anyone who was
arrested.

“So this is a great time, gentlemen and ladies, for civil disobedience,”
Mr. Moore said. “We need to be the Rosa Parks here, and protest against
these government injustices.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Moore serves on Mr. Trump’s coronavirus economic advisory group and
has helped start another group urging a faster reopening of the economy,
called Save Our Country.

Mr. Trump had briefly considered Mr. Moore last year for a seat on the
Federal Reserve board, but Mr. Moore’s past comments about women,
including that they should not earn more than men, drew criticism.

In an interview, Mr. Moore declined to name the donor he was referring
to, but described him as “so upset about what’s happening with the
abridgment of freedom.”

Likening the latest protests to the Tea Party, he said that to focus on
donors is to miss true wellsprings of anger among everyday people.
“These are people coming to us, but we’re not coming to them,” he
said. “All we’re trying to do is just encourage people to participate.”

## The federal government will direct $19 billion in aid to farmers.

President Trump said on Friday he would channel $19 billion to American
farmers and ranchers who have been hurt by the fallout from the
coronavirus, payments that come on top of tens of billions of dollars of
assistance given to farmers in the last year to offset the pain of the
trade war with China.

Most of the aid — $16 billion — will be in the form of direct payments
to farmers who have experienced losses from the outbreak, Mr. Trump said
in a briefing. The government will also buy $3 billion worth of fresh
produce, dairy and meat that will be distributed to people in need
through food banks and other community and faith organizations, he
added.

“These are great people, great Americans,” Mr. Trump said of farmers.
“It is money well deserved. Not only were they targeted at one point
by China, and that was over a period of time, and you saw that
happening, and they never complained.”

The Trump administration has extended $28 billion to American farmers
and ranchers over the past year to help offset the pain of the
president’s trade war with China. Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on
hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in an effort to
reach a trade deal, prompting China to respond with tariffs on American
soybeans, pork, dairy and other products that crippled sales to one of
the world’s largest markets.

The spread of the coronavirus has further disrupted agricultural supply
chains. Outbreaks have shuttered meat processing plants, while the
closure of restaurants and food service, a major consumer of American
food products, means some dairy farmers have been forced to dump their
milk.

“Having to dump milk or plow under vegetables ready to market is not
only financially distressing, but it’s heartbreaking as well to those
who produce them,” Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, said in
the
briefing.

## At least 7,000 people living in or connected to U.S. nursing homes have died.

The first warning of the devastation that the coronavirus could wreak
inside American nursing homes came in late February, when residents of
a[facility in suburban
Seattle](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/21/us/coronavirus-nursing-home-kirkland-life-care.html)
perished, one by one, as families waited helplessly outside.

In the ensuing six weeks, large and shockingly lethal outbreaks have
continued to ravage nursing homes across the nation. Now a tally by The
New York Times has found the number of people living in or connected to
nursing homes who have died of the coronavirus to be at least 7,000, far
higher than previously known.

In New Jersey, 17 bodies piled up in a nursing home morgue, and more
than a quarter of a Virginia home’s residents have died. At least 24
people at a facility in Maryland have died; more than 100 residents and
workers have been infected at another in Kansas; and people have died in
centers for military veterans in Florida, Nevada, New York, Maine,
Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over all, about a fifth of deaths from the virus in the United States
have been tied to nursing homes or other long-term care facilities, The
Times review of cases shows. And more than 36,000 residents and
employees across the nation have contracted it.

Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States this
year than the seasonal flu, but determining just how deadly the new
virus will be [is a key
question](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html)
facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that
could [last
into 2022](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/14/science.abb5793).

The virus is known to be more deadly to aging, immune-compromised
people, and small, confined settings like nursing homes, where workers
frequently move from one room to the next, are particularly vulnerable
to spreading infection. But oversights and failures also have
contributed to the crisis.

In interviews with more than two dozen workers in long-term care
facilities as well as family members of residents and health care
experts, a portrait emerged of a system unequipped to handle the
onslaught and disintegrating further amid the growing
crisis.

Around the country, governors began announcing plans to ease
restrictions in their states on Friday, even as cases continue to surge
in some parts of the country and inadequate testing will make it
difficult for them to identify and contain future outbreaks.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said that he would lift
restrictions on some medical procedures and reopen state parks while
requiring masks and social distancing. Schools will remain closed for
the remainder of the school year.

In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine described what things might look like
beginning May 1: new social distancing guidelines at businesses,
employees wearing masks, and staggered arrival times and lunch times.

“Businesses won’t be able to attract workers or customers if they feel
they aren’t safe there,” said Mr. DeWine, a Republican. “A lot of this
will be common sense and taking what we’ve learned so far and putting it
into effect.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Friday that he would refer to the
[White House guidelines on
reopening](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-guidelines.html)
but not necessarily abide by everything they propose.

“We will obviously use that as a kind of baseline,” Mr. DeSantis, a
Republican, said at a news conference in Fort Lauderdale. “It doesn’t
mean Florida is going to do every single thing they say or not say.”

But just as much of the country entered life under quarantine in a
patchwork fashion, it is poised to ease restrictions the same varied
way, responding to the[local needs to fight the

In Maryland, where cases and deaths continue to rise, Gov. Larry Hogan,

“solidly in place” before he moves to lift restrictions: expanded
testing, increased hospital capacity for a surge in patients, more
personal protective equipment, and a robust contact tracing operation.
He said that he would give an update on the progress in those areas, and
detail the state’s plans, next week. State officials said that schools
there would remain closed through at least May 15.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a bipartisan economic advisory
committee on Friday that includes all four of the state’s living former
governors and some of the nation’s leading corporate executives

## Dallas homeless shelter is evacuated after 38 positive tests.

A Dallas homeless shelter [was
evacuated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/us/dallas-homeless-shelter-coronavirus.html)
on Friday after 38 residents tested positive for the coronavirus,
another example of the pandemic sweeping through one of the nation’s
most vulnerable populations.

City officials said 164 residents at the privately run shelter, Dallas
Life, were taken by bus to a hotel on Friday, and would be isolated in
individual rooms for 14 days while the shelter was cleaned. Nobody was
hospitalized, according to the shelter’s director, Bob Sweeney.

Mr. Sweeney said the shelter, which can house as many as 500 people,
stopped taking new residents and reduced its staffing to a skeleton crew
of about 12 in mid-March, as the pandemic escalated.

About eight days ago, he said, a resident with a fever tested positive
for the virus. Two more residents tested positive this week, prompting
health officials to order that everyone in the shelter be tested.

For weeks doctors around the country have been giving hydroxychloroquine
to ill patients, and as a preventive measure to some who have been
exposed to the coronavirus.

But even after treating hundreds of patients with the antimalarial drug,
doctors interviewed did not report clear results or remarkable
recoveries that can be traced to the drug.

At Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, most
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=STYLN_coronahub&variant=show&region=header&context=menu)
patients who are not on the verge of dying receive a five-day regimen of
hydroxychloroquine, the long-used malaria drug that President Trump has
repeatedly promoted as a “what have you got to lose” remedy. While his
own top health officials are more cautious — noting there is limited
evidence about the drug’s benefits — doctors across the country have
been prescribing the drug for weeks.

Dr. Bushra Mina, the chief of pulmonary medicine at Lenox Hill, is well
aware that there are no rigorous clinical trials showing that the drug
works. But he can’t wait for the evidence to come in, he said, when
people are dying.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I think it’s a battle, and your options are very limited,” Dr. Mina
said. “You’re really looking for what you can do with whatever evidence
you have.”

Hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, have been used for
decades to treat and prevent malaria, and hydroxychloroquine has been
used by people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis because it is known
to calm the immune system. In laboratory tests, it has been shown to
block the coronavirus from invading cells, although it hasn’t been
proven in human trials. The drugs are not recommended for people who
have abnormal heart rhythms.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

## A South Dakota mayor wrestles with the need for a stay-at-home order amid a local outbreak.

Mayor Paul TenHaken of Sioux Falls, S.D., has abandoned his effort to
put in place a stay-at-home order in his city, which is at the center of
a coronavirus outbreak that [shut down a Smithfield pork processing
plant](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/us/coronavirus-south-dakota-meat-plant-refugees.html).

He told the City Council on Friday that new data showed that local
hospitals were able to handle an influx of coronavirus patients, [The
Sioux Falls Argus Leader
reported](https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/crime/2020/04/17/coronavirus-update-covid-19-sioux-falls-after-cdc-tours-smithfield/5151219002/).

Earlier this week, Mr. TenHaken, a Republican, said in an interview that
he was frustrated by his inability to convince Sioux Falls residents to
stay in their homes. He had unsuccessfully petitioned Gov. Kristi Noem,
a Republican, for a countywide stay-at-home order.

“We’re starting to become a poster child for a lack of response,” he
said, noting that hundreds of people in his city had tested positive for
the coronavirus, many of whom worked at Smithfield.

The people in his city were deeply divided over his efforts to institute
a stay-at-home order. “I have half the city saying, ‘Shut this entire
place down and tell me when to come out,’” he said. “And I have the
other half saying, ‘Don’t you
dare.’”

## Tim Cook, Bob Iger, Janet Yellen and former governors join California’s bipartisan economic advisory council.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a bipartisan economic advisory
committee on Friday that includes all four of the state’s living former
governors and some of the nation’s leading corporate executives
including the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, and the chairman of
Disney, Robert A. Iger, as well as the former head of the Federal
Reserve, Janet Yellen.

The former governors are two Republicans, Pete Wilson and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and two Democrats, Gray Davis and Jerry Brown. The
committee will be led by Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman and
former presidential candidate.

Mr. Steyer said the committee’s aim would be “to develop a strategy to
help California recover as fast as safely possible from the Covid-19
induced recession.”

“Health and safety remain the most important points here,” Mr. Steyer
said.

Mr. Newsom’s initiative to call on his predecessors is in contrast to
President Trump who was asked in March whether he would consult with
previous presidents for guidance on how to navigate the crisis. “I don’t
think I’m going to learn much,” Mr. Trump [said at the
time](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fbriefings-statements%2Fremarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-8%2F&v=3).

## Small Business Administration loans have so far flowed heavily to California and Texas.

Money from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection
Program, which ran out of funds on Thursday, flowed heavily to
California and Texas, with construction companies and manufacturers
getting the largest number of loans, rather than harder-hit retailers
and restaurants, according to [new
data](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/SBA%20PPP%20Loan%20Report%20Deck.pdf).

The nearly $350 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program also
disproportionately flowed to states that have suffered fewer infections
and deaths under the virus, like Kansas, than to harder-hit states like
New York and New Jersey, when adjusting for the size of the
small-business economy in each state.

The new data, which include loan approvals through Thursday, show
accommodation and food service firms have received less than 9 percent
of the money from the program, about $30.5 billion, though they have
suffered the largest job losses of any industry during this recession.
Construction firms received the largest share, at just over 13 percent
or about $45 billion worth.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The program was designed for banks to distribute the loans, which the
federal government will pay off in most cases. That structure advantaged
companies with existing relationships with banks.

S.B.A. officials included data on the largest lending institutions in
the program, though they were not identified. The top lender distributed
more than $14 million in loans with an average size of more than
$500,000 per loan — suggesting that the institution was giving loans to
relatively large businesses.

Meanwhile, stocks in the United States rallied on Friday, with efforts
to reopen the economy taking center stage and investors undeterred by
more data showing the economic damage.

The gains came after Mr. Trump [told
governors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-guidelines.html)
they could begin reopening, and Boeing — one of the nation’s largest
manufacturers — said it planned to [bring about 27,000 employees back to
work in Washington
State](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/business/boeing-restart-production-coronavirus.html)
to resume aircraft production.

The announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of
business activity by a U.S. corporation since the much of the country
most nonessential work. The S\&P 500 rose 2.7 percent, while Boeing’s
gains led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 3 percent jump.

After global stock markets nose-dived earlier this year, they have been
rebounding since late March, as investors have routinely looked past
evidence of the economic damage, and instead focused on hopes for an
eventual recovery. Friday’s gains mean stocks ended the week higher,
despite reports showing a historic plunge in retail sales and a
continued surge in unemployment

Coroners in some parts of the United States are overwhelmed. Funeral
homes in [virus hot
spots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/podcasts/the-daily/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-coronavirus.html)
can barely keep up. Newspaper obituary pages in hard-hit areas go on and
on. Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States
this year than the seasonal flu.

But determining just how deadly the new virus will be is a key question
facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that
could [last
into 2022](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/14/science.abb5793).

As the virus spread across the world in late February and March, [the
projection circulated by infectious disease
experts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html)
of how many infected people would die [seemed plenty
dire](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf):
[around 1
percent](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4860450/user-clip-dr-anthony-fauci-addresses-covid-19-mortality-rate),
or 10 times the rate of a typical flu.

But according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the
death rate by dividing total deaths by the [number of known
cases](https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html),
about 6.4 percent of people infected with the virus have now died
worldwide.

In Italy, the [death rate stands at about 13
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-cases.html),
and in the [United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
around 4.3 percent, according to the latest figures on known cases and
deaths. Even in South Korea, where widespread testing helped contain the
outbreak, 2 percent of people who tested positive for the virus have
died, [recent data
shows](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries).

Those supposed death rates also appear to vary widely by geography:
Germany’s fatality rate appears to be roughly [one-tenth of
Italy’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html),
and Los Angeles’s about half of New York’s. Among U.S. states, Michigan,
at around 7 percent, is at the high end, while Wyoming, which reported
its first two deaths this week, has one of the lowest death rates, at
about 0.7 percent.

Aboard the hospital ship U.S.N.S. Mercy, docked in the Port of Los
Angeles, most of the military crew is moving off the ship and into
hotels ashore. Sailors will be bussed from their hotels to to work their
shifts aboard the Mercy. Navy spokesman Lt. Andrew Bertucci said on
Friday that the decision was made in order to better facilitate social
distancing.

“The plan is to drastically decrease the amount of contact that the crew
has with each other,” Lieutenant Bertucci said. “It will ultimately be
safer for both the crew and the patients.”

Between 800 to 900 crew members had been living on the Mercy full-time,
but that number will go down to about 100 to 200 in the coming days. On
Thursday 150 sailors moved off the ship, and that same number is
expected to move to hotels daily through Sunday. Lieutenant Bertucci
noted that the crew aboard the U.S.N.S. Comfort, which is docked in New
York City, recently moved most of its crew to hotels ashore as well.

The move comes after a total of seven crew members tested positive for
Covid-19 since the ship arrived to help area hospitals treat non-Covid
patients, and more than 100 of the crew who had been in contact with
those seven have moved off the ship into precautionary quarantine. All
of the Mercy sailors in quarantine have tested negative for the
coronavirus and are regularly monitored in case they were to develop any
symptoms.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The commanding officer of the Mercy’s medical treatment team, Capt. John
Rotruck, is quarantined aboard the ship in his stateroom after an
investigation found that he had been in proximity to a Covid-positive
crew member. Captain Rotruck has tested negative for novel coronavirus,
and said his ability to continue the ship’s mission is unchanged.

The ship will continue to treat the patients it already has onboard, and
will take new patients as requested by local authorities.

## There are 29 dead at one N.Y. nursing home. Or more. No one will say.

Berna Lee got the call from the nursing home in Queens on April 3: Her
mother had a fever, nothing serious. She was assured that there were no
cases in the home. Then she started calling workers there.

“One said, ‘Girl, let me tell you, it’s crazy here,’” Ms. Lee said.
“‘Six people died today.’”

In a panic, Ms. Lee drove from her home in Rhode Island to the nursing
home, beginning a two-week scramble for information, as workers at the
facility, [Sapphire Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing of Central
Queens](https://www.sapphirerehab.com/), told her privately that many
residents had died, and that most of the home’s leadership was out sick
or in quarantine.

Finally, she banged on her mother’s first-floor window to see if she was
OK. It was unclear whether her mother understood what was happening, Ms.
Lee said.

“I didn’t know how bad it was,” she said. “People told me bodies were
dropping.”

The crisis at Sapphire highlighted [the desperate state of nursing homes
in the New York
region](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/11/nyregion/nursing-homes-deaths-coronavirus.html)
and illustrated what relatives of residents said was a deeply troubling
lack of information about what was going on inside the
homes.

Chinese officials on Friday said the world’s second-largest economy [had
shrunk](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/business/china-coronavirus-economy.html)
in the first three months of the year, ending [a streak of untrammeled
growth](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/11/25/world/asia/china-economy-strategy.html)
that survived [the Tiananmen Square
crackdown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/30/world/asia/china-tiananmen-crackdown.html),
[the SARS
epidemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/03/business/economy/SARS-coronavirus-economic-impact-china.html)
and even the global financial crisis.

The data reflects China’s drastic efforts to stamp out the coronavirus,
which included shutting down most factories and offices in January and
February as the outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people.

The stark numbers make clear how monumental the challenge of getting the
global economy back on its feet will be, and may help to explain why
world leaders — including President Trump — are so eager to restart
their own economies. Since it emerged from abject poverty and isolation
more than 40 years ago, China has become perhaps the world’s [most
important growth
engine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/02/business/economy/china-coronavirus-economy.html).

But the leaders in Beijing have faced criticism over a lack of
transparency in their handling of the epidemic.

Faced with [mounting skepticism over its official
figures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/02/us/politics/cia-coronavirus-china.html),
China on Friday revised up its death toll in the central city where the
coronavirus first emerged.

Officials in the city, Wuhan, placed the new tally at 3,869 deaths, an
increase of 1,290, or 50 percent, from the previous figure. The number
of confirmed infections in the city was also revised upward to 50,333,
an increase of 325.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Officials in Wuhan said the revised death toll now included those who
died at home in the early days of the outbreak, as well as deaths that
were not properly reported by hospitals or registered on death
certificates.
