Two new studies using antibody tests to assess how many people have been
infected with the coronavirus have turned up numbers higher than some
experts had expected.

Both studies were performed in
[California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/us/coronavirus-california-liberals.html):
one among residents of Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, and
the other among residents of Los Angeles County. In both cases, the
estimates of the number of people infected in those counties were far
higher than the number of confirmed cases.

The studies, conducted by public health officials and scientists at
Stanford University and the University of Southern California, have
earned the ire of critics who questioned both the recruitment methods
and the analyses.

In the Santa Clara County study, researchers tested 3,330 volunteers for
antibodies indicating exposure to the virus. Roughly 1.5 percent were
positive.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After adjustments intended to account for differences between the sample
and the population of the county as a whole, the researchers [estimated
that the prevalence of antibodies was between 2.5 percent and a bit more
than 4
percent](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1).
The county’s population is 1.9 million.

That means that 48,000 to 81,000 people were infected with the
coronavirus in Santa Clara County by early April, the investigators
concluded.

In Los Angeles County, researchers conducted tests at drive-through
sites and at participants’ homes and estimated that 2.8 percent to 5.6
percent of the county’s adult population carried antibodies to the
coronavirus. There are 10.4 million people in Los Angeles
County.

If accurate, that would mean that 220,000 to 442,000 residents had been
exposed. By comparison, only 8,000 cases had been confirmed in the
county by early April, when the testing was done.

While finding volunteers was not difficult, it’s not clear how
representative they were of the populations at large.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To find participants in the Los Angeles County study, researchers used a
random sample of email addresses and telephone numbers of residents to
invite people to participate in what they said would be a Covid-19
survey.

The scientists set limits on participation, based on factors like
ethnicity and age, in an effort to ensure the sample represented the
county’s population. About 1,100 people signed up to be tested.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The study in Santa Clara County found participants by advertising on
Facebook. Most of the first volunteers were in wealthy ZIP codes, so the
investigators also recruited from poorer areas. As in the Los Angeles
County study, the goal was to get a representative sample of the
population.

“It’s not perfect, but it’s the best science can do,” said Dr. John
Ioannidis, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and an author
of the Santa Clara County report.

Antibody studies in other countries have produced similar figures, he
noted.

If the numbers prove accurate, the coronavirus may be much less deadly
than originally expected, with a fatality rate more closely resembling
that of a seasonal flu strain than a pandemic of profound lethality.

But there are questions about who was tested. Among them: Were people
who had reason to think they had been infected overrepresented among the
volunteers?

“We tried to look into the possibility of bias influencing the results,”
Dr. Ioannidis said. “We asked for symptoms recently and in the last few
months, and were very careful with our adjustments. We did a very
lengthy set of analyses.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That data will be published in a forthcoming appendix, he said. In any
event, bias also can work to lower the numbers if the healthiest people
were the ones inclined to be tested, a real
possibility.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

“Nobody knows the truth — let’s be honest,” Dr. Ioannidis said of the
prevalence figures. “But if I had to guess, I would say it is probably
higher than our estimate.”

Many widely available antibody tests have been found to be inaccurate.
The investigators say they validated the accuracy of the tests they used
beforehand, and argue that the tests could not be so much in error as to
invalidate the conclusions.

For vulnerable people, like those in nursing homes, the virus obviously
is a terrible threat. But the new data suggest most adults will
experience milder to asymptomatic infections.

“This is very consistent with the fact that the virus is very common but
not killing at the rate we thought,” Dr. Ioannidis said.

***\[*[*Like the Science Times page on

**[*Science Times newsletter.*](http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU)*\]***

Little is known about the transmissibility of the virus by asymptomatic
adults, however. That may complicate scientific understanding of the
virus’s spread.

With better estimates of the virus’s prevalence and lethality, it may be
easier to reopen society in a manner supported by data, said Neeraj
Sood, vice dean of research at the University of Southern California
Price School of Public Policy and an author of the Los Angeles County
report.
