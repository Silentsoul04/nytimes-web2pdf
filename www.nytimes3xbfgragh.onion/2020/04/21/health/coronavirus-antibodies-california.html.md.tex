Two preliminary efforts to survey citizens for antibodies to the virus
have produced controversial results.

Two new studies using antibody tests to assess how many people have been
infected with the coronavirus have turned up numbers higher than some
experts had expected.

Both studies were performed in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/us/coronavirus-california-liberals.html}{California}:
one among residents of Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, and
the other among residents of Los Angeles County. In both cases, the
estimates of the number of people infected in those counties were far
higher than the number of confirmed cases.

The studies, conducted by public health officials and scientists at
Stanford University and the University of Southern California, have
earned the ire of critics who questioned both the recruitment methods
and the analyses.

In the Santa Clara County study, researchers tested 3,330 volunteers for
antibodies indicating exposure to the virus. Roughly 1.5 percent were
positive.

After adjustments intended to account for differences between the sample
and the population of the county as a whole, the researchers
\href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1}{estimated
that the prevalence of antibodies was between 2.5 percent and a bit more
than 4 percent}. The county's population is 1.9 million.

That means that 48,000 to 81,000 people were infected with the
coronavirus in Santa Clara County by early April, the investigators
concluded.

In Los Angeles County, researchers conducted tests at drive-through
sites and at participants' homes and estimated that 2.8 percent to 5.6
percent of the county's adult population carried antibodies to the
coronavirus. There are 10.4 million people in Los Angeles County.

If accurate, that would mean that 220,000 to 442,000 residents had been
exposed. By comparison, only 8,000 cases had been confirmed in the
county by early April, when the testing was done.

While finding volunteers was not difficult, it's not clear how
representative they were of the populations at large.

To find participants in the Los Angeles County study, researchers used a
random sample of email addresses and telephone numbers of residents to
invite people to participate in what they said would be a Covid-19
survey.

The scientists set limits on participation, based on factors like
ethnicity and age, in an effort to ensure the sample represented the
county's population. About 1,100 people signed up to be tested.

The study in Santa Clara County found participants by advertising on
Facebook. Most of the first volunteers were in wealthy ZIP codes, so the
investigators also recruited from poorer areas. As in the Los Angeles
County study, the goal was to get a representative sample of the
population.

``It's not perfect, but it's the best science can do,'' said Dr. John
Ioannidis, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and an author
of the Santa Clara County report.

Antibody studies in other countries have produced similar figures, he
noted.

If the numbers prove accurate, the coronavirus may be much less deadly
than originally expected, with a fatality rate more closely resembling
that of a seasonal flu strain than a pandemic of profound lethality.

But there are questions about who was tested. Among them: Were people
who had reason to think they had been infected overrepresented among the
volunteers?

``We tried to look into the possibility of bias influencing the
results,'' Dr. Ioannidis said. ``We asked for symptoms recently and in
the last few months, and were very careful with our adjustments. We did
a very lengthy set of analyses.''

That data will be published in a forthcoming appendix, he said. In any
event, bias also can work to lower the numbers if the healthiest people
were the ones inclined to be tested, a real possibility.

    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according

``Nobody knows the truth --- let's be honest,'' Dr. Ioannidis said of
the prevalence figures. ``But if I had to guess, I would say it is
probably higher than our estimate.''

Many widely available antibody tests have been found to be inaccurate.
The investigators say they validated the accuracy of the tests they used
beforehand, and argue that the tests could not be so much in error as to
invalidate the conclusions.

For vulnerable people, like those in nursing homes, the virus obviously
is a terrible threat. But the new data suggest most adults will
experience milder to asymptomatic infections.

``This is very consistent with the fact that the virus is very common
but not killing at the rate we thought,'' Dr. Ioannidis said.

Little is known about the transmissibility of the virus by asymptomatic
adults, however. That may complicate scientific understanding of the
virus's spread.

With better estimates of the virus's prevalence and lethality, it may be
easier to reopen society in a manner supported by data, said Neeraj
Sood, vice dean of research at the University of Southern California
Price School of Public Policy and an author of the Los Angeles County
report.

``We can model the scenarios,'' he said. ``We should not make decisions
just based on I.C.U. mortality.''
