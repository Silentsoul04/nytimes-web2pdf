Live, from Roger Goodell’s basement, the first round of the N.F.L. draft
offered something of a surprise gift on Thursday night: A chance to
focus on selections over spectacle with a smooth run through the top 32
picks.

Sure, the evening generated plenty of questions to keep sports fans
engaged, despite the [almost universal shutdown of
competition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-sports-leagues-returning-canceled.html)
during [the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus): Is
Utah State quarterback Jordan Love really the successor to Aaron Rodgers
in Green Bay? Do the New England Patriots ever pass on trading down?

But mostly the so-called virtual draft played out as an intimate
occasion, taking the audience into young players’ homes as their futures
took shape.

Here’s a look at how the first round went, pick by pick. The second and
third rounds are scheduled for Friday, beginning at 7 p.m., and the
draft ends with four more rounds on Saturday.

The rebuilding Bengals needed a franchise cornerstone and — hey, look,
it’s [Joe
Burrow](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/joe-burrow-nfl-draft.html)\!

As expected, Cincinnati chose the quarterback Burrow with the No. 1
overall pick, rewarding him for his superlative season at Louisiana
State. It’s the first time since 2003, when it took Carson Palmer, that
Cincinnati took a quarterback to begin the draft.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Burrow, the Heisman Trophy winner, threw for 5,671 yards and set a
Football Bowl Subdivision record with 60 touchdown passes — the final 12
of which came in his last two games, blowouts over Oklahoma and Clemson,
to propel L.S.U. to a national title. Only one other player won the
Heisman and the national championship, and was chosen first over all, in
the same year: Cam Newton, in 2011.

“To jump up to No. 1 overall is just crazy to me but it’s a dream come
true,” Burrow said.

Quarterbacks drafted early often join teams bereft of, or at least
lacking in, offensive talent. In that respect, the Bengals are an
anomaly. Burrow enters a reasonably favorable situation, with A.J.
Green, Tyler Boyd and John Ross at receiver and Joe Mixon at running
back. Preparing for Burrow’s arrival, Cincinnati fortified its defense
in free agency, signing cornerbacks Mackensie Alexander and Trae Waynes,
defensive lineman D.J. Reader and linebacker Josh Bynes.

No matter how well Burrow plays, the Bengals, in all likelihood, won’t
be making the playoffs this season. But the team probably won’t be 2-14
like it was in 2019, and for the first time in a long time, they’ll be
exciting, and interesting, again.

Coach Ron Rivera was hired to restore pride and discipline (and winning
seasons) to a decaying franchise, and for a defensive-minded coach,
buttressing the pass rush with the best defensive end prospect in the
class is a reasonable way to start. Chase Young, who led the F.B.S. last
season with 16½ sacks, joins a reconfigured defensive front — Rivera
switched to a 4-3 from a 3-4 — that will allow him, as well as other
ends Ryan Kerrigan and the 2019 first-round pick Montez Sweat, to
concentrate on doing what they do best: harass the quarterback.

At Ohio State, Young learned from the renowned defensive line coach
Larry Johnson Sr., who also tutored, among others, Nick and Joey Bosa,
Aaron Maybin, and Tamba Hali. Johnson challenged himself to find flaws
in Young’s technique, analyzing film in slow motion, and together they
produced what might be the best over all player in the draft.

As he established himself at Ohio State as the best cornerback in his
draft class, [Jeff Okudah found a role model in Darius
Slay.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/jeff-okudah.html) In
each of the last three seasons, Slay, who was traded to Philadelphia
last month from Detroit, was selected to the Pro Bowl. Okudah, at
6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, will now replace him in Detroit, which had been
rumored to be shopping the pick. Jeff Hafley, Okudah’s position coach at
Ohio State, coached seven years in the N.F.L., and he said Okudah has
exceptional size, speed, acceleration, instincts, inquisitiveness and
competitiveness.

He started one year for the Buckeyes, who deployed him much like the
Jets handled Darrelle Revis in his prime, lining him up alone in
man-to-man coverage

Okudah projects as a marvelous fit with the Lions for a simple reason:
What team wouldn’t want a shutdown cornerback?

General Manager Dave Gettleman swoons over “hog mollies” — his
nomenclature for enormous offensive linemen — and that, no doubt, is a
priority for him [as he builds around quarterback Daniel
Jones](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/sports/football/nfl-draft-giants-jets.html).
In [Andrew
Thomas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/andrew-thomas.html),
the Giants have their hog molly. Thomas did nothing but perform at
Georgia. He won freshman all-American honors after starting all 15 games
at right tackle his first season. He shifted to left tackle his
sophomore year and was named to the all-Southeastern Conference team. He
started 13 games at left tackle and was named a first-team all-American
this season.

[He takes his inspiration from
music](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/andrew-thomas.html),
having grown up playing drums. As with music, where he gained confidence
through thousands of repetitions, Thomas found comfort in the mundane.
The more he practiced, he recognized, the better he would get.

On the precipice of his N.F.L. career, Thomas still draws on his musical
background. “It’s the same thing in football,” he said. “Something may
happen that’s unexpected, and how well you respond can change the end of
the game.”

Instead of competing in the SEC, he had season-ending surgery. Instead
of going No. 1 overall, he was surpassed by Burrow. The focus among
scouts wasn’t about whether he was a good fit for an N.F.L. team’s
offense, but whether he was durable enough to play well again.
Tagovailoa was unable to hold his own pro day because of the coronavirus
pandemic, so teams were unable to watch him throw live. Instead, he
posted video of himself training on social media. Obviously, the
Dolphins are comfortable with his health.

Brown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/derrick-brown.html) —
nicknamed Baby Barack at Auburn. Brown measured 6-foot-5 and 326 pounds
at the scouting combine in February. In college, he devoted himself to
helping others, on campus and in the community, serving on leadership
councils, building homes in the Dominican Republic and working at food
banks. On the field, Brown thwarted triple-teams, mauled quarterbacks
and stuffed running lanes.

Rodney Garner, who coaches Auburn’s defensive line, likened Brown to an
amalgam of two N.F.L. stars he tutored at Georgia. Brown, he said, has
the athleticism of Richard Seymour and the power of Marcus Stroud.
“Coaching Derrick Brown was easy,” Garner said in a recent interview.
“In my 31 years, I’ve coached some really good defensive linemen. It’s
been a blessing. And he’s right there at the top of the list.”

The Panthers are in the midst of an [organizational reboot under owner

and cornerback James Bradberry — certainly need a talent infusion on
defense. That begins with Brown.

The Cardinals’ most obvious deficiency was along the offensive line, but
then again, no team allowed more yards last season than they did, making
overall defense a priority in this draft. Arizona shored up its defense
by selecting [Isaiah
Simmons](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/isaiah-simmons.html),
who can play anywhere and everywhere on that side of the ball.

According to Pro Football Focus, Simmons, listed at 6-foot-4 and 238
pounds, played at least 100 snaps at five positions — slot cornerback,
edge rusher, linebacker and both safety spots — and finished with 16½
tackles for a loss, eight sacks, eight pass deflections and three
interceptions. “In a league that doesn’t have a lot of margin for error
when it comes to roster management, I think you immediately get more
than one person,” Brent Venables, his defensive coordinator at Clemson,
said in a recent interview.

Simmons counterbalances the raft of hybridized offensive players
permeating the N.F.L. He has the build, speed and length to counter
players like San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle and Carolina
Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey, who often cause mismatches.
Modern defenses prioritize pressuring the quarterback and stopping the
pass, and Simmons can do both.

Was it just three seasons ago that the Jaguars, buoyed by a snarling
defense, [reached the A.F.C. championship
game](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/21/sports/afc-championship-patriots-jaguars.html)?

That defense is unrecognizable now, having been disassembled in fits and
spurts, but especially this off-season, when cornerback A.J. Bouye,
defensive end Calais Campbell and defensive tackle Marcell Dareus all
departed.

With edge-rusher Yannick Ngakoue angling for a trade, the Jaguars
focused on that side of the ball.

C.J. Henderson **** has the speed and anticipation to erase receivers
all over the field, and his athleticism is absurd; according to [Bruce
Feldman of The
Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1065937/2019/07/12/bruce-feldmans-freaks-list-2019-college-football-top-athletic-performances/),
Henderson bench presses 380 pounds and squats 545.

Henderson can play multiple techniques, man and off, and over the last
two seasons, he yielded just 20 receptions, on 44 targets, in single
coverage on the boundary, according to Pro Football Focus, making him a
prime candidate to start there as a rookie.

Daniel Jeremiah, NFL Network’s draft honcho, said in a recent conference
call that Henderson has more upside than the consensus top corner, Jeff
Okudah of Ohio State, but he must improve his tackling and consistency
playing the ball downfield.

The Browns used this opportunity to finally fill the left tackle spot
that Joe Thomas vacated when he retired three years ago.

At Alabama, Jedrick Wills Jr. anchored the right side of the offensive
line for two years, allowing only one sack and three-and-a-half
quarterback hurries on 714 snaps last season.

He played in 11 games in his first season, then replaced Matt Womack at
right tackle the following year, when he started all 15 games. His
stature grew last season, when he was voted second-team all-American and
first-team all-SEC while starting all 13 games at right tackle.

In Cleveland, he’ll likely switch to the left side to protect Baker
Mayfield’s blind side. Jack Conklin will probably anchor the right side.

Born to a basketball family — his father coaches at his high school, in
Lexington, Ky., and his mom played at Eastern Kentucky — Wills started
walking at five months old, his mother once said. “He didn’t do a lot of
crawling. He was big and strong and stout, and he just got up one day
and took off.” Guess what? He’s still big and strong and stout.

Like the Giants, the Jets very much need an anchor at offensive tackle
to protect their young quarterback, as well as pass-rush help. The Jets
allowed 52 sacks last season, the fourth-most in the N.F.L.

Mekhi Becton should help. His large frame and consistent play at both
right and left tackle made him a star at Louisville. He started 10 games
at right tackle as a junior, 12 more as a sophomore, including 10 of
them at left tackle. His junior season, he started 11 games at left
tackle and was named first-team all-ACC. The Jets appear unconcerned
about a report by [Ian Rapoport of NFL
Network](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1251315257097596928) who
said Becton’s drug test at the combine was flagged, though it isn’t
clear what rule he might have violated.

The son of a transportation supervisor and a caterer (“That’s why I’m so
big,” he said at the scouting combine), Becton ran the fastest 40-yard
dash (5.1) for a player his size since 2006. In ninth grade, he shot up
five inches, to 6-foot-5, and when his doctor told his mother, Semone,
that his growth plate was still open — he wasn’t done growing yet — she
was stunned. The hardest part, she told the Louisville Courier-Journal,
was buying him clothes: “Within a couple months, they’re high-waters.
You buy these nice tennis shoes, then he skips a size and you have to
pass them on to someone else.”

He does want to lose about 10-15 pounds, to play around 350-355, in the
N.F.L., where his nimble feet and unadulterated power would allow him to
play either tackle position. Also, he can dunk.

For the [Raiders, which open a new stadium in their new home of Las
Vegas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/13/sports/football/oakland-raiders-las-vegas-stadium.html)
this season, the priority has to be upgrading the receiving talent
around quarterback Derek Carr. Henry Ruggs III from Alabama fits the
bill. Ruggs ran a 4.27, 40-yard dash at combine, the fastest of any
position — and the third-fastest ever at the event since electronic
timing was introduced in 1999.

At Alabama, he was more of a deep threat, averaging 17.5 yards a
reception, as the speedy complement to Jerry Jeudy. Ruggs III was also a
kick returner his freshman and junior years.

His mom, Nataki, ran track in Kansas, and she has said that she ran a
4.23 during a workout once.

“If you ask me, she never ran that time,” Ruggs said at the combine. “I
knew she was pretty fast. She used to run in the neighborhood, run
against guys all the time and beat them. And we used to race when I was
young — but I was young. I was small, didn’t have long legs, didn’t
really know too much about running. Her track background helped her out
when we were racing to the car at the grocery store, stuff like that.
But ultimately, she’ll tell you that she’s not faster than me. Maybe in
her prime, she felt like it. But … no.”

Every move the Buccaneers make revolves around maximizing their window
with a quarterback who turns 43 in August. Tampa Bay traded up one spot,
taking the San Francisco 49ers’ pick, so they could draft an offensive
lineman to[help protect Tom
Brady.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/sports/football/tom-brady-signed-tampa-bay.html)

Tristan Wirfs should help. His diverse athletic background — his past in
wrestling, in particular — informed his approach to playing offensive
tackle. An absolute mauler in the run game and a reliable pass-blocker,
Wirfs played mostly right tackle at Iowa and ceded only 40 quarterback
pressures on 1,138 pass-blocking snaps at Iowa, according to Pro
Football Focus.

“In wrestling, you need footwork, you need balance, awareness, body
control — all that translates to offensive line,” Wirfs said in a recent
interview. “You don’t get into big scrambles like you do in wrestling on
the offensive line, but you still can get out of sorts and get your
center of gravity off-kilter. To find that center of gravity and
hopefully finish a block, it’s just like putting a guy on his back in
wrestling.”

In a draft class loaded with premier offensive tackles, and playing a
position reserved for the most powerful of dudes, Wirfs manages to stand
out. He won three consecutive state titles in the discus, two in the
shot put and one in wrestling, in the 285-pound weight class, in
addition to playing football.

Wirfs’s mother, Sarah, raised him and his sister, Kaylia, rushing to
their athletic pursuits after her shift at Target, where she has worked
for 28 years (naturally, his favorite job of his mother’s was in the
bakery, since she would bring home snacks). Just before the draft began,
he invited Sarah to walk a makeshift red carpet in front of their home,
to acknowledge her support.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The San Francisco 49ers have two first-round selections, but none in
Rounds 2 through 4. That means general manager John Lynch will want to
quickly fill their biggest holes, including shoring up their interior
defensive line after trading DeForest Buckner to the Indianapolis Colts
for the 13th pick in this year’s draft, which they swapped with Tampa
Bay.

The 49ers took Javon Kinlaw from South Carolina, an outstanding pass
rusher with long arms, to replace Buckner.

At the scouting combine, Kinlaw called himself “a boring person,” but he
has neither lived a boring life, nor, as a pocket-collapsing,
backfield-prowling defensive tackle, is he a boring player. As his
mother labored to find contracting work throughout his childhood, Kinlaw
and his two brothers bounced around dangerous areas of Washington, D.C.
looking for shelter. Kinlaw regularly switched schools and in the ninth
grade moved to South Carolina to live with his father, George. Kinlaw
has said that felt so unsafe with George sometimes that he would look
for somewhere else to stay.

Eventually, at Goose Creek High School, he befriended Timothy Davis,
whose parents, Calvin and Monica, took him in. Kinlaw identified the
turning point in his life as making it to college, first to junior
college in Mississippi, then to South Carolina, where he became a
first-team all-American. “Just having three meals,” Kinlaw said at the
combine. “I always tell people I didn’t go to junior college for
football, really. I just went because I had somewhere to sleep. I had
free food. That’s really why I went. I didn’t go with the expectation
that, ‘Man, I’m going to go to the SEC, I’m going to go to the league. I
went because I had somewhere to sleep.’’’

Jerry Jeudy, a polished route-runner who can line up anywhere in a

same school taken in the first round since 1967.

And it wasn’t the traditional handshake and hug that have come to mark
N.F.L. draft picks, but Jeudy convinced Roger Goodell to perform the
Toosie Slide dance with him on social media.

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

As a sophomore, Jeudy won the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the best college
wide receiver in the country. He caught 68 passes for 1,315 yards and 14
touchdowns that year. His numbers dipped a bit as a junior, when he
caught 77 passes for 1,163 yards and 10 touchdowns, and was named to the
all-SEC team for the second time.

Jeudy grew up in South Florida playing with Lamar Jackson, who, he said,
taught him how to juke. His 7-year-old sister, Aaliyah — who lived her
whole life with breathing tubes, according to reports — died while he
played in a state playoff game as a high school senior in 2016 and he
has since dedicated his career to her memory.

Before the draft, Jeudy showed up to a news conference at the combine in
February wearing a Jewish star medallion. Asked about it, he said, “My
last name, Jeudy, people sometimes call me Jeu (Jew?), like one Jew. So
I got a Jewish star. I’m not Jewish though.” Thanks for clarifying,
Jerry.

The priority for the Atlanta Falcons is improving the defense —
everywhere. No, really. Everywhere. They were 23rd in defense last
season, allowing 24.9 points per game, and the team plays in a division
with Drew Brees and the Saints as well as Tom Brady and the Buccaneers,
two teams that promise to score a lot of points this coming season.

To fend off those gunslingers, the Falcons took A.J. Terrell, a
cornerback from Clemson. Terrell’s struggles toward the end of 2019 —
Ja’Marr Chase of Louisiana State disassembled him during the national
championship game — offset a strong career at Clemson, where he
intercepted six passes and defended 11 more during his three seasons in
the Tigers’ secondary.

His tackles, though, declined last season, a comedown from a superb
second year. No doubt, Dan Quinn, a defensive minded head coach, will
work on that.

Dallas went for offense, grabbing CeeDee Lamb (6-foot-2, 198 pounds),
who averaged 21.4 yards on his 62 receptions and 14 touchdowns last
season at Oklahoma, to a receiving corps that already has Amari Cooper
and Michael Gallup.

[Jones had

the draft that he was looking forward to selecting in quarantine, where
no one would be able to talk him out of his pick. In typically flashy
Jonesian fashion, the Cowboys team owner appeared onscreen to be holed

In addition to putting up nearly 3,300 receiving yards and 32 touchdown
receptions in three college seasons, he was also the main punt returner
for the Sooners. Lamb lived in New Orleans — “being a kid from
Louisiana, that’s all we knew was Reggie Bush” — until Hurricane Katrina
forced his family to move to Houston. Asked at the combine where his
work ethic comes from, he said, “It’s kind of being in a dark place at a
young age and not having everything that I wanted growing up. It pushes
me a lot to get a lot of things that I want now, and it all comes with
work. So why not work for what I want? I’d rather work than it just be
given to me.”

Asked what distinguished him from other defensive linemen, Chaisson
said:“It’s obvious. I’m going to be honest. I’m actually the most
valuable player in the draft, when it comes to it. We all know that.
When you hire someone do you want to hire someone who speaks one
language or do you want to hire someone that speaks three languages? I
speak three languages. I do pass rush. I can drop in coverage and cover
anybody you want me to cover. I can play the run. And no offensive
lineman has ever just moved me off the ball, or bullied me. So I feel
like that’s what makes me more dimensional. And a more valuable player
than anybody else in the draft.”

last season. Unlike in 2019, the team’s priority is surrounding Wentz
with receiving talent and improving their team speed. Doing anything
else with this pick would have been an extraordinarily unpopular
decision in Philadelphia, and the Eagles mollified their fans by taking
Jalen Reagor (5-foot-11, 206 pounds) of Texas Christian, an athletic

Tom Brady at quarterback — do they draft his replacement? A defensive
lineman? A linebacker? — dissipated when they engaged in their favorite
pastime, trading down to hoard more picks. The Chargers, seeking to
bolster their defense, happily obliged, offering a second-rounder (37th
overall) and a third-round selection (71st over all).

Los Angeles traded up to select Kenneth Murray, a sideline-to-sideline
force at Oklahoma, where he had 36½ tackles for loss over his three
seasons. And Murray (6-foot-2, 241 pounds) has a background as
impressive as his football career. The son of a retired police officer,
Dianna, and a pastor, Kenneth Sr., Murray has one biological sibling, a
sister, and three adopted siblings, all of whom have a genetic disorder

to maximize his ability. “Every time I come home, they can’t talk but
they know who I am and they know my voice, they know when I touch them,”
Murray said.

Growing up, he would volunteer at a community center for underprivileged
children, and there he learned C.P.R., training that proved critical
last July. He and his girlfriend were returning from church in Norman,
Okla., when they noticed a woman stricken on the ground at an

The position has been a bit of a hole for the team after longtime center
Max Unger retired before the 2019 season.

Ruiz was the top center prospect in the country out of high school. At
Michigan, he started at right guard as a freshman, and steadily improved
the next two seasons. Ruiz is considered athletic, aggressive and quick,

Aiyuk a junior college transfer excels in grabbing yardage after the

Miami traded its third pick of the first round to the Green Bay Packers,
who used it to choose [Jordan
Love](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/jordan-love.html), a
quarterback from Utah State. This raises instant questions about whether
he is being brought in to succeed Aaron Rodgers — now 36 — just as
Rodgers arrived as Brett Favre’s replacement when he was 35.

Given that the [Packers made it to the N.F.C. championship
game](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/packers-49ers) last
year, the team could have tried to find a few missing pieces to help
Rodgers get back to the Super Bowl.

Instead, they put down a marker on the post-Rodgers era, whenever that
begins. Despite throwing the most interceptions (17) in Division I in
2019, Love is the most tantalizing prospect [since Patrick
Mahomes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/30/sports/football/Chiefs-patrick-mahomes.html),
who, despite obvious bountiful physical ability, had to quell the
perception that playing in an [Air
Raid](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/13/sports/air-raid-kliff-kingsbury-kyler-murray.html)
offense at Texas Tech would hinder him in the N.F.L. ([Spoiler alert: It
hasn’t](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/03/sports/football/patrick-mahomes-comeback-super-bowl.html).)

From a strictly stylistic standpoint, Love resembles Mahomes. Love’s arm
strength, coupled with a flair for extending plays, passing on the run
and throwing from odd angles, produced a [string of absurd
highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ki92VlkEic). His film —
from last season, especially — also contains instances of lapsed
mechanics, forced throws and shaky field vision. Like another former
Mountain West quarterback, Josh Allen, whom the Buffalo Bills drafted
No. 7 over all two years ago, Love excelled as a sophomore, when he was
surrounded by strong personnel, then backslid when the quality around
him diminished. Besides playing with nine new offensive starters last
season, Love also acclimated to a new coaching staff and offense.

Jim Nagy, the 18-year N.F.L. scout who is now the executive director of
the Senior Bowl, said Love has the potential to develop into the best
quarterback taken this year but that, ideally, he will sit for a season.
“In hindsight, we’re all saying, ‘How the heck did Patrick Mahomes last
to 12?’” Nagy said, referencing the pick Kansas City used to draft him.
“If Jordan gets to the right situation and everything clicks for him,
we’re going to be sitting here in three or four years saying, ‘How did
players X, Y and Z get drafted ahead of Jordan Love?’”

The Baltimore Ravens lost Marshal Yanda, perhaps the best guard in the
league, to retirement, creating need on the interior of their offensive
line. They will have to handle that later as they instead focused on
linebacker to alleviate the stress on a defense that labored to generate
pressure without a blitzing edge-rusher last season.

Patrick Queen from L.S.U. should help their needs. Quick and
instinctive, Queen did not start at L.S.U. until last season, when he
recorded 85 tackles — 12 for loss — and an interception, of Tua
Tagovailoa, in the [46-41 victory over
Alabama](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/09/sports/ncaafootball/lsu-alabama-tigers-tide.html)
that powered the Tigers’ stampede to the national championship. In
recent years, L.S.U. has produced a slew of great linebackers, from Kwon
Alexander to Deion Jones to Devin White. Queen is poised to be the next
in that lineage.

From an early age, Queen was so athletically proficient — he dribbled
basketballs with both hands, blasted home runs, and hurt others while
playing tackle football — that his parents, Mary Sue and Dwayne, who
played cornerback at Nicholls State, had to show his birth certificate
to prove his age. He remains a marvel.

The Tennessee Titans are picking late this year happily, having made it
to the [A.F.C. championship
game](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/titans-chiefs-01-19).
They got that far because of a powerful [running game powered by Derrick
Henry.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/16/sports/derrick-henry-titans-playoffs.html)
With the 29th pick, the Titans have doubled down on the running game.

The team lost right tackle Jack Conklin in free agency, and they’ve
replaced him with Isaiah Wilson, a tackle from Georgia.

Wilson started slow at Georgia but his size (6-foot-6, 350 pounds) and
athleticism paid dividends, as he started all 14 games at right tackle
and earned freshman all-American honors. An ankle injury limited him to
11 games the following year, but still was named to the second-team
Associated Press All-American. His play was at times uneven,
particularly in pass protection, but he excelled in man-to-man blocks.
He may need to improve his footwork to keep up in zone-blocking schemes.

Wilson loves “SpongeBob SquarePants.”

Miami traded its 26th pick to the Packers, who offered the 30th pick in
return. The Dolphins took a top shelf quarterback (Tua Tagovailoa) and
one of the best offensive tackles available (Austin Jackson) with its
first two picks.

So it made sense that the team focused on adding to the defense with its
third first-round pick. In Noah Igbinoghene, a cornerback from Auburn,
gives Miami a solid defensive backfield.

A coveted recruit at receiver, Igbinoghene moved to cornerback after his
freshman year of college. He started his final two seasons, defending 19
passes and recording one interception. He started all 13 games (42
tackles, one for loss, seven pass break-ups) last year. He’s also a good
kick returner, returning one of nine kickoff returns for a touchdown.

Noah Igbinoghene grew up in an athletic household — his mother, Faith,
won a bronze medal for Nigeria in the 400-meter relay at the 1992
Barcelona Olympics, and his father, Festus, competed for Nigeria in
triple jump at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Igbinoghene competed in both
football and track and field at Auburn.

Jeff Gladney probably won’t wow many draft pundits. But for a Vikings
team with a depleted defensive backfield, having lost three cornerbacks,
he’ll make any receiver he faces compete for the ball. [According to
Dane Brugler of The
Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1648084/2020/03/02/draft-expert-dane-brugler-breaks-down-cowboys-best-case-scenario-sleepers/),
Gladney defended more passes (43) than started games (42) during his
stellar career at T.C.U. Playing in the Big 12, where defense is often
just a rumor, Gladney hounded some of the conference’s best receivers;
Denzel Mims of Baylor called him the toughest cornerback he faced all
season.

Even if the 5-foot-10 Gladney doesn’t stick as a boundary corner because
of his size, his coverage skills, tenacity and feistiness make him an
ideal candidate to flourish in the slot.

The Kansas City Chiefs have retained much of its [Super Bowl
championship
team](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/03/sports/football/chiefs-super-bowl-champions.html).
They re-signed cornerback Bashaud Breeland but lost Kendall Fuller in
free agency to Washington, making cornerback a rare area of need.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Instead, they opted to bolster their sterling offense by picking running
back Clyde Edwards-Helaire from Louisiana State. The Chiefs’ leading
rusher, Damien Williams, only rushed for 498 yards. But like most backs
in Andy Reid’s offense, Edwards-Helaire will be asked to catch passes,
too.

A big part of L.S.U.’s undefeated championship season, Edwards-Helaire
rushed for 1,415 yards and 16 touchdowns, starting all but one of the
teams’ games. He is also a versatile receiver, with 55 receptions last
season, and a capable kick returner, helping him with all-SEC honors.
