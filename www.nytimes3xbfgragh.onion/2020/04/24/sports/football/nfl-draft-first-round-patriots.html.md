# 2020 N.F.L. Draft: What We Learned

</div>

Green Bay delivered the shock of the night drafting Jordan Love as a
potential successor to Aaron Rodgers, Miami’s rebuild is coming to
fruition and New England is still New England.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The 85th N.F.L. draft might have lacked the glitz of the Las Vegas Strip
and bro-hugs with Roger Goodell, but the first virtual draft in league
history still had its football pyrotechnics. There were a few chip
shots, like quarterback [Joe
Burrow](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/joe-burrow-nfl-draft.html)
getting picked first overall by the Cincinnati Bengals. But there were
also plenty of other surprises and intrigue — not all of it generated by
the Raiders.

Here’s what we learned:

## Aaron Rodgers now knows how Brett Favre felt.

Favre, umm, did not take it kindly when Green Bay drafted Rodgers with
the 24th pick in 2005. The Packers traded up to select [Jordan
Love](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/jordan-love.html) at
No. 26, not because they envision him succeeding Rodgers this season, or
even in 2021. The job still belongs to Rodgers, 36, who is under
contract through 2023. But Green Bay, at a prime draft spot, did not
ignore other areas of need — wide receiver, especially — so that Love
can back up Rodgers indefinitely.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is an ideal situation for Love to learn and listen, provided Rodgers
— and Green Bay fans — treat Love better than Favre did him as a
rookie. [Rodgers spent three years backing up
Favre](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/12/03/sports/football/the-education-of-the-packers-aaron-rodgers.html)
before taking over at
[quarterback](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/sports/football/nfl-quarterback-controversies.html),
and now Love might do the same to Rodgers.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Perhaps Rodgers can fend off Love, as Tom Brady did in New England with
Jimmy Garoppolo, forcing Green Bay to deal the Utah State quarterback
for other assets. The Packers did not improve their 2020 team on
Thursday night, and Rodgers — when not wondering why the team hasn’t
picked an offensive skill player in the first round since, well, him —
surely could question how he now fits into the Packers’ long-term plans.

## The Dolphins tanking risk paid off.

The Dolphins, despite razing the roster, [won a few games last
season](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/19/sports/football/brian-flores-dolphins.html)
— and still drafted the quarterback, [Tua
Tagovailoa,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/tua-tagovailoa.html)
it was reportedly tanking for. That’s some good karma right there.

Miami’s grand plan started taking shape during free agency, when it
lured cornerback Byron Jones, linebackers Kyle Van Noy and Elandon
Roberts and the defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah. But it did not truly come
to fruition until Thursday night, when the team could expend some of the
draft capital it had compiled.

quarterback Tua Tagovailoa’s draft status was dogged by concerns about
his recovery from a dislocated hip. The Miami Dolphins selected him with
the No. 5 pick in the draft
Thursday.</span><span class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>NFL,

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Miami took Tagovailoa at No. 5 and their future left tackle, [Austin
Jackson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/austin-jackson.html)
of Southern California, at No. 18 before trading down and adding an
athletic corner, Noah Igbinoghene of Auburn, at No. 30. And they’re not
done: The Dolphins have three picks Friday, when the second and third
rounds are held, and nine (\!) on Saturday, for rounds 4 through 7.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Jackson will bolster an offensive line that allowed 58 sacks last
season, and Igbinoghene slides into the most improved secondary in the
A.F.C. East. But Tagovailoa is the centerpiece, and for a team that’s
been searching for a quarterback since Dan Marino retired, he represents
an altogether fitting choice.

By shedding talent last off-season, the Dolphins chose an unpopular
rebuilding path. They were chided and lampooned. It was a risk because
weird things happen in the N.F.L. and even bad teams win sometimes. In
the end, that strategy led them to Tagovailoa, who, because of health
and durability concerns, is hardly a safe pick. But the Dolphins were
rewarded for their aggressiveness once, and now they hope they will be
again.

## The Patriots played to type.

The Tom Brady era may be over in New England, but [don’t expect coach
Bill Belichick to
change](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/sports/football/patriots-nfl-draft-bill-belichick.html).
The Patriots had the 23rd pick in the first round, but rather than use
the spot to upgrade at, say, quarterback, it traded the pick to the Los
Angeles Chargers and received a second-round pick (37th overall) and a
third-round pick (71st overall) in return.

There’s a method to Belichick’s trades. The Patriots had traded a
second-round pick last season to get wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, and
have not made a first-round pick in four of the past eight years. Now
they have [13 picks over the next two
days](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/04/23/patriots-trade-out-of-first-round-get-second-and-third-round-picks-from-chargers/)
of the draft.

But as my colleague, Bill Pennington, noted, the Patriots will probably
have to trade a top player to create salary cap space. They currently
have about $1 million in cap space, which isn’t enough to sign even
their incoming draft class. But packaging, for example, the All-Pro
guard Joe Thuney with a valuable 2021 pick would free up $15 million in
cap space.

## The SEC remained dominant.

The ultimate currency in any debate about the strongest college
conference is how many players end up in the N.F.L. This year, the
Southeastern Conference was undeniably the winner, with 15 of its
players selected with the first 32 picks of the draft. Nine of those
picks came from L.S.U., the national champions, and Alabama. Auburn and
Georgia each had two players selected. Three Ohio State players were
chosen Thursday, including the second ([Chase
Young](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/chase-young.html)) and
third ([Jeff
Okudah](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/jeff-okudah.html))
picks over all.
