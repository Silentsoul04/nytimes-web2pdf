President Trump’s self-assessment has been consistent.

“I’m, like, a very smart person,” he assured voters in 2016.

“A very stable genius,” he ruled two years later.

“I’m not a doctor,” he allowed on Thursday, pointing to his skull inside
the White House briefing room, “but I’m, like, a person that has a good
you-know-what.”

Mr. Trump’s performance that evening, when he [suggested that injections
of
disinfectants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html)
into the human body could help combat the coronavirus, did not sound
like the work of a doctor, a genius, or a person with a good
you-know-what.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even by the turbulent standards of this president, his musings on virus
remedies have landed with uncommon force, drawing widespread
condemnation as dangerous to the health of Americans and inspiring a
near-universal alarm that many of his past remarks — whether offensive
or fear-mongering or simply untrue — did
not.

## 260,000 Words, Full of Self-Praise, From Trump on the Virus

Three journalists from The New York Times reviewed more than 260,000
words spoken by President Trump during the pandemic. Here’s what we
learned.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump’s typical name-calling can be recast to receptive audiences as
mere “counterpunching.” His impeachment was explained away as the
dastardly opus of overreaching Democrats. It is more difficult to insist
that the man floating disinfectant injection knows what he’s doing.

The reaction has so rattled the president’s allies and advisers that he
was compelled over the weekend to [remove himself from the pandemic
briefings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/25/us/coronavirus-news.html)
entirely, at least temporarily accepting two fates he loathes: giving in
to advice (from Republicans who said the appearances [did far more harm
than
good](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/25/us/politics/trump-election-briefings.html)
to his political standing) and surrendering the mass viewership he
relishes.

Some at the White House have expressed frustration that the issue has
lingered. “It bothers me that this is still in the news cycle,” Dr.
Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, told CNN on Sunday,
adding, “I worry that we don’t get the information to the American
people that they need, when we continue to bring up something that was
from Thursday night.”

Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican who has been willing to speak
skeptically about Mr. Trump’s virus leadership, said on ABC’s “This
Week” on Sunday that it “does send a wrong message” when
misinformation spreads from a public official or “you just say something
that pops in your head.” Asked to explain the president’s words, Mr.
Hogan said, “You know, I can’t really explain it.”

former Vice President Dan Quayle and [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),
now the presumptive Democratic nominee, among many others. But Mr.
Trump’s stark pronouncement — on live television, amid a grave public
health crisis, and leaving little room for interpretation — was at once
in a class of its own and wholly consistent with a reputation for
carelessness in speech.

Still, for weeks, the president’s political team has been strikingly
explicit about its intended messaging against Mr. Biden: presenting him
as a doddering 77-year-old not up to the rigors of the office — and
setting off on the kind of whisper campaign that does not bother with
whispers.

A Trump campaign Twitter account on Saturday celebrated the anniversary
of Mr. Biden’s 2020 bid by highlighting all that he had “forgotten” as a
candidate, with corresponding video clips of momentary flubs and verbal
stumbles: “Joe Biden forgot the name of the coronavirus.” “Joe Biden
forgot the G7 was not the G8.” “Joe Biden forgot Super Tuesday was on a
Tuesday.”

On Sunday, the Trump campaign made clear that the disinfectant affair
would not disrupt its plans. “Joe Biden is often lost,” said Tim
Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, “losing his train of thought
during friendly interviews, even when he relies on written notes in
front of him.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

T.J. Ducklo, a Biden spokesman, called this approach “a distraction
tactic — as if anything could erase the memory of the president
suggesting people drink disinfectant on national television.”

Carlos Curbelo, a Republican former Florida congressman who clashed at
times with Mr. Trump and did not vote for him, said the president’s
comments on disinfectants were likely to resonate precisely because he
was running a race premised largely on Mr. Biden’s mental capacity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Given Joe Biden’s gaffes and mistakes, I think the Trump campaign had a
strong narrative there,” he said. “At the very least, that advantage was
completely erased.”

Mr. Curbelo said a friend had suggested recently that Mr. Trump’s toxic
virus idea was “the craziest thing he ever said.”

“I said, ‘I don’t know,’” Mr. Curbelo recalled. “‘Maybe. I’d have to
look back and check.’”

This history, of course, is the argument for Democratic caution. The
list of episodes that were supposed to end Mr. Trump — the “Access
Hollywood” tape, the “very fine people” on both sides of a white
supremacist rally, insulting John McCain’s service as a prisoner of war
— is longer than most voters’ memories.

The president can register as more
[time-bending](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/29/us/politics/trump-news-overload.html)
than Teflon. Plenty sticks to him; it just tends to be buried quickly
enough by the next stack of outrages, limiting the exposure of any
single one.

But if most Trump admirers have long since made up their minds about
him, recent polling on his handling of the crisis does suggest some
measure of electoral risk. Governors and public health officials like
Dr. Anthony Fauci are viewed as far more trustworthy on the pandemic,
according to
surveys.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

For Mr. Trump, such mockery tends to singe. Since long before his 2016
campaign, few subjects have been as meaningful to him as appraisals of
his intellect.

It is a source of perpetual obsession and manifest insecurity, former
aides say, so much so that Mr. Trump has felt the need to allude to his
brainpower regularly: tales of his academic credentials at the
University of Pennsylvania; his “natural ability” in complicated
disciplines; his connection to a “super genius” uncle, [an
engineer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1985/02/26/us/john-trump-dies-engineer-was-78.html)
who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

When Rex Tillerson, the president’s first secretary of state, was
[reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/tillerson-s-fury-trump-required-intervention-pence-n806451)
to have called Mr. Trump a “moron” in private — one of several former
senior administration officials said to have rendered equivalent
verdicts — Mr. Trump challenged him to “compare I.Q. tests.” A favorite
Trump insult on Twitter, [reserved for Mr.
Biden](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1107631297076305920)
among others, is “low I.Q. individual.”

“He doesn’t want to feel like anybody is better than he is,” said
Barbara A. Res, a former executive vice president of the Trump
Organization, who recalled Mr. Trump bragging about his college grades.
“He can’t deal with that. I can see it now with the doctors, and
that’s why he dismisses them. He used to be intimidated by lawyers.
Anyone who knows more than he does makes him feel less than he is.”

Steve Schmidt, a former Republican strategist and prominent Trump
critic, said the president’s meditation on disinfectants stood apart
from a trope that Mr. Schmidt came to recognize as an adviser to
conservatives like Mr. Bush: “that the conservative candidate in the
race was also always portrayed as the dumb candidate.”

“But a caricature is distinct from a narrative,” Mr. Schmidt said. And
Mr. Trump’s reckless medical fare, he reasoned, had given adversaries a
narrative by confirming a caricature.

The president’s own [attempts at damage
control](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html)
have been scattershot. First, his new press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany,
accused the news media of taking Mr. Trump out of context. Shortly
afterward, he undercut her case by saying his comments had in fact been
a sarcastic prank on reporters, an explanation even some supporters
found implausible.

He left his Friday briefing on the coronavirus without taking questions.
By Saturday, when Mr. Trump tweeted that the events were “[not worth the
time &
effort](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/25/us/coronavirus-news.html),”
his opponents conceded this much:

The president had probably done something smart.
