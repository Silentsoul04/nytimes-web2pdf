\section{C.D.C. Adds New Symptoms to Its List of Possible Covid-19
Signs}\label{cdc-adds-new-symptoms-to-its-list-of-possible-covid-19-signs}}

Chills, muscle pain, sore throat and headache are among the ailments now
considered potential indicators of the disease.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/politics/trump-cdc.html}{Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention} has expanded its list of possible
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/05/well/covid-19-symptoms.html}{symptoms
of the coronavirus}, a step that reflects the broad variation and
unpredictability in the way the illness can affect individual patients.

Echoing the observations of doctors treating thousands of patients in
the pandemic, the federal health agency changed its website to cite the
following
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html}{symptoms}
as possible indicators of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/politics/trump-cdc.html}{Covid-19},
the infection caused by the coronavirus:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  chills
\item
  repeated shaking with chills
\item
  muscle pain
\item
  headache
\item
  sore throat
\item
  and, new loss of taste or smell.
\end{itemize}

Previously it had listed just three
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html}{symptoms}:
fever, cough and shortness of breath.

The C.D.C. added the six symptoms earlier this month after
\href{https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/interim-20-id-01_covid-19.pdf}{new
recommendations} were issued by an organization of public health
epidemiologists that is responsible for defining which infectious
diseases are tracked and reported to the agency. The organization, the
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists or C.S.T.E.,
recommended that Covid-19 be considered a nationally reportable illness
and gave guidelines about how cases should be defined and identified.

The group's recommendations say that cases should be reported if there
are positive lab tests, but also if there are clinical symptoms that
meet one of several thresholds. One category involves people who have
cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Another involves
people with two of the following symptoms: fever, chills, shivers,
muscle pain, headache, sore throat or new dysfunction of taste and
smell. Cases of people in both categories should be reported as likely
Covid-19 only if there is no other more plausible diagnosis, the
recommendations say.

While people who become seriously ill from coronavirus infection
primarily have acute respiratory distress, other symptoms that accompany
the disease can vary widely, doctors and researchers have reported.

It has turned out, for example, that many people with Covid-19 don't
have fevers or that their fevers wax and wane and are sometimes
accompanied by chills.

Shortness of breath can emerge at the same time as other symptoms or it
can crop up suddenly a week or even 10 days after a person has been
experiencing more manageable symptoms like cough and aches.

Some people report a notable loss of smell and taste, an effect that can
also occur with other respiratory infections.

The revised C.D.C. list differs somewhat from the symptoms described by
the
\href{https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses}{World
Health Organization} on its website. The W.H.O. says the most common
symptoms are fever, dry cough and tiredness. ``Some patients may have
aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea,'' the W.H.O.
says. ``These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.''

Both agencies recommend that people seek emergency medical attention if
they have trouble breathing or persistent pain or pressure in the chest.
The C.D.C. also says that immediate medical attention should be sought
if people experience sudden confusion, cannot be aroused or if their
lips or face turn a bluish color.
