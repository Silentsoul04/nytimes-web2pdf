“I’m trying not to get too close to people,” said Birgit Lilja, 82,
explaining that she had left her house to pick up a new identity card in
person. “But I trust them to be careful with me.”

Trust is high in
[Sweden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-pariah-scandinavia.html)
— in government, institutions and fellow Swedes. When the government
defied conventional wisdom and refused to order a wholesale lockdown to
“flatten the curve” of the coronavirus epidemic, public health
officials pointed to trust as a central justification.

Sweden’s death rate of 22 per 100,000 people is the same as that of
Ireland, which has [earned
accolades](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/11/world/europe/ireland-leo-varadkar-coronavirus.html)
for its handling of the pandemic, and far better than in Britain or
France.

Yet, on this warm spring day, at least, there was little evidence that
people were observing the protocols — adding further mystery to Sweden’s
apparent success in handling the scourge without an economically
devastating lockdown.

All around Ms. Lilja along Skanegatan Street in the Sodermalm
neighborhood of Stockholm, younger Swedes thronged bars, restaurants and
a crowded park last week, drinking in the sun.

They laughed and basked in freedoms considered normal in most parts of
the world not long ago, before coronavirus lockdowns, quarantines and
mass restrictions upended social norms. As other nations in Europe begin
to consider reopening their economies, Sweden’s experience would seem to
argue for less caution, not
more.

Skanegatan Street.

The restaurant consultant praised the freedoms he had in Sweden compared

While other countries were slamming on the brakes, Sweden kept its
borders open, allowed restaurants and bars to keep serving, left
preschools and grade schools in session and placed no limits on public
transport or outings in local parks. Hairdressers, yoga studios, gyms
and even some cinemas have remained open.

Gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. Museums have closed and
sporting events have been canceled. At the end of March, the authorities
banned visits to nursing homes.

That’s roughly it. There are almost no fines, and police officers can
only ask people to oblige. Pedestrians wearing masks are generally
stared at as if they have just landed from Mars.

On Sunday, five restaurants were closed down for failing to observe
social distancing requirements. They were not fined, however, and will
be permitted to reopen after passing an inspection, Per Follin, the
regional medical officer with the Department of Communicable Disease
Control and Prevention, said.

Throughout the crisis Sweden has had enough intensive care units to deal
with Covid-19 patients, the minister of health and social affairs, Lena
Hallengren, said in an interview, referring to the disease caused by the
virus. “We have 250 empty beds right now.”

[A compilation of mortality figures by The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html)
found that many countries were undercounting Covid-19 deaths by the
thousands, while Sweden reported just 400 more deaths than expected
between March 9 and April 19.

This is not to say that Sweden has escaped Covid-19’s deadly
consequences entirely.

The [Swedish Public Health
Authority](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/)
has admitted that the country’s seniors have been hit hard, with the
virus spreading through 75 percent of the 101 care homes in Stockholm.
Employees of the homes complain of shortages of personal protective
equipment.

The authority announced last week that more than 26 percent of the 2
million inhabitants of Stockholm will have been infected by May 1. But
even that figure was presented as something of a win: a number of
infections that might limit future outbreaks, reached without suffering
an inordinate number of deaths.

The freer approach has not fully insulated Sweden’s economy, mainly
because the country is dependent on exports, the minister of finance,
Magdalena Andersson, said. She said the economy was likely to shrink by
7 percent this year, “but of course hairdressers, restaurants and hotels
are less affected compared to other countries.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From the first signs of the pandemic, the Swedish Public Health
Authority decided that a lockdown would be pointless. “Once you get into
a lockdown, it’s difficult to get out of it,” the country’s state
epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said. “How do you reopen? When?”

Scientists like Mr. Tegnell, who has become something of a celebrity in
Sweden, and not politicians have driven the debate over the coronavirus
response.

Political leaders rarely attend news conferences about the virus, and
the Swedish Constitution prevents the government from meddling in the
affairs of independent administrative authorities, such as the Public
Health Authority.

While there was some early talk in Sweden of achieving “herd immunity,”
which would mean infecting at least 60 percent of the population, Mr.
Tegnell denies that was ever the government’s
policy.

“Basically we are trying to do the same thing that most countries are
doing — slow down the spread as much as possible,” he said. “It’s just
that we use slightly different tools than many other countries.”

When responses are assessed after the crisis, Mr. Tegnell acknowledges,
Sweden will have to face its broad failing with people over the age of
70, who have accounted for a staggering 86 percent of the country’s
2,194 fatalities to date.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That percentage is roughly on par with most other countries, but some
critics here say the mortality rate among seniors could have been far
lower with adequate preparation. In a letter to one of Sweden’s most
prominent newspapers, Dagens Nyheter, [22
scientists](https://www.dn.se/debatt/folkhalsomyndigheten-har-misslyckats-nu-maste-politikerna-gripa-in/)
accused the Public Health Authority of negligence.

“They tell people, stay home, but they also keep the restaurants open,”
said Lena Einhorn, a virologist and one of the signatories of the
letter. “They are advising people working in elderly homes only to wear
masks when a patient is sick. Their policies are both ambiguous and
rigid.”

In the absence of recommendations from the Public Health Authority, a
Jewish care home near Stockholm unilaterally decided to ban visitors,
said Aviva Kraitsik, the head of operations, who asked that the
facility’s name be withheld because of previous threats it has
received.

The health authority even went so far as to order the “no visitors”
signs removed. Ms. Kraitsik refused. “I said they could put me behind
bars,” she said. “I was prepared to take my punishment to protect our
residents.”

But it was too late. The virus had already crept inside, and eventually
killed 11 of the 76 inhabitants.

It was only after the home required employees to wear face shields and
masks when working with all the residents, even those displaying no
symptoms, that it managed to halt the spread of the infection, Ms.
Kraitsik said.
