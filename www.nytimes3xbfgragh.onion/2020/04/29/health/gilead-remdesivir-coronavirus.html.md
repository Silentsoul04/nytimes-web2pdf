<div class="css-53u6y8">

Modest results from a federal trial of an experimental drug helped send
the stock market soaring on Wednesday, another sign of the desperation
for a viable treatment against the coronavirus.

Just before markets opened, Gilead, maker of the antiviral drug
remdesivir, announced that it was “aware of positive data” about the
drug’s performance in a federal trial, sending futures upward. Trading
in the company’s shares was briefly halted.

Later, in a briefing at the White House, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director
of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the
trial had shown that treatment with the drug could modestly speed
recovery in patients infected with the coronavirus.

The improvement in recovery times “doesn’t seem like a knockout 100
percent,” Dr. Fauci conceded, but “it is a very important proof of
concept, because what it has proven is that a drug can block this
virus.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sitting at Dr. Fauci’s side, President Trump said, “Certainly it’s
positive, it’s a very positive event.” In past weeks, he has repeatedly
hailed remdesivir as a potential “game changer,” despite spotty
evidence.

Business leaders, scientists and politicians alike are scrambling to
find ways to fight an insidious epidemic and to reopen a devastated
economy. The virus has claimed at least 60,000 lives in the United
States, and more than 200,000 worldwide. There have been precious few
reasons for optimism, and the markets seized on the news.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases enrolled 1,063 patients who were given remdesivir or a placebo.
The time to recovery averaged 11 days among those who got the drug,
compared with 15 days for those who got the placebo.

There were fewer deaths in the remdesivir group, but the result did not
reach statistical significance, Dr. Fauci said. Deaths were not a
primary measure in the trial.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Fauci cautioned that the results of the study still needed to be
properly peer-reviewed, but he was optimistic that remdesivir would
become “the standard of care” for patients with
Covid-19.

Some scientists were unsettled by the way in which the findings were
reported. The disclosure of trial results in a political setting, before
peer review or publication, is very unusual, said Dr. Steven Nissen, a
cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who has conducted dozens of
clinical trials.

“Where are the data?” he asked. Scientists will need to see figures on
harms associated with the drug in order to assess its benefits, he
added.

“This is too important to be handled in such a sloppy fashion,” Dr.
Nissen said.

Dr. Michele Barry, a global health expert at Stanford University, said
she had faith in Dr. Fauci’s assessment. Still, she added, “It is
unusual to call a drug the ‘standard of care’ until peer review of data
and publication, and before studies have shown benefit in mortality.”

The Food and Drug Administration is likely at some point to announce an
emergency approval for remdesivir, a senior administration official told
The New York Times. Another drug touted by the president,
hydrochloroquine, also was granted such an approval, but results in
patients have been disappointing.

In one study of veterans with Covid-19, those receiving hydrochloroquine
and an antibiotic died at higher rates than those given ordinary
supportive care.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Mr. Trump also hopes to put in place a crash program to develop a
vaccine, an undertaking being seen with skepticism even inside the
administration. The accelerated process, known internally as Operation
Warp Speed, would aim to produce hundreds of millions of doses by the
end of this year.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But medical experts, including Dr. Fauci, have warned that developing a
vaccine will require a year to 18 months at the earliest, and that
rushing the process could endanger public health.

For now, drug treatment seems a more attainable goal.

“Remdesivir is not a magic bullet, but it’s as good as we get right
now,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at
the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the trial’s
investigators.

“Patients come to the hospital thinking we have a treatment, and by
treatment, they mean a drug,” he added. “We have been impotent in not
having any options.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Remdesivir has never been approved as a treatment for any disease. It
was developed to fight Ebola, but results from a clinical trial in
Africa were disappointing.

But as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, the drug emerged as one of
the more promising potential treatments. It interrupts the production of
the virus in lab studies and seems safe in
animals.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

of Medicine, lending credibility to what researchers said were actually
uncertain results.

Without trials comparing the drug to a placebo, it has been impossible
to know whether the drug made a difference or patients got better on
their own with normal supportive care.

A separate study of remdesivir, published on Wednesday in The Lancet,
[found no benefit to the drug, compared with
placebo](https://info.thelancet.com/e2t/c/*W5Lhn838fnW_3W4sm_Wg5QQHzp0/*W5r1Ssg7F8LYhW2vgqZF25s9wN0/5/f18dQhb0Sq5G8XYcl9W7cBCZh2qwv15N4cqMnwqd32pMf5gd4XD6prW7cmS1s8pCQ6vW1mbWlS51fy5BW1mZkg96PZgJcW6253v925_ybHN1fkGplKzm2PN5nYjTX6nKnZVtMd0d4gt1GhW7vVV9F1XJ6fhW57jZ6S8_1Q19W49wcLf2LRNVfW4bJ02h4b_rKwW7MbC3t490HkzVWnFLM4LzjSNW7-XB_567h1CPW8r5GVd2GRw4YW3HtrQn2K4XMjW8tzC3F8q-1tCN1KHWqCRFkK4W5G18Kh3y9KYQW3dgtM73TW-bPW44SfhK8LmYtqW61pGpf2Z_1FDN2_yx0RMHdTrVVyvfc3T_7nPW13211g8zzbM9W8LQbGP8k1lZBW8bCgv05CG9_9W8p-_Z43XZzCFW8fHR_k10p3ZcW8bJghY43Rx5xW17pGy38dQmZsW6wydXJ392FRmW4YxKrk4PxC8jW448k6V2YN1mWW3BYbdm3sfwJ-W41Tj081CSMcvW8mhVQY5GJkvkW1TxRJq25y1NZW65rp9c82Z63tW7m73CJ8rdTqcW7C2cLb7D7HxjW1Dy_KC77gPCSf3S9Pl404).

“Unfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately
tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over
placebo,” said the lead investigator of the new study, Dr. Bin Cao of
the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in
Beijing.

“This is not the outcome we hoped for,” he added.

The results are hard to interpret, because the study was far smaller
than planned — enrolling 236 patients instead of the 453 that had been
expected, because there were too few severely ill patients now in China.

Dr. Eric Peterson, a clinical trials expert at Duke University, said
that with too few patients, “all you can say is it doesn’t seem to work
in this population.” If there had been a big effect of the drug, he
added, that would have been seen.

He added that the trial should not be repeated with this population, but
instead in those who are less severely ill.

“This is a flawed study,” Dr. Barry said, but results might improve if
the drug were given at a higher dose or earlier in the course of the
disease.

Acceding to demands, Gilead has distributed the drug to hundreds of
patients under so-called compassionate use, a regulatory exemption by
which patients may receive a drug apart from a clinical trial.

Gilead itself published reports of uncontrolled studies. On Wednesday,
in another news release, the company announced that a study comparing a
five- to 10-day course of treatment with the drug showed that those
getting the shorter course of treatment did just as well.

That study had no control group and was “noninformative,” Dr. Peterson
said.
