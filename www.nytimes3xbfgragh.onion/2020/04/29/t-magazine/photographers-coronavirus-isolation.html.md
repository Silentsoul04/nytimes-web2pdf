“Like a high-strung racehorse who needs extra weight in her saddle pad,
I like a handicap and relish the aesthetic challenge posed by the
limitations of the ordinary,” writes the photographer Sally Mann in her
memoir, “[Hold
Still](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sally-mann/hold-still/9780316247757/)”
(2015). In our stilled, stalled time, her words ring especially true.
Here we all are, burdened by untold fears, forced to make do, to
essentialize, to improvise. And also, within all of this, to open our
eyes and attend to new possibilities.

Of course, attention is the linchpin of image-making, and so T asked a
number of photographers, many of whom typically derive inspiration from
the wider world, how they are approaching this newfound intimacy with
the ordinary, and to share what they have invented within it. Some
relayed mystical encounters with nature and the animal world: Domingo
Milella discovered ancient symbols on the rugged outskirts of Bari,
Italy; [Richard
Mosse](http://www.richardmosse.com/projects/incoming#home) communed with
the craggy topography of the Burren landscape in Ireland; [Asako
Narahashi](http://03fotos.com/asako-narahashi/), in Japan, found solace
alongside a rescued cat. On the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, [Wayne
Lawrence](http://waynelawrenceonline.com/) embraced proximity to family
and the lush surroundings, while in wintry Minnesota, [Alec
Soth](https://alecsoth.com/photography/) gave in to distance by
chronicling his neighborhood through a pair of binoculars, capturing the
feeling of being at once near and far, sheltered and susceptible.

Others have found ongoing projects imbued with fresh relevance. For his
series “Chance and Necessity,” Hitoshi Fugo captured the drama and
beauty of everyday mishaps in his Tokyo kitchen. On the beaches of Long
Island, [Renée Cox](https://www.reneecox.org/) considered the
multiplicity of the self in this moment of collective inwardness. So,
too, did [Joel Meyerowitz](https://www.joelmeyerowitz.com/), who began a
daily ritual of self-portraiture at the start of the year, and for whom
the act of facing oneself honestly is a kind of celebration.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Indeed, the wide-ranging images here acknowledge but don’t limit
themselves to melancholy; rather, they hold intrigue, affirmation and
even delight, reminding us that, as Meyerowitz says, photography is a
hopeful art form, an act of “saying yes,” of staying awake to the world
— which, as the pandemic continues to push us into retreat, is as
vital a task as ever.

On New Year’s Day, I thought, “What could I do this year that would be a
challenge?” I’d never really done self-portraits, so I decided to take
one a day, every day, for a year. Most of the time, if you do a
self-portrait, you take one or two or 10. And very often people try to
make themselves look as attractive as can be. But I want to leave my ego
at the door and see myself at the age that I am, looking the way that I
look — I realize I’m not the dashing street photographer I once was. And
I’m trying to add risky components so that the work remains chancey and
even provocative. I want the picture to be somewhat out of control and
clumsy or rude or
careless.

The Leicas I use have a 12-second timer, so you can set up the frame and
then live in it doing what you’re doing: chopping vegetables, dining
with someone, polishing your shoes, who knows. It’s as if I have a
live-in personal photographer doing a story on my life, but here the
camera is capturing all the moments that someone else couldn’t, like
when I’m in the shower, when I’m taking a bath with my wife. I find a
lot of the pictures I make are of me looking. Because that’s what my
life has been. In one photograph, I was lying on the floor doing my
stretches, and I looked up and saw a plaster circle on the ceiling. And
I thought, “Suppose the camera was where I am now, looking at me looking
up at that
circle.”

When I started the project, I could work in crowds. But now, my cast of
characters is me, myself, and I … and my wife, Maggie. So that’s four of
us. And the question is how to keep it interesting, especially in a
small apartment. One of the pictures I made on the street while we were
taking a walk. I passed someone’s house and a flower was on the little
pedestal at the entranceway. I walked over and my shadow fell over it,
and the flower was where my heart
is.

I’m 82 years old, and I’m in that vulnerable group. Plus, I have a
compromised respiratory system because after 9/11, I spent nine months
taking pictures at ground zero. Many painters start painting the four
seasons, or decaying fruit and flowers, in their later years. I’m
looking at themes of life, aging and death here — *this is what you look
like now, this is what you’re stuck with* — but trying to have fun
within the limitations. I’m willing to be the fool, in a sense, in my
own story line. Whatever comes to mind, I’ll try it. It’s actually very
optimistic. I’ve always felt that photography is a positive art form.
Every time I press a button on the camera, I’m saying yes to something I
saw, something that woke me up. Even in the face of disasters and
plagues, one has to look for the positive qualities that give us the
energy to
continue.

I’m at home with two kids and my wife and many animals: two dogs, three
cats, an iguana and a hamster. I couldn’t pick up a real camera to take
pictures, because that felt too much like being a real photographer. I
didn’t want to give it that sense of authority. I was just kind of
overwhelmed, and I’m not a photographer who runs toward crisis. But I
had this memory of using binoculars on a safari a few years ago. I found
that looking through them renders space really beautifully — it makes
faraway things close but in a peculiar way. On a whim, I put my iPhone
up to the binoculars and started taking pictures. It’s clumsy and really
hard to do — the power of binoculars is not as strong as most telephoto
lenses on a camera — but I kind of enjoyed the game of
it.

So I pulled out those same binoculars and drove around in the bubble of
my minivan looking for signs of life. Nowadays, it feels like everything
is seen through panes of glass. Binoculars have multiple layers of
glass, and I shot these pictures through the added layer on the iPhone,
as well as through the car windows. So, distance, distance,
distance.

The picture of the house with the arched window has this lens
aberration. I like how the bubble’s colors are similar to those of the
fabric hanging in the window. It’s one of those beautiful accidents. The
very stalker-ish photo of the guy in the window was hard to do
technically, because of the binoculars and the low light and the need
for the guy to stay
still.

My photography has always been about social distance, in a way. Social
awkwardness, social distance, all of those things. I’ve always thought
about this in terms of the lens, that this piece of glass is separating
me and protecting me in some ways from the world. The thing I’m trying
to process now relates to the larger ethical meaning of being a
photographer. I’m always conflicted about using people as fodder for my
artistic pursuits. And this idea of traveling great distances, driving
all over, using gas, flying places, and spreading things — is that
really the best way to be in the world? That’s partly why I admire
photographers who make work at home and teach us how to be observant of
our own lives. What will it mean for me to be an ethical photographer in
whatever new world comes out of
this?

With these photos, I was following a self-portraiture assignment I gave
to my students. I think this is a time when you can really explore
yourself, because you’re not going to be setting up shoots; you’re not
going to be working with other people. And that’s what I’ve been doing.
Being an artist has been my solace; it provides me with a certain degree
of therapy. I’m in my house with my family, but I can still get in my
car and drive to the lighthouse, take photographs on the beach. I might
see one other
person.

“Self-Portrait Rocks” was me in Montauk alone. It’s a composite, a
meditation. I was feeling almost buried, asking myself, “OK, what’s
next? ** How long are we here?” “Me, Myself & I” was initially shot in
the city, and then I manipulated it after coming out here. In my studio,
I’ve placed two mirrors at a 70-degree angle — an old photo carnival
trick. The image is a séance of sorts that draws on spirit photography
from the late 1800s. I was thinking about the idea of solitude but also
the question: Are we ever really alone? I hear people saying, “I’m
bored, I’m bored,” and I think, “It’s because you’re bored with
yourself.” You’ve got to learn to love yourself, to have a conversation
with
yourself.

“Covid-19 Neon Self-Portrait” is another composite. Once you start going
down this path of looking within, then hopefully some light gets shed.
I’m trying to be grounded in the present moment. As we get further
into the pandemic, that becomes a part of the message: Deal with this
now, as opposed to thinking about when it’s going to be over, or when
you can get back to what you were doing before. For all the control
freaks of the world, it must be pure hell, but I think the lesson to be
learned is: Wait a second, maybe give up that control. And what kind of
control are you seeking
anyway?

This crisis feels like an archetypal call from the forest, the animals,
the place we inhabit. It is a very deeply ecological crisis, and I don’t
think we can separate the virus from what we’ve been doing in the
industrial age. If we keep talking about stock markets, I think we will
have failed to understand. The words “economic,” “ecological” and
“ecosystemic” all lead back to the Greek word *oikonomos*, and the
idea of home, the rules of the house. Perhaps, while confined, we can
rethink how the earth is also our home. And it’s not a private home but
a collective
one.

The virus, too, is that rare thing that puts us all in front of a
similar event. I think this is very powerful; there is something
religious about it, even. There are days I’m desperate and want to cry,
and others when I see the possibilities for harmony and for beauty and
art. I usually work with my big black box camera and camera obscura and
do not share images taken on my phone, as these were. But the moment of
crisis made me feel as though I had permission to focus on quotidian
elements. I’ve been in this suburban tower, which was built by my uncle
and is where I grew up, for 40 days already. My whole family is here, on
different levels — I’m on the 13th floor, my parents are on the 12th, my
cousin is on the 11th. Down below is a Pasolini-looking countryside,
with views of project housing, the Adriatic Sea, villas from the 1700s,
bunkers from World War II, olive trees, a railway and some junk from
previous
buildings.

The pictures I made are about being confined but also about being
resourceful in the way of a child, about looking at things with purity
and listening to the wind. Now, we have to re-challenge our imagination.
I took some pictures of a fig tree and some leaves. One day, on my way
to the tree, I met a very big black snake. It so happens that the night
before, I had taken out a skin of a different snake that I had in a
little box in my apartment. I put the skin next to a little puff of
white feather that had fallen off one of the peregrine falcons flying
by. I told my friend about all of this, and they sent me a picture from
the Middle Ages of Adam, Eve and a fig tree with a big snake wrapped
around it. Sometimes, when you stop and take time to meet a snake or
follow the flight of a falcon, something magical starts to
happen.

This series, “Chance and Necessity,” came out of two incidents I had in
the kitchen of my home in Tokyo about a year ago. I attempted to toast
leftover dumpling dough wrappers to transform them into croutons for
salad. However, I kept them in my toaster too long and ended up burning
them thoroughly. Then, I caught my breath at the radiant, black charred
wrappers. Another time, I dropped a bunch of very thin dry somen
noodles, and they scattered on the kitchen floor. They created a
stunning, unexpected image of overlapping straight lines. These moments
led me to start a new photographic series, which includes these pictures
I made in the last couple of weeks, during the
quarantine.

This theme of chance and necessity is something I have long been
interested in, but the timeliness now is miraculous. It’s about using
what you have. What I’m creating is a consequence of the collaboration
between chance and the photographer. The artwork is not the black
charred wrappers or scattered noodles themselves; it is the photographic
images that
emerge.

Now, we are experiencing fear of something not visible. We last had that
during the Fukushima nuclear disaster nine years ago. We didn’t know
what it would be like the next day, or the next week, and we were also
scared by something we could not see. People tend to think that
photographers take pictures of things that you can see, but I’m now
realizing that it might be more important to express the opposite, what
is *not*
seeable.

        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

I got this cat from a shelter for rescues last summer, and I’m keeping

I have always thought that wandering through the hills and the fractured
limestone strata of the Burren landscape feels something like mapping
the striations of one’s own mind. This is a land of texture, and it
often takes some concentration on the ground in front of you not to trip
up or fall into any of the “clints” or “grikes,” the furrowed
delineations created by millions of years of rain erosion. One must
remain focused on each step and absorbed in the present moment. This
helps distill the mind. As a photographer and as a walker, I see this
landscape inwardly, as an expression of layers of thought that become
especially evident after prolonged periods of isolation. I tried to
capture that in this mini-series, as it has been important to me.
Isolation, I’ve found, can be
centering.

One of the photos shows a rag tree, which is an ancient practice in
Ireland that descends from pagan times. It is a kind of shamanic site
where people come to be healed. Those with illness and ailments will
make a pilgrimage to the site, bringing some old rag or memento that
represents their sickness and tie it to the rag tree. Doing so is said
to heal the malady, if not physically then in some spiritual way. When
Christianity arrived in Ireland in the Dark Ages, the church
appropriated this practice, and so these sites have survived and are
still popular. The spring bubbling from the rocks beneath this tree is
considered a source of holy water — it’s known locally as a holy well —
and there are some glass mugs hanging from nails for believers to use to
drink from the purifying stream. I have visited this rag tree for many
years but have never seen it so heavily strewn with rags and other
tokens.

I think this moment may be the death of analog photography. And of
course, the art world was always very interpersonal, relational. It was
about showing up to talks, openings, visiting museums, experiencing the
work in person. All that seems like a memory now, replaced by the
digital. This truly has locked us, at least for now, into viewing
photography on social media and online. It will take a lot to return to
the emphasis there was, until recently, on showing up in person, on
giving the work the space to breathe. One could argue that this has the
potential to democratize photography, but remember that each time you
upload an image to social media, you’re giving away the rights to a
massive corporation. It’s incredibly important for us, as humans, to
show up and be present in order to create society. That’s dangerous to
do now, and also currently illegal for many people, so I feel nervous
about what we stand to lose, particularly in regard to human rights and
liberal democracy.

Whatever happens after this, we have to adapt. We have to keep living,
and we have to keep creating. Now, I’m just living day by day, thankful
for every day I can wake up and smell some fresh air and pick some fresh
fruit off my tree. I’ve always been an introvert, so this type of living
is not new to me. I just stepped onto my balcony, and the breeze outside
is amazing. It’s the first time we’ve had this kind of breeze in about
two weeks, and it’s just what I needed.
