Scientists at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute raised hopes this
week when they announced plans to expand testing for a potential
[coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccines.html)
that if proven effective could be ready for emergency use [as soon as
September](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html).
But as my colleague Stuart Thompson
[explains](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html),
that’s an enormous if: Most vaccines take a decade or longer to make,
and none has ever been developed in less than four years.

Cutting that record down to 12 or even 18 months would already require
moving at “pandemic speed.” But last week, [35 members of
Congress](https://foster.house.gov/sites/foster.house.gov/files/2020.04.20_Ltr%20to%20HHS%20%20FDA%20on%20Rapid%20Vaccine%20Deployment%20for%20COVID-19%20-%20Signed.pdf)
proposed an extraordinary practice that some scientists think could
compress the timeline even further: deliberately infecting volunteers.
Here’s what people are saying about the idea, known as human challenge.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Why would we intentionally infect people?

As it happens, the Jenner Institute is named for [Edward
Jenner,](https://www.jenner.ac.uk/about/edward-jenner) who invented the
world’s first vaccine by doing just this. In 1796, more than a century
before anyone even knew what a virus was, Mr. Jenner suspected that
cowpox, a mild disease that milkmaids sometimes contracted, might confer
immunity against the far more deadly smallpox. To test his theory, he
inoculated an 8-year-old boy with the first virus (courtesy of a
Gloucester cow named Blossom) and then deliberately infected — or
“challenged” — him with the second.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Jenner’s theory proved correct — “vaccine” derives from “vacca*,”*
the Latin word for cow — but his method has always been [ethically
fraught](https://theconversation.com/judging-jenner-was-his-smallpox-experiment-really-unethical-54362).
Today, human-challenge studies are subject to strict oversight and
authorized only for diseases that have treatments, like malaria or the
flu. Any potential vaccine now also has to undergo three phases of
clinical trials. Efficacy is tested in the third phase, where instead of
being deliberately infected, participants simply go about their daily
lives and researchers see whether those who received the vaccine prove
less likely to contract the disease than those who received a placebo.

**But the pandemic has raised two concerns with the process:**

  - Right now, most people are trying *not* to get sick: The Jenner
    Institute’s director has said that if the infection rate continues
    to slow in Britain, researchers may not be able to determine whether
    the vaccine works.

  - Trials take time: The first phase typically takes months, and the
    second two take years.

**As a result, some experts have called for replacing conventional Phase
III testing with human-challenge trials.** In The Journal of Infectious
Diseases last month, the bioethicist Nir Eyal and the epidemiologists
Marc Lipsitch and Peter Smith
[argued](https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa152/5814216#201727802)
that the idea, while risky, could shave months off the process. “Every
week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many
thousands of deaths globally,” they wrote. “If the use of human
challenge helped to make the vaccine available before the epidemic has
completely passed, the savings in human lives could be in the thousands
or conceivably millions.”

## How would it work?

In the authors’ proposed design, the study would rely entirely on young,
healthy volunteers who fully understand the risks of participating. (To
the authors, “young” might mean 20 to 45; to others, [18
to 30](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/speed-coronavirus-vaccine-testing-deliberately-infecting-volunteers-not-so-fast-some#)
or [even 18
to 25](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/9/21209593/coronavirus-vaccine-human-trials-explained).)
Conventional Phase III trials typically require thousands of volunteers,
but a human-challenge trial might need only 100. All participants would
remain isolated in comfortable state-of-the-art facilities, with access
to “excellent” health care.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Who in the world would volunteer to get infected?

**Actually, a lot of people,** according to Josh Morrison and Sophie
Rose, the co-founders of an organization called
[1DaySooner](https://1daysooner.org/), which has gathered signatures
from over 8,000 potential volunteers. In The Washington Post, Mr.
Morrison and Ms. Rose
[argue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/27/vaccine-infection-volunteer-coronavirus/)
that the idea is not as radical as it sounds:
[According](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(20\)30243-7/fulltext)
to one study, the coronavirus’s fatality rate for 20- to 29-year-olds in
China was 3 in 10,000 — the same as that of [kidney
donation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22732041) surgery and
roughly twice that of
[childbirth](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm)in
the United States.

“We and many others are willing to take on what we see as an acceptable
individual risk to serve the public and the people we care about,” they
write. “As willing and well-informed volunteers, whose autonomy ought to
be respected, we feel challenge trials are justified if they mean a
vaccine arrives even one day sooner.”

## Would it be ethical?

**We already allow people to risk their lives for the collective good,**
Dr. Lipsitch, Dr. Eyal and Dr. Smith say. Firefighters, for example, are
routinely called upon to rush into burning buildings. (And today, of
course, delivery drivers and grocery clerks are being asked to accept a
level of risk they did not sign up for.) The question, then, is whether
the study’s potential cost would be low enough to warrant its potential
benefit. Besides recruiting only healthy, young volunteers and
guaranteeing them the best care, the authors delineate four ways in
which the study would minimize net risk:

  - The vaccine may protect some of those who receive it.

  - Absent an effective vaccine, a high proportion of the general
    population is likely to get Covid-19, so some volunteers may simply
    be pushing their illnesses forward.

  - Only people who already have an especially high risk of exposure
    would be recruited (e.g., New Yorkers).

  - Volunteers would get priority for any treatments that may become
    available.

**But many researchers and bioethicists balk at the idea of coronavirus
human-challenge trials,** Jon Cohen
[writes](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/speed-coronavirus-vaccine-testing-deliberately-infecting-volunteers-not-so-fast-some#)
in Science magazine. For one thing, the risks are hard to gauge, since
the virus is so new that we don’t know how often people get seriously
ill or what its long-term complications are. “Where you’re going to give
somebody a virus on purpose, you really want to understand the disease
so that you know that what you’re doing is a reasonable risk,” Matthew
Memoli, an immunologist who stages human-challenge studies of influenza,
told Mr. Cohen.

**There are also thorny ethical questions beyond risks and benefits,**
according to Seema Shah, a medical ethics professor at Northwestern
University. “Justice considerations also matter, such as whether the
risks are fairly distributed,” [she
told](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/9/21209593/coronavirus-vaccine-human-trials-explained)Vox.
“There are also other criteria: community engagement, fair selection of
participants, robust informed consent, and payment that compensates for
time and inconveniences.” And there lies another point of contention:
Dr. Eyal [advises](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00927-3)
against using high payments, which he says could take advantage of the
poor.

## Would it be worth it?

**It’s possible that human-challenge trials wouldn’t actually speed up
the process,** according to Myrone Levine, a vaccine researcher at the
University of Maryland who has conducted challenge trials since the
1970s. Infections are still climbing rapidly in many places, so
conventional trials could reveal a vaccine’s efficacy on the same
timeline. “I cannot imagine that this would be ethical and would really
speed up what we have to do,” Dr. Levine told Mr. Cohen.

**The benefit would also hinge on getting a lot of administrative ducks
in a row,** Dr. Shah said. For example, researchers would need to
coordinate globally to ensure consistency across trials and to ascertain
whether the Food and Drug Administration would even accept the results.
And as Dr. Lipsitch, Dr. Eyal and Dr. Smith acknowledged, even if all
goes well, more studies might be needed to prove the vaccine is safe and
effective for older populations.

“We’re all looking for a Hail Mary, and it’s easy to see challenge
studies as exciting and having a lot of promise,” Dr. Shah said. “But a
lot of things need to fall into place to achieve that promise.”

### <span>WHAT YOU’RE SAYING</span>

*Here’s what readers had to say about the last edition:* [*Biden’s
vice-presidential
pick*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/opinion/biden-vice-president.html)

John C. Kornblum, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany, from Berlin:
“What about Val Demings, representative from Florida? She is
experienced, well spoken and did very well during impeachment hearings.
Demographically, who could be against a black, female former police
chief from FLORIDA.” (Tom Coleman, a former Republican congressman, also
wrote in to recommend Ms. Demings.)

Alma from New Mexico: “You did not mention Michelle Lujan Grisham,
governor of New Mexico and former chair of the congressional Hispanic
caucus. She has received national accolades for her handling of
Covid-19. She is popular with both progressives and moderates.”

Bruce from Hong Kong: “I can’t understand why no one is mentioning Susan
Rice, who should be the front-runner. Highly intelligent and effective
and demographically appropriate, Rice would be the perfect foil for
Biden.”

Deb from Minnesota: “What prior experience did Trump have to qualify
him?”
