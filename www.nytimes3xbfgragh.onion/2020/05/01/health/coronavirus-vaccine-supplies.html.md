In the midst of national shortages of testing swabs and protective gear,
some medical suppliers and health policy experts are looking ahead to
another extraordinary demand on manufacturing: Delivering a vaccine that
could potentially end the pandemic.

Making a vaccine is not easy. More than two dozen companies have
announced programs to develop a [vaccine against the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html),
but it may still take a year or more before one passes federal safety
and efficacy tests in humans and becomes available to the public.

Here in the United States, more than 300 million people may need to be
inoculated. That means at least as many vials and syringes — or double
that amount, if two shots are required. To meet that demand, companies
will have to ramp up manufacturing; products that doctors give little
thought to now could easily become obstacles to vaccine delivery in the
future.

“We’re thinking about the vaccine, but what if the vials it is stored
in, or rubber stoppers in the vial or the plungers in the syringes
become the constraint?” said Prashant Yadav, who studies health care
supply chains at the Center for Global Development in Washington.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Timing the orders of medical products like syringes and all the raw
materials required to make them will be essential. Medical device
manufacturers could increase inventory or find alternative supply chains
for products that are running low, but everything will need to be
systematically planned. Adding the capacity to make millions more
syringes could take a manufacturer as long as 18 months to complete such
a large order, for example.

“The Covid-19 pandemic is creating industrywide challenges, including
expected delays in inventory replenishment for certain products,” said
Lucy Bradlow, a spokeswoman for Cardinal Health, which makes vials and
syringes as well as other medical supplies.

Several manufacturers worry that the Trump administration may be waiting
too long before ordering an ample supply of medical equipment needed to
deliver a vaccine. One manufacturer said it had recently received an
order for syringes, but was concerned that the Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority, a branch of the Health and Human
Services Department built to help with pandemic preparedness, was still
soliciting too few supplies for nationwide vaccine
delivery.

The White House is also developing a plan, called [Operation Warp
Speed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-operation-warp-speed.html),
to accelerate vaccine production and try to get manufacturing capacity
set up in advance of a vaccine approval. But some experts say that it is
unclear whether the plan would apply to vaccine delivery devices like
syringes, and details are still scarce about which federal agency would
be responsible.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

In April, New Hampshire’s senators, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan,
sent [a letter to Vice President Mike
Pence](https://www.shaheen.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020-04-21%20Letter%20to%20VP%20Pence%20on%20Vaccine%20Materials%20-%20Shaheen%20&%20Hassan.pdf),
urging him “to ensure that the federal government obtains the materials
to meet the demand for a vaccine when it becomes available.”

Of course, a lot will depend on the type of vaccine and when it is
approved. A variety of [RNA- and DNA-based
vaccines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html)
are currently undergoing clinical trials, as well as more traditional
types, which are made by placing instructions for coronavirus spike
proteins inside a different dead or harmless virus.

RNA or DNA vaccines might have different storage and refrigeration
requirements because the technology has never been used for an approved
vaccine before. The final vaccine might be packaged in ready-to-use
glass syringes, which are commonly used in flu campaigns in Europe, or
in a single-dose or multidose vials that would be administered with
disposable plastic syringes, which are standard for many vaccines in the
United States.

The amount of vaccine manufactured by a company could also affect the
number of delivery systems needed, said Michael Gusmano, a health policy
expert at the Hastings Center and Rutgers School of Public Health. It is
unlikely that a pharmaceutical company will be able to match demand
immediately — nationally or internationally.

“The good news is we have time,” Dr. Gusmano said. Medical device
manufacturers could slowly scale up vials and syringes as a vaccine
becomes more widely available.

Early estimates of the coronavirus’s infectiousness suggest that at
least 70 percent of the population would need to be immunized to reach
what experts call [herd
immunity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/health/coronavirus-antibody-test.html),
when enough people are immune to a disease that they can also indirectly
protect others who are not
immune.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

“That’s a remarkably high number, and I don’t think we’re anywhere close
to that just with people who have been exposed to the virus and
developed antibodies,” Dr. Gusmano said. “So you’re talking about a
fairly massive vaccination campaign.”

Preliminary surveys in
[California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/health/coronavirus-antibodies-california.html)
and [New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html)
suggest that between 4 to 21 percent of people have developed antibodies
to the coronavirus. But the accuracy of many [antibody tests has been
called into
question](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/19/us/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html).
And it is still unclear whether having some of these antibodies provides
effective and [long-lasting
immunity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/04/25/world/americas/25reuters-health-coronavirus-who.html)
against the coronavirus. Plus, most vaccination campaigns aim to
immunize a high proportion of the population — around 90 percent — to
successfully prevent transmission of disease.

To produce the number of vials and syringes needed for a coronavirus
vaccine, medical suppliers will need to increase manufacturing shifts
and overtime for their employees, as well as collaborate with American
and foreign trade authorities to expedite shipments and shorten lead
times.

A handful of manufacturers are based in the United States, but many
still have to import the glass tubing for vials, polypropylene for
syringes and rubber or silicone for small parts like the stoppers and
plungers in these devices. Becton Dickinson & Company, one of the
world’s largest manufacturers of needles and syringes, said it made
nearly all components of its needles and syringes in-house in the United
States. Other companies may source from their factories and partners
located largely in China and India, where lockdowns and export bans have
already decreased production and exports.

Although syringe manufacturing is [mostly
automated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFQApDeslS0&feature=youtu.be),
with parts like the barrel and plunger made from a mold and put together
on an assembly line, Dr. Yadav said manufacturers in India had told him
fewer employees were able to work than needed for full capacity.

At least 69 countries have also banned or restricted the export of
medical devices, medicines and protective equipment, according to the
Global Trade Alert project at the University of St. Gallen in
Switzerland, because of their own needs during the pandemic.
Manufacturers of medical syringes may have to find new supply channels,
including partnerships with glass and plastic manufacturers that operate
outside of the health care industry.

Some lawmakers are concerned that without more federal coordination,
individual companies will not have the capacity to match vaccine
delivery to the overwhelming demand.

“The Trump administration needs to prepare our domestic supply chain now
for the delivery of an eventual vaccine that will need to be delivered
to the entire country,” Senator Shaheen said. “It’s vital that federal
agencies exercise better foresight so that we don’t see supply shortages
like we continue to experience for testing and protective equipment.”
