<span class="css-ggqk20 ethc9we0">I</span>n March, as a wave of states
began delaying their spring primaries because of the coronavirus,
Wisconsin’s election, scheduled for April 7, loomed. The ballot for that
day included the presidential
[primary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/us/politics/atlanta-voting-georgia-primary.html),
thousands of local offices and four judgeships, including a key seat on
the Wisconsin Supreme Court. On March 17, the day after Ohio postponed
its spring election, [voting
rights](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/john-lewis-voting-rights-act.html)
groups asked Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, to do the
same. “No one wanted the election to happen more than us, but it felt
like this wave was about to hit our communities,” Angela Lang, the
founder and executive director of the Milwaukee group Black Leaders
Organizing for Community, a nonprofit organization, told me.

While Evers weighed the idea of postponement, BLOC encouraged residents
to apply for absentee ballots, which any registered Wisconsin voter can
do by requesting one online. But some voters were struggling to figure
out how to upload their identification from their phones to the state’s
MyVote website. City officials reported that they couldn’t keep up with
the overwhelming demand for absentee ballots; applications in Milwaukee
rose from a typical daily count of 100 or so to between 7,000 and 8,000.
“People were waiting on their ballots and asking where they were,” Lang
said. “We needed a plan. But we knew the governor was in a tough
position with the Legislature.”

The Wisconsin Assembly and Senate are firmly in the hands of
Republicans, [who drew a gerrymandered map a decade
ago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/29/magazine/the-new-front-in-the-gerrymandering-wars-democracy-vs-math.html)
that has allowed them to retain a majority in the State Assembly even
though they won only 47 percent of the vote in 2012 and less than 45
percent in 2018. Lang, who is 30, grew up in the city and started BLOC
to increase political engagement — and power — in Milwaukee’s mostly
black and low-income neighborhoods. And Evers won in 2018 (defeating
Scott Walker, a Republican seeking a third term) [thanks in part to
larger-than-usual turnout by black and Latino
voters.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/black-and-latino-turnout-helped-defeat-scott-walker/575818/)

It wasn’t clear whether the governor had the legal authority to suspend
the election, and at the end of March, rather than calling for a
postponement, Evers asked the Legislature to send [mail-in
ballots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/politics/voting-by-mail-georgia.html)
to every registered voter, regardless of whether they had applied for
one. The Senate majority leader, Scott Fitzgerald, ridiculed the idea as
a “complete fantasy.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On March 26, BLOC and several other groups joined a lawsuit that argued
for postponing the election because local officials would find it
“functionally impossible” to conduct it properly. The suit was one of
three election-related cases in Wisconsin that were consolidated before
U.S. District Judge William Conley. On April 2, [Conley
ruled](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/ill-advised-election-to-go-on-amid-covid-19-pandemic-judge-says-but-some-absentee/article_8dd80672-af4b-5bc6-b25b-f29b92a78382.html)
that while he recognized that an election on April 7 would create
“unprecedented burdens” for voters, poll workers and the state, the
court could not change the date in lieu of the governor and the
Legislature. Instead, Judge Conley extended the deadline for voters to
return their absentee ballots to April 13, citing the testimony of local
officials that otherwise there would be no way for all the voters asking
to vote by mail to receive and return their ballots in time.

The State Legislature, the state Republican Party and the Republican
National Committee immediately appealed Conley’s ruling. The next day,
April 3, Evers called the Legislature into special session. The governor
said he didn’t have the power to postpone the election on his own,
demanding instead that lawmakers cancel in-person voting and extend the
mail-in deadline to late May. The governor’s political opponents
rejected his request.

As the days ticked by, Milwaukee announced that it could open only five
of its 180 polling places, as poll workers — many of whom were over the
age of 60 and at heightened risk from the virus — pulled out of staffing
them. Green Bay said it could open two of its 31 polling sites. Election
officials rushed out absentee ballots with instructions about the new
April 13 deadline set by Judge Conley, and BLOC reached out to voters by
phone and text, explaining that they would have six extra days to turn
in their ballots.

On April 6, the day before the election, Evers issued an executive order
postponing it for two months, despite his earlier statement that he
lacked this authority. That day, the Wisconsin Supreme Court [blocked
the governor’s order by a 4-to-2
vote.](https://www.wicourts.gov/news/docs/2020AP608_2.pdf) (The seventh
justice, whose seat was up for election, recused himself.) The
conservative majority said that the governor’s authority by law to issue
orders “he or she deems necessary for the security of persons and
property” didn’t mean he could override other valid laws, including
those governing elections.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Later that evening, the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 along
ideological lines and reversed Judge Conley’s decision to extend the
deadline to return mail-in ballots, changing the date back to April 7.
The court’s [unsigned majority
opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19a1016_o759.pdf)
made no provision for the extraordinary circumstances of the
coronavirus. It didn’t mention the people who hadn’t yet received their
ballots, or those who had received instructions with the April 13 return
date. That meant voters still awaiting ballots on April 7 — more than
12,000 statewide, according to preliminary data — had to choose between
braving their polling places or sitting out the election.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Election Day, people stood in lines that wrapped around the block,
trying to keep their distance from one another. Robin Vos, the
Republican leader of the State Assembly,[went on Facebook
Live](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/watch/?v=519791292264353) while
wearing a mask, gloves and full-body protective gear and assured voters
that it was “incredibly safe” to go to the polls. One voter tweeted
about her sister, a cancer survivor who was afraid to go out and expose
herself to the virus but whose absentee ballot hadn’t arrived. “The
hardest was hearing from people who said they marched in the civil
rights era and now they couldn’t vote,” Lang said. For days after the
election, Milwaukee residents continued to take their ballots to library
drop-off sites, following the instructions they received that extended
the deadline to April 13. They would not be counted.

In the end, the liberal candidates won in the three judicial races on
the ballot in which BLOC took a position. Lang didn’t feel like
celebrating, though — she was worried that people who went to the polls
would wind up getting sick. In the weeks after the election, Milwaukee
health officials traced [at least 40
cases](https://www.wuwm.com/post/40-coronavirus-cases-milwaukee-county-linked-wisconsin-election-health-official-says#stream/0)
of the virus to in-person voting.

The election in Wisconsin shows that the coronavirus can block access to
the ballot just as it has closed stores and schools and so much other
civic activity. “Ultimately there were no provisions, no accommodations
in state law for the pandemic when it came to our administration of this
election,” says Neil Albrecht, executive director of the Milwaukee
Election Commission. If states and the federal government don’t do more
to help voters in November — starting now, with urgency — the barriers
for some of them may be insurmountable. “A lot of people suffered
because of the government’s lack of responsiveness,” Albrecht adds.
“What I mean is, they lost their right to vote.”

**A national election** is a giant pop-up event, larger in scale and
significance than any other private or public occasion. Two-thirds of
Americans expect the Covid-19 outbreak to disrupt voting in November,
according to a [late-April survey by the Pew Research
Center.](https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/28/two-thirds-of-americans-expect-presidential-election-will-be-disrupted-by-covid-19/)
A successful election will require some Covid-era changes. The main one
is enabling tens of millions more people to [vote by
mail](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/25/us/vote-by-mail-coronavirus.html)
(also called absentee balloting — the terms are synonymous) than have
ever done so before. It’s also important to make adjustments to keep
polling places open for people who don’t have stable mailing addresses —
a group that increases as people are uprooted during an economic
downturn — or whose disabilities, like blindness, make it hard to fill
out a ballot unassisted.

The outcome of the presidential contest will most likely be decided in a
handful of swing states. This year, the likeliest prospects are
Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona.
All of them, along with 23 other states and the District of Columbia,
already have laws on the books that give voters the right to request an
absentee ballot without an excuse. But only one swing state is already
set up for most people to vote by mail — Arizona, where 79 percent did
so in 2018. In Florida and Michigan, about 25 to 30 percent voted by
mail that year. In Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, very few
voters have voted absentee in a general election; in 2018, the range was
from 3 to 6 percent, [according to The Brennan Center for Justice at New
York University Law
School.](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/preparing-your-state-election-under-pandemic-conditions)(A
total of 27 states fell below 10 percent, including Georgia and New
Hampshire, which also may see close presidential results.)

To fundamentally change the way voting has been done in those states,
they will have to move quickly to sign contracts with vendors and then
order supplies, like specially certified paper for envelopes and
ballots, high-speed scanners to count votes and secure drop-off boxes.
If they wait, they’ll risk running into shortages like the ones that
have troubled the country’s efforts to fight the virus. In Wisconsin in
April, when voting by mail rose to more than 70 percent, totaling over a
million, from around 6 percent in previous elections, many people didn’t
get to vote because counties ran out of envelopes for a time and then
couldn’t fill all the applications for absentee ballots fast enough.
“Wisconsin shows that you can’t adopt vote-by-mail overnight,” says
Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford law professor and the head of the Healthy
Elections Project, a new effort by Stanford and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology to address the threat of Covid-19. “It’s not as
easy as people think. The boring stuff matters — the scut work of supply
chain and logistics and management is crucial.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Significantly changing how elections are carried out will cost money,
and all states face a giant funding gap as they scramble to prepare for
the unknowns of November. [The Brennan Center for Justice
estimates](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures)
the pandemic-associated costs of properly running the 2020 elections
(including the primaries as well as the general) at $4 billion. So far,
Congress has promised $400 million, with Democrats pushing for more and
Republicans blocking their bills. The debate over funding the Postal
Service, which [warns it could run out of operating funds at the end of
September](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/opinion/usps-coronavirus.html),
is similarly split.

In a different world, preparation for the election and its accompanying
costs would be nonpolitical. [Five states currently have universal
vote-by-mail](https://www.voteathome.org/), the system of sending all
registered voters a ballot without requiring them to request one first:
Utah, dominated by Republicans; Hawaii, Oregon and Washington, where
Democrats tend to win; and Colorado, where members of both parties hold
major statewide offices. [A Reuters poll in April
found](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKBN21P3G0)
that 72 percent of Americans want the government to require mail-in
ballots in November to protect voters if the coronavirus continues to
pose a threat, including 65 percent support among Republicans. Some
Republican officials share the majority view: In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine
and Secretary of State Frank LaRose [made a video promoting the state’s
first primary by mail in
June.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYliBlyROxo&feature=youtu.be) “I
wanted to see as much participation as we could get,” LaRose told me.
Chris Sununu, the Republican governor of New Hampshire, [promised voting
by mail for all in
November](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-hampshire-gov-sununu-to-allow-absentee-voting-in-november-because-of-coronavirus-outbreak/2020/04/09/d0aa21c8-7aa2-11ea-a130-df573469f094_story.html),
if the coronavirus is still an issue, despite the state’s usual rule
that voters can only receive an absentee ballot if they have an excuse
like travel or illness.

Researchers have found that vote-by-mail hasn’t obviously helped one
party or the other. Nationwide, about the same share of Republicans and
Democrats voted by mail in 2016, Charles Stewart III, a
political-science professor at M.I.T., found. In partisan terms, “it is
remarkably neutral,” [wrote Andrew
Hall](https://twitter.com/andrewbhall/status/1250104293866098688), a
political-science professor at Stanford University and [an author of
a 2020 study](http://www.andrewbenjaminhall.com/Thompson_et_al_VBM.pdf)
(which hasn’t yet been published) on voting by mail. Hall’s study found
that shifting to mailed ballots has modestly increased turnout — by
about 2 percent — for each party; [a 2013
study](https://isps.yale.edu/research/publications/isps13-012) found
similar
results.

But even if [vote-by-mail hasn’t hurt
them](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/us/politics/vote-by-mail.html),
conservatives have long focused on increased turnout as a threat and
have worked to minimize it. In the days of Jim Crow, conservatives in
the South (who were then generally Democrats) used the blunt tools of
poll taxes and literacy tests to prevent African-Americans from voting.
In the decades after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 stamped out those
forms of overt suppression, [newly elected black legislators and their
allies increased
registration](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/29/magazine/voting-rights-act-dream-undone.html)
with state laws that let people register at the Department of Motor
Vehicles and public-assistance offices, or register at the polls on the
same day they voted. They also increased access by opening polling sites
in the weeks before Election Day.

Republicans generally opposed these efforts. “I don’t want everybody to
vote,” Paul Weyrich, the conservative activist and co-founder of the
Heritage Foundation, said at a meeting in Dallas in 1980. “As a matter
of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the
voting populace goes down.” In the 2000s, [Republicans began passing
strict voter-identification
laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id-history.aspx),
which could be justified as a way to prevent fraud — though in-person
voting fraud is extremely rare. In 2010, after taking control of most
state legislatures, Republicans eliminated early voting and same-day
registration where they could. Since [the Supreme Court effectively
gutted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/07/magazine/the-supreme-court-ruled-that-voting-restrictions-were-a-bygone-problem-early-voting-results-suggest-otherwise.html)
a [key
provision](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/02/the_voting_rights_act_and_shelby_county_v_holder_how_the_supreme_court_could.html)
of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, [more than 1,600 polling places have
been
closed](http://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/reports/Democracy-Diverted.pdf)
across the country.

Trump benefited from decreased turnout in 2016, especially in the vital
swing states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, where
participation by black and Democratic voters declined from the historic
levels that lifted Barack Obama. Wisconsin’s voter-ID law accounted for
some of the decline in turnout in Milwaukee, [according to Neil
Albrecht](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/voter-suppression-wisconsin-election-2016/),
the city election director.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In March, Trump announced his opposition to a Democratic bid to include
at least $2 billion for state election preparation in the $2 trillion
coronavirus relief bill. Republicans usually don’t talk openly about
suppressing turnout in the way that Paul Weyrich did 40 years ago. Trump
broke that rule, saying at a news briefing that he thought his party
would lose if more people voted. The Democrats’ proposals, he said, “had
things — levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never
have a Republican elected in this country again.”

In the weeks that followed, Trump shifted to the preferred Republican
justification for making it harder to vote — preventing fraud. With the
threat of the pandemic rising, he called voting by mail “corrupt,”
imagining “thousands of votes are gathered, and they come in, and
they’re dumped in a location, and then, all of a sudden, you lose
elections you think you’re going to win.” In some states, Republicans
following Trump’s messaging [have denounced
vote-by-mail](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/us/politics/vote-by-mail.html)
as “devastating to Republicans” (David Ralston, the Republican speaker
of the Georgia House), “the apocalypse” ([Jennifer Carnahan, chairwoman
of the Minnesota Republican
Party](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/voting-mail-2020-race-between-biden-and-trump/609799/))
and “the end of our republic as we know it” ([Representative Thomas
Massie of
Kentucky](https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1242573156776378371)).

In February, the Trump campaign and the [Republican National Committee
announced](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/20/michigan-voting-lawsuits-rnc-trump-116142)
they would spend $10 million on litigation and election monitoring in
the 2020 cycle. Soon after, legal attacks on expanding vote-by-mail
began. In March, [the Republican Party in New Mexico
sued](https://www.krwg.org/post/new-mexico-republicans-file-lawsuit-have-supreme-court-block-mail-primary)
to prevent 27 county clerks from shifting to vote-by-mail for the June
primary. In April, three voters affiliated with the conservative group
[True the Vote filed a lawsuit to stop
Nevada](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/another-lawsuit-filed-against-planned-mail-only-primary-election-by-conservative-voting-monitoring-group)
from conducting an all-mail primary election planned by the secretary of
state. ([A federal court rejected the suit at the end of the
month](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/order.pdf),
calling its claim of voter fraud “without any factual basis.”) In Texas,
[Attorney General Ken Paxton interpreted the state
law](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/4.14.20%20Letter%20to%20Rep.%20Klick.pdf)
that requires an excuse like illness for absentee voting to mean that a
voter must actually be sick rather than simply be concerned about
becoming infected. Paxton threatened “criminal sanctions” for anyone
advising voters to apply for a mail-in ballot based “solely on fear of
contracting Covid-19.” When a state judge ruled in April that all Texas
registered voters could qualify for an absentee ballot because of the
pandemic, Paxton appealed the ruling, leaving the matter in limbo.

Before the coronavirus, the 2020 election was already vulnerable to
disinformation campaigns, foreign interference and the country’s
increasing polarization. The pandemic creates other challenges. In a
nightmare scenario, officials could use the virus as an excuse to shut
the polls selectively, to the benefit of their party. Or state
legislatures could invoke the power the Constitution gives them to
choose the electors who cast votes in the Electoral College, and thus
actually select the president. (The states turned this power over to the
voters in the 19th century, but they could try to take it back.) Any
move like that would surely land in the Supreme Court, which has its own
deepening groove of ideological division — and the dubious history of
Bush v. Gore, the case in which the court intervened to effectively
decide the outcome of the 2000 election.

With six months to go until the election (the date, the Tuesday after
the first Monday in November, [is set by an 1845
law](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/28th-congress/session-2/c28s2ch1.pdf),
and both houses of Congress would have to agree to change it) the
chances of a breakdown in its administration seem high. And this is a
year when accusations of a stolen or broken election have more potential
than they’ve had for decades to rip the country apart. It’s hard to
overstate the importance of seeing the election done right. “It’s this
simple: A disputed election in this environment poses an existential
threat to American democracy,” Persily says. “It is that serious.”

**Wisconsin shows how** politically divisive basic access to voting
could be in November. Three other swing states — Michi­gan, Pennsylvania
and North Carolina — have the same kind of divided government, with
Democratic governors and Republican-led legislatures wrestling for
control, the dynamic that caused so much trouble in April. Wisconsin,
Michigan and Pennsylvania also have major cities (Milwaukee, Detroit and
Philadelphia) where African-Americans could play a decisive role in the
election and have also suffered disproportionate Covid-19 infections and
deaths. The combination could especially imperil their constitutional
right to
vote.

The cities and counties of Wisconsin are learning from their experience
in April. State officials can advise them on preparing for the pandemic,
but it’s the local clerks and commissioners who have to make the
logistics work. In Milwaukee, the City Council responded to the chaos
and disenfranchisement by passing a resolution asking Albrecht, the
election director, to send Milwaukee’s 300,000 registered voters an
application for a mail-in ballot for November. Albrecht told me he would
spend the summer overhauling operations. “I’m talking about all of it,”
he said. He has submitted a request to the Postal Service for an
investigation. Many Milwaukee voters who applied for absentee ballots on
two particular dates, March 22 and 23, did not receive them. “Our
forensic review shows we responded and sent them out,” Albrecht said.
“Did the post office mess up? We don’t know.” Albrecht is also making
sure he has the supplies of paper for added ballots and envelopes that
he needs. Finally, Albrecht said, he is concentrating on voter
education. People who were accustomed to going to the polls made
mistakes, like dropping ballots through the book-drop slot at the
library without the certified envelope, which disqualified their votes.

In Pennsylvania, the presidential primary scheduled for June 2 will be
the first test of whether large numbers of people can successfully vote
by mail. [The Legislature last year passed a
law](https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/sweeping-changes-to-pennsylvania-election-law-could-make-early-voting-a-norm/)
that provides for absentee ballots for anyone who requests it without
requiring an excuse. “We’ve had 160,000 applications for mail-in ballots
for the primary in the last week,” Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy
Boockvar said when I spoke to her in mid-April. “For comparison, in
2016, we got 19,000 in the same period.” She stressed that federal
funding would be crucial for preparing for November. In the long run,
voting by mail can be less expensive. Counties that adopted it in
Colorado, one of five states that sends ballots by mail to every
registered voter, [spent less than $10 per voter
in 2014](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2016/03/colorado-voting-reforms-early-results)compared
with about $16 per voter six years earlier. But in the present, states
need help to make the switch.

Three elected city commissioners are responsible for directing the
logistics in Philadelphia. “To be honest, everything we were planning to
do for November is on hold as we navigate through the virus,” Lisa
Deeley, one of the three commissioners and the commission’s chairwoman,
said when I called her in April. “All our focus right now is on the
primary.”

A few days later, the National Association of Presort Mailers held a
teleconference for vendors across the country that are in the niche
business of printing and packaging bulk mail, including mail-in ballots.
They specialize in details like ensuring that the paper for the ballots
and envelopes is certified so the ink printed on it will scan correctly.

On the call, [according to the news site Talking Points
Memo](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/mail-in-elections-covid-19-supply),
companies warned that they were already at capacity for November,
filling orders from longtime vote-by-mail states like California and
Colorado. They could expand, but they would need to buy costly equipment
that takes several months to obtain, a step they would only take with
orders from states and counties in hand. “For example, the machine that
folds and inserts the ballot into the envelope can cost up to $1
million,” Richard Gebbie, chief executive of Midwest Presort Mailing
Services and president of the national association, told me. “It
normally takes 90 days to order one piece of gear. Then you have to get
it installed and check everything, because the security and quality
control has to be very, very high.” Gebbie’s company has been contacting
county boards of election in the region, including in Pennsylvania, but
he says so far it has received a cool response. “I think with the Covid,
they’re not sure what they can do. We have one county in Pennsylvania,
Mercer, that said, Let’s get a quote. The others said, Call us back in a
month. The Catch-22 is: That could be too late.”

Deeley called me back later in April to assure me that Philadelphia
would be ready for the fall election but gave few specifics. “Her heart
is in the right place, but this is just a huge challenge,” says David
Thornburgh, the president and C.E.O. of the Committee of Seventy, a
good-government group in Philadelphia founded in 1904. “We are at the
house-is-burning level of alarm in some cities,” says another voting
rights advocate, who didn’t want to be identified criticizing local
election officials. As of the end of April, Philadelphia had a backlog
of almost 9,000 absentee applications waiting to be processed for the
June primary. Voting rights advocates have filed a lawsuit asking the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court to require the state to let all absentee
ballots sent or postmarked by Election Day in June and November to be
counted if they are received within seven days of each election.

In Michigan, where voters passed a 2018 referendum that allows voting by
mail without an excuse, a big increase is also expected. “We are
planning for 70 to 90 percent voting by mail in Detroit,” Secretary of
State Jocelyn Benson, who lives in the city, told me. “That means
allocating resources, ordering supplies, developing educational
materials.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For a set of local elections throughout the state in May, Benson’s
office is mailing applications for absentee ballots to all registered
voters, with return postage prepaid by the state. But Michigan doesn’t
pay return postage for voters’ ballots for either the primary or general
election. Stamps are a particular barrier for young people who have
grown up communicating digitally, elections officials say. Most other
states — including Florida and Pennsylvania — don’t pay return postage
for applications or ballots. Mailing costs and other Covid-19-related
expenses for the general election (and another election in August) would
cost Michigan $40 million, Benson estimates. The state has so far only
received $11 million for all election expenses related to the pandemic.

A coalition of more than 200 public-interest groups are pushing hard for
Congress to include $3.6 billion for the 2020 election cycle in the next
coronavirus relief bill. They also want all states to offer online and
same-day voter registration and to extend in-person early voting to
avoid crowding on Election Day. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority
leader, called the funding a top priority on an April conference call
with 20 civil rights groups. Some Republican secretaries of state, like
LaRose from Ohio, support additional funding, but don’t want the federal
government to tell them how to run their elections. Some Republican
senators continue to see the funding proposal as an effort to give
Democrats an
advantage.

In the coming months, in the swing states and elsewhere, partisan fights
could break out over whether to allow voters to request an absentee
ballot online instead of by mail (many states currently don’t allow
this), or waive the requirement that voters obtain witness signatures
before returning their ballots (as North Carolina and Wisconsin, among
others, mandate) because some voters are self-isolating during the
pandemic.

Absentee-ballot fraud, the recent focus of Republicans, has occasionally
taken place in isolated instances in states where low numbers of people
typically vote by mail. “There’s a history of tampering with absentee
ballots, mostly in pockets in Appalachia (including Kentucky), South
Texas and sometimes in cities with party machines,” says Richard Hasen,
author of the recent book “Election Meltdown” and a law and
political-science professor at the University of California, Irvine. The
most prominent modern-day case of absentee fraud occurred in rural
Bladen County, N.C., in 2018. North Carolina, like a lot of states, bars
people from collecting and turning in absentee ballots of voters outside
their family. (Other states cap the number that people can collect.)
Nonetheless, in Bladen County, after Mark Harris, a Republican candidate
for Congress, won his election by 905 votes, evidence emerged that a
political operative working for him may have collected as many as 800
absentee votes, many from African-American voters, filled some of them
in for Harris and perhaps tossed others away. The bipartisan state Board
of Elections threw out the results and ordered a new election.

States that have adopted universal vote-by-mail have shown it can be
done securely. “They have very strong track records,” Hasen says.
Election officials create a clear, unhackable paper trail for ballots,
sending them to voters with a bar code that can be tracked. Voters must
sign the ballots, which means signatures can be checked, and send them
back in a certified inner envelope, also signed and also with a bar
code. “The claim of fraud is a distraction,” Jena Griswold, the
secretary of state in Colorado, where 95 percent of people voted by mail
in 2018, told me. “We have a history of clean elections. When we think
there is the *possibility* of double voting, we send every case to the
attorney general. Our number for 2018 was 0.0027 percent.”

One big question for 2020 is how states will verify absentee ballots to
guard against fraud while also ensuring that voters are treated fairly.
Many states lack uniform criteria or training for matching the signature
on a ballot with the copy of the voter’s signature that the state has on
file. As a result, rejection rates can vary a great deal from county to
county. States including Pennsylvania and Michigan don’t require
election officials to notify voters if their signatures are missing or
have been rejected, so those voters don’t have a chance to fix the
problem. The gaps in the law leave the decision up to county and local
officials.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are certain best practices. It’s better for counties to use
databases that chart the evolution of voters’ signatures over time
rather than relying on a registration file that may be decades old. In
Washington, [which instituted universal vote-by-mail
in 2011](https://crosscut.com/2020/04/washingtons-successful-vote-mail-system-wasnt-built-overnight),
state patrol officers who investigate fraud train election workers on
evaluating signatures, according to Kim Wyman, the secretary of state.
“They teach us to look at the slant of the letters or the path of how
the signer moves the pen,” she says. “After the training, you have more
confidence that a signature can be a match even if it’s not identical.”
If a signature fails a first check, it goes through another round of
review and then to a three-member elected canvassing board, which
examines any flagged ballots in a public session. “You have to be open
and transparent about how you’re verifying, or people will think you’re
just throwing out Democratic or Republican votes to win,” Wyman says.

It’s also important to give voters clear instructions about filling out
mail-in ballots. “We had to educate the voters, and we also had graphic
designers come in and help us,” Wyman says. “A lot is in the design —
for example, putting a big red X with ‘sign here’ next to the signature
line.” The fate of thousands of ballots — and the outcome of a close
election — can depend on the choices states make. “The problem of
uniform standards can be easily overcome,” says Nathaniel Persily, the
Stanford election expert. “But if states don’t address it ahead of time,
you can imagine absentee signatures being the hanging chads of 2020.”

**Before the pandemic,** candidates rarely focused on vote-by-mail in
their campaigns. One exception is Stacey Abrams, the Democratic
candidate for governor of Georgia in 2018. Her campaign sent 1.6 million
applications for absentee ballots to registered voters who signaled they
supported her. “I think we were the first modern Democratic campaign to
run a really aggressive vote-by-mail operation,” says Lauren Groh-Wargo,
who was Abrams’s campaign manager. “It was integrated with our voter
education, our ads, our field operation. We could track the delivery of
the absentee ballots and also whether they’d been returned. We staffed a
hotline to walk people through any issues they had filling them out.”

Abrams won the absentee-ballot count by about 53,000 votes. But in the
end, her opponent, Brian Kemp, who was the Georgia secretary of state
responsible for managing elections during the race, defeated her by
close to 55,000 votes.

After the election, Abrams founded a voting rights group, Fair Fight
Action, which sued the state later that November, along with a
domestic-worker advocacy group, for suppressing the vote in several
ways. One of them involved absentee ballots. Election officials had
rejected thousands of them, often for errors like writing the date of
the election in the field for a birth date. Daniel Smith, a
political-science professor at the University of Florida, analyzed
Georgia’s absentee-ballot data as an expert for Fair Fight Action in the
lawsuit. He found a higher rate of rejection for voters of color, who
tended to support Abrams, than for white
voters.

Georgia now has a new secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a
Republican who has raised the specter of fraud by announcing an
“Absentee-Ballot Fraud Task Force” for 2020 that prosecutors will help
lead. The task force, nine of whose 12 members are Republican, would
investigate, among other things, “every signature mismatch” on a mail-in
ballot, Raffensperger said in a news conference. Groh-Wargo of Fair
Fight Action called the task force “a submission to the Trump
voter-suppression machine.” In her view, Raffensperger’s intention is
clear: Intimidate and deter voters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Republican officials have also increasingly pursued a practice that will
matter in November no matter how voters cast their ballots, because it
affects eligibility to vote by mail as well as in person — mass cuts to
the voter-registration rolls. “Purges in and of themselves aren’t bad,”
Kevin Morris and Myrna Pérez of the Brennan Center [wrote in a 2018
analysis.](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/florida-georgia-north-carolina-still-purging-voters-high-rates)
“They’re commonly used to clean up voter lists when someone has moved,
passed away and more. But too often, names identified for removal are
determined by faulty criteria that wrongly suggests a voter be deleted
from the rolls.” Purging often disproportionally shaves away black and
Latino voters.

Before she ran for governor, Abrams worked for years to register
hundreds of thousands of new voters, many of them African-American and
Latino, hoping to make Georgia (where people of color make up 40 percent
of the population) more competitive for Democrats. Between 2016 and
2018, Kemp purged more than 700,000 registered voters, more than 10
percent of the state total. Most people Kemp cut hadn’t responded to a
notice sent by the state after they didn’t vote in the last few
elections. The state presumed the voters it cut from the rolls had moved
away or died, but in 2019, [an investigation by APM
Reports](https://www.apmreports.org/story/2019/10/29/georgia-voting-registration-records-removed)
from Ameri­can Public Media estimated that at least 107,000 of them
remained eligible to vote. Like many states, Georgia does not permit
same-day registration, so people who show up to vote and find they can’t
are not simply allowed back on the rolls.

Secretary Raffensperger purged another 309,000 voters in December (and
then restored 22,000 of them, saying they were eliminated in error).
Last year, Ohio took the unusual step of releasing to advocacy groups in
advance a list of 235,000 voters it planned to purge. A watchdog group
called the [Ohio Voter Project
discovered](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/us/politics/ohio-voter-purge.html)
that about 40,000 voters were being cut in error, about half of them
from a heavily Democratic county with one of the highest percentages of
people of color in the state.

If the 2020 election is close, purges in swing states could shape the
results. [According to the Brennan
Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/florida-georgia-north-carolina-still-purging-voters-high-rates),
in the two years leading up to the 2018 election, North Carolina, which
has a Republican Legislature and at the time had a Republican governor,
purged 11.7 percent of its voters; and Florida, also a
Republican-controlled state, purged more than 7 percent, compared with
0.2 percent from 2008 to 2010. (In 2000, Florida’s wrongful purge of
thousands of voters, a disproportionate number of whom were black,
probably contributed to George W. Bush’s presidential victory, according
to the general counsel of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights at the
time, [in a 2015 article in The
Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/how-the-2000-election-in-florida-led-to-a-new-wave-of-voter-disenfranchisement/).)
In Wisconsin, a legal battle over purging voter rolls is continuing.
Concerned about errors, state election officials tried to delay cutting
234,000 voters they identified as having changed addresses until after
the November election. But a conservative group, the Wisconsin Institute
for Law and Liberty, sued to force the state to make the cuts before
voting takes place. The Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked 3 to 3 over
the case in March, with the seventh justice declining to participate
because he was the one who was running in the April election. After he
lost, he wrote that it appeared that the reason for his recusal “no
longer obtains,” signaling that he would rejoin the case, which could
then be decided before the newly elected liberal justice takes her seat
on August 1.

**On the day** of Wisconsin’s April election, photos of people lining up
at the Milwaukee polls, many of them African-American, streamed through
social media feeds and were featured in press reports. The images
reminded people that voting matters, that it’s a right so precious that
your political opponents will try to prevent you from exercising it.
Three years ago in Alabama, after a divisive Senate campaign,
African-American voters turned out for the Democratic candidate, Doug
Jones, and achieved a higher share of the vote than they did for Barack
Obama in 2008 and 2012. When Jones won, activists took pride with social
media posts like “\#BlackVotesMatter and don’t anyone tell you
different.” Regrouping with her organization in Milwaukee, Angela Lang
said she was hearing simi­lar determination. “We talked to an older
woman, in her 70s, and I think she ended up not voting, but she said, No
matter what, I’m voting in November. People can see how important it is
to have a say in how decisions are made.”

When the results were announced several days later, they showed that
encouraging voting by mail could in fact help Democrats. The liberal
State Supreme Court candidate beat her conservative opponent by a margin
of 10 percentage points more in the absentee-ballot count than at
polling places.

A conservative advocacy group, the Honest Elections Project, responded
to the Wisconsin election by spending $250,000 on an online ad that
blasted “record absentee voting.” The ad showed photos of long lines of
masked voters with the line, “It’s wrong,” and then pivoted to a
“responsible solution,” with a photo of elderly white people in a
sunny room: “Vulnerable people protected with expanded absentee voting.
Fraud, prevented.” The mixed messages illustrate the difficulty of
railing against voting-by-mail while also promoting it among the party’s
supporters.

It is possible to hold a successful and orderly election during the
pandemic. In April, South Korea recorded the highest turnout, 66
percent, for a parliamentary election in 28 years. The government’s
handling of the coronavirus — far more successful than that of the
United States in reducing deaths and infections — dominated the
political discourse. But on Election Day, people in masks calmly lined
up at the polls, moving step by step between lines of tape marking off
one-meter distances. Poll workers took their temperatures, and those
with a fever went to a separate area to vote. Voters received hand
sanitizer and disposable gloves before entering the booths. People who
were self-quarantining received a text from the government permitting
them to leave their homes for 1 hour 40 minutes to vote at 6 p.m., when
the polls were closed to everyone else. Only about 40 percent of voters
cast their ballots early or by mail.

The United States prides itself on its democracy in theory — but this
year, not necessarily in practice. What if Philadelphia runs out of
absentee ballots? What if a swing state can’t count its avalanche of
mail-in ballots on election night, and the media races to call a winner,
and then the final tabulation changes it — and then there’s a dispute
over signature-matching? The 2020 results may well be too early to call
for days. A candidate who warns now about fraud and chaos, as Trump is
ceaselessly doing, is sowing the seeds for his supporters to distrust
the results if he loses.

“You’ve heard the election administrator’s prayer, right?” Persily asked
me. “Whatever happens, dear Lord, please let it not be
close.”
