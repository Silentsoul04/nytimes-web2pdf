WASHINGTON — Despite growing evidence that the pandemic is still raging,
administration officials said on Tuesday that they had made so much
progress in bringing it under control that they planned to wind down the
[coronavirus task
force](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/politics/coronavirus-task-force-trump.html)
in the coming weeks and focus the White House on restarting the economy.

Vice President Mike Pence, who has led the task force for two months,
said it would probably wrap up its work around the end of the May, and
shift management of the public health response back to the federal
agencies whose work it was created to coordinate.

Other administration officials said that under plans still in
discussion, the White House would consult with medical experts on a more
informal basis and that Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and
senior adviser, would help oversee a group pushing for progress in
developing a vaccine and treatments for the virus.

“It really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as
a country,” Mr. Pence told reporters at the White House.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

His comments came a day after the revelation of new estimates that
suggest deaths from the coronavirus, now above 70,000, [could double by
early August](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america),
and that infection rates may rise sharply as businesses reopen. While
the number of new cases logged daily in the New York City area is
declining, [new cases continue to
grow](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-cases-united-states.html)
across the rest of the United States.

With President Trump facing a tough re-election battle, the White House
appears intent on putting a response to the daily death toll more toward
the background as it emphasizes efforts at a return to economic and job
growth. The president’s advisers have repeatedly tried to place the
responsibility for testing and decisions about reopening on individual
states.

The task force spent some of its time preparing talking points for Mr.
Trump, who took over its public briefings, often turning them into
lengthy opportunities to air grievances, praise his own handling of the
crisis and offer up his own
prescriptions.

There were signals in recent days of the task force’s impending demise:
The panel did not meet on Saturday, as it typically does, and canceled a
meeting on Monday. And the president has stopped linking his news
briefings to the task force’s meetings and no longer routinely arrays
task force members around him in his public appearances, a change that
came swiftly after he mused one day about [the possibility of injecting
disinfectants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html)
to kill the virus.

Members of the coronavirus task force, including Dr. Deborah L. Birx,
the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, had to urge
Americans not to take those steps. And they often served as a public
check on Mr. Trump’s questionable or false statements, cautioning about
promises of a quick vaccine or [the effectiveness of
hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/05/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html),
a drug [promoted by the
president](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/business/media/virus-fox-news-hydroxychloroquine.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the task force’s advice has sometimes been swept aside by Mr.
Trump and the guidelines it produced for states to reopen ignored by
some of them, the group was a comforting symbol for people scared about
the virus’s spread and looking for a sign the White House was taking it
seriously. People closely monitored which members attended, noting any
time Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a leading infectious disease expert, was
absent. The decision to phase out the task force has prompted new
questions about whether the administration will be adequately organized
to address the complex, life-or-death decisions related to the virus and
give sufficient voice to scientists and public health experts in making
policy.

“We will have something in a different form,” Mr. Trump told reporters
on Tuesday during a trip to Arizona.

Asked why now was the right time to wind down the task force, he
replied, “Because we can’t keep our country closed for the next five
years.”

If there is a recurrence of cases in the fall, he said, “we’re going to
put the flame out.”

White House officials said that medical officials like Dr. Birx would
still be advising the president and be available to answer reporters’
questions.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Still, the change means a growing role for Mr. Kushner, who is looking
for a czarlike appointee to oversee the development of a vaccine and
therapeutic treatments, as well as for top economic officials like
Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and the White House advisers
Larry Kudlow and Kevin Hassett.

Since it was formed in January, the task force has been the scene of
bureaucratic and policy battling, its influence only as great as Mr.
Trump’s episodic willingness to accept its advice.

Its priorities and configuration often reflected the most immediate
circumstances, starting with quarantines for passengers of cruise ships
and repatriated Americans in late January and early February. But the
group spent little time managing [the testing of Americans for the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html),
a problem the administration still has not fully resolved.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was initially overseen by Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health
and human services, before he was [cast aside for Mr.
Pence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html).
Its influence peaked in March, when Dr. Birx led other members in
persuading the president to urge the stay-at-home and social-distancing
orders that have averted even higher death tolls, but at a huge cost to
the
economy.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may

From the task force’s inception, there have been tensions between
economic advisers and some of Mr. Trump’s health and national security
officials over the right balance between keeping the nation locked down
to minimize illness and death and the devastation from a [historic surge
in
joblessness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html).

In recent weeks, one official said, economic advisers, including Mr.
Mnuchin, have had an increasingly prominent role in discussions of
public health matters. To critics, Mr. Trump’s promotion of economic
recovery reflects the White House’s impatience with the caution that top
health officials have urged for months as the virus’s death toll has
climbed rapidly.

At the same time, top White House officials have moved much of the
coordination of federal resources away from the official task force. A
group led by Mr. Kushner has been functioning as something of a shadow
task force since early March. Among other issues, Mr. Kushner has told
people he is helping oversee the vaccine development process, and he has
been overseeing the expansion of testing.

“The task force has been hampered by inconsistent messaging,” said Dr.
Joshua M. Sharfstein, a former top F.D.A. official who [teaches on

at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “There were too
many times when what the scientists said and what the president said
were at odds.”

At various moments, different splinter groups separate from the task
force have met elsewhere in the White House, including the one led by
Mr. Kushner, which focused on testing and then supplies of personal
protective equipment and ventilators. Another has been led by Joe
Grogan, the chief of the White House Domestic Policy Council who plans
to leave his post this month.

That group, composed mostly of top health officials, gathers in the West
Wing’s Roosevelt Room to organize and script discussion for the larger
task force meeting that occurs directly after it, one senior
administration official said. Another group, which consists solely of
top health officials with medical degrees, meets less regularly in
person and by phone.

The news of the task force’s potential disbandment was not met with
strong resistance from medical officials in the group, according to
senior administration officials. In recent months, top health officials
had become wary of the amount of time task force obligations were
taking, including trips to and from the White House, which is far from
the headquarters of agencies such as the National Institutes of Health,
where a task force meeting was scheduled to take place on Tuesday before
it was moved to the White House, one official said.

Dr. Fauci described the meetings last week as the place where health
officials could spend 90 minutes or so examining data about new
infections and deaths, the effectiveness of potential treatments and the
surging of resources to new hot spots.

“Everyone understands the task force and refers to it as the
coordinating body, where policies came out, messaging came out,
guidelines were centralized from this one body,” said Dr. Leana S. Wen,
an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington
University. “We need to have a national coordinating body that has the
ear of the president and is able to direct the entire federal
government.”

Noah Weiland and David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Maggie
Haberman from New York.
