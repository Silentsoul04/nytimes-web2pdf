\section{New York Must Hold Democratic Presidential Primary, Judge
Rules}\label{new-york-must-hold-democratic-presidential-primary-judge-rules}}

The primary in June, which had been canceled over concerns about the
coronavirus, should still be held, with all qualifying candidates
restored to the ballot, a federal judge ruled.

A federal judge on Tuesday ordered elections officials in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/nyregion/ny-primary-2020.html}{New
York State to hold its Democratic primary election in June} and
reinstate all qualifying candidates on the ballot. The ruling came after
the presidential primary was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/us/politics/democratic-primary-canceled-coronavirus.html}{canceled
late last month} over concerns about the coronavirus.

The order, filed by Judge Analisa Torres of United States District
Court, came in response to a lawsuit filed last week by the former
Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. He sought to undo the New
York State Board of Elections' decision in late April to cancel the June
23 contest, a move it attributed to health and safety worries and the
fact that the results would not change the primary's outcome.

On Tuesday night, Douglas A. Kellner, a co-chair of the New York Board
of Elections, said the board was ``reviewing the decision and preparing
an appeal.'' And speaking on CNN, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the
presidential primary would proceed per the court's ruling at least for
the time being, but he noted the potential for an appeal.

Mr. Yang said in
\href{https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1257826412851011584}{a
statement on Twitter} that he was ``glad that a federal judge agreed
that depriving millions of New Yorkers of the right to vote was wrong,''
and he urged state elections officials to safeguard democracy.

The initial move to cancel the presidential primary drew a backlash from
the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, whose decision to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/us/politics/bernie-sanders-drops-out.html}{suspend
his campaign in April} made former Vice President
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.} the presumptive Democratic nominee.

And it sowed confusion around the state; though the statewide
presidential primary was canceled, dozens of local elections were not,
leaving some candidates and political operatives nervous that voters
might presume the entire primary had been called off.

Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement on
Tuesday: ``We're glad Judge Torres has restored basic democracy in New
York. People in every state should have the right to express their
preference in the 2020 Democratic primary. We have confidence that New
York can hold elections in June in a safe manner that preserves New
Yorkers' right to vote.''

In his lawsuit, Mr. Yang and a group of his delegates contended that
their rights had been violated when their names were removed from the
presidential primary ballot and the primary was canceled. In her ruling,
the judge found this to be true, and said Mr. Yang and other candidates
whose names were purged from the ballot had shown that they had been
caused ``irreparable injury.''

Neither Mr. Yang nor Mr. Sanders had ``taken formal action'' to remove
himself from the ballot, the judge added. And although she acknowledged
that protecting the public from the spread of the virus was ``an
important state interest,'' she wrote that ``the Court is not convinced
that canceling the presidential primary would meaningfully advance that
interest --- at least not to the degree as would justify the burdensome
impingement'' on the plaintiffs' rights.

Even though he suspended his campaign, Mr. Sanders had repeatedly
pleaded for his supporters to vote for him, arguing that the more
delegates he could amass, the greater leverage he would have over policy
discussions with Mr. Biden and the Democratic platform.

But progressives around New York also sounded the alarm that canceling
the presidential primary could have an outsize impact on their turnout.
The presence of Mr. Sanders, a galvanizing force for progressives around
the country, on top of the ticket was likely to drive more turnout for
down-ballot races, they said.

Jeff Weaver, who served as a senior adviser on the Sanders campaign,
said he was ``overjoyed'' at the judge's decision and said the Sanders
legal team had coordinated with Mr. Yang's legal team.

``These primaries are not just for nominating a candidate for president,
but they are also for electing delegates who are going to decide the
platform of the party, who are going to decide the rules of the party,''
Mr. Weaver said. He pointed to Mr. Sanders's 2016 delegates as essential
to the party's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/25/us/politics/superdelegates-democrats-dnc.html}{overhaul
of its superdelegate system} as an example.

He also called for the State Legislature in New York to meet and pass a
new law vastly expanding vote-by-mail, and to use the primary as a
``testing ground for an all-vote-by-mail system in New York State.''

Though the initial decision was made by the independent Board of
Elections, and Mr. Cuomo did not directly weigh in during deliberations,
liberal groups like Our Revolution, a Sanders-aligned outside group, saw
the invisible hand of the governor. Absent the reversal, Larry Cohen,
the chair of Our Revolution, had vowed to wage a floor fight at the
Democratic National Convention.

``Andrew Cuomo did his best to deny Sanders and other delegates the
right to represent their party as the party rules require,'' Mr. Cohen
said. ``Congratulations Andrew Yang for standing with us and winning for
all of us. Vote-by-mail is the answer to the pandemic, not voter
suppression.''

Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the New York State Democratic Party, said he
still believed it was a ``mistake'' to hold a statewide presidential
primary, but said it was out of the state party's control.

``It was not in our hands in the first place, it's not in our hands
now,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ``I supported the position that stood for the
health and safety of poll workers and voters.''
