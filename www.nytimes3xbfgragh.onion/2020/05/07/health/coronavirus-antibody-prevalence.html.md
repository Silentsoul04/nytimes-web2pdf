A new study offers a glimmer of hope in the grim fight against the
coronavirus: Nearly everyone who has had the disease — regardless of
age, sex or severity of illness — [makes antibodies to the
virus](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085613v1).

The study, posted online on Tuesday but not yet reviewed by experts,
also hints that anyone who has [recovered from
infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/nyregion/coronavirus-recovery-hospital.html)
may safely return to work — although it is unclear how long their
protection might last.

“This is very good news,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at
Columbia University in New York who was not involved with the
work.

[Antibodies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-antibody-testing.html)
are immune molecules produced by the body to fight pathogens. The
presence of antibodies in the blood typically confers at least some
protection against the invader.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Health officials in several countries, including the United States, have
hung their hopes on tests that identify coronavirus antibodies to decide
who is immune and can go back to work. People who are immune could
replace vulnerable individuals, especially in high-transmission settings
like hospitals, building what researchers call [“shield immunity” in the
population](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0895-3).

But most antibody tests are [fraught with false
positives](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/health/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html)
— picking up antibody signals where there are none. The new study relied
on a test developed by Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai, that has a less than 1 percent chance of
producing false-positive results.

Several small studies have given reason to hope that people who have had
Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, would gain some
immunity for some period of time. The new study is the largest by far,
with results from 1,343 people in and around New York City.

The study also eased a niggling worry that only some people — only those
who were severely ill, for example — might make antibodies. In fact, the
level of antibodies did not differ by age or sex, and even people who
had only mild symptoms produced a healthy amount.

Having antibodies is not the same as having immunity to the virus. But
in previous research, Dr. Krammer’s team has
[shown](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v2)
that antibody levels are closely linked with the ability to disarm the
virus, the key to immunity.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It really shows that most people do develop antibodies, and that
there’s very good correlation between those antibodies and their
capability to neutralize virus,” Dr. Rasmussen
said.

Researchers at Mount Sinai tested people who signed up to be [donors of
convalescent
plasma](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/health/plasma-coronavirus-treatment.html),
antibodies extracted from blood. The project has enrolled more than
15,000 people so far, according to Dr. Ania Wajnberg, who is leading the
effort.

The new study is an analysis of results of the first set of donors. Over
all, only 3 percent of these participants had been seen in the emergency
department or had been hospitalized. The remaining subjects had only
mild or moderate symptoms.

“To my knowledge, this is the largest group of people described with
mild disease,” Dr. Wajnberg said.

The criteria for inclusion became more stringent as the team learned
more about the coronavirus. For example, they initially required the
potential donors to be free of symptoms for only three days but later
extended that to 14 days.

The team tested 624 people who had tested positive for the virus and had
recovered. At first, just 511 of them had high antibody levels; 42 had
low levels; and 71 had none. When 64 of the subjects with weak or no
levels were retested more than a week later, however, all but three had
at least some antibodies.

That suggests the timing of testing for antibodies can greatly affect
the results, the researchers said. “We weren’t looking exactly at this,
but we had enough to say that 14 days is probably a little too early,”
Dr. Wajnberg said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There was even a difference between levels at 20 days versus 24 days,
she said, suggesting that the optimal time for an antibody test is well
after symptoms begin. “What we’re telling people now is at least three
weeks after symptom onset,” Dr. Wajnberg said.

Because tests to diagnose coronavirus infection were unavailable to most
people in New York City in March, the researchers included another 719
people in their study who suspected they had Covid-19 based on symptoms
and exposure to the virus, but in whom the illness had not been
diagnosed.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

In this group, the researchers found a different picture altogether. The
majority of these people — 62 percent — did not seem to have antibodies.

Some of them may have been tested too soon after their illness for
antibodies to be detectable. But many probably mistook influenza,
another viral infection or even allergies for Covid-19, Dr. Wajnberg
said.

“I think literally everybody in New York thinks they’ve had it,” she
said. “People shouldn’t assume the fever they had in January was Covid
and they’re immune.”

Other experts were more struck by the percentage of people who turned
out to have antibodies, even though the coronavirus had never been
diagnosed in them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The number suggests that “in cities like New York, there are a
tremendous number of undiagnosed infections,” said Taia Wang, a viral
immunologist at Stanford University.

An antibody survey conducted by New York State officials found that 20
percent of city residents had been
infected.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Another finding from the study — that diagnostic PCR tests can be
positive up to 28 days after the start of infection — is also important,
Dr. Wang said. These tests look for genetic fragments, not antibodies,
and suggest an active or waning infection.

“As far as known unknowns about SARS-CoV-2, this one really stands out,”
she said. “We really need to know, how long does it take the body to
clear the virus? How long are people contagious? We don’t know the
answer to that.”

She and other scientists said it was highly unlikely that a positive
test so long after symptoms appeared represents infectious virus.
Researchers in South Korea recently announced, for example, that several
suspected cases of “reinfection” were a result of PCR tests picking up
[remnants of dead
virus](https://www.newsweek.com/south-korea-experts-say-recovered-coronavirus-patients-retested-positive-because-dead-virus-parts-1500998).

Genetic material from the measles virus can show up in tests six months
after the illness, Dr. Krammer noted. And genetic fragments of Ebola and
Zika viruses are known to persist even longer in the body.

Still, Dr. Wang said, “Until we do know, it’s prudent for everyone to
proceed as if a positive PCR test means contagious virus.” The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people isolate for 10
days after the onset of symptoms, but that period may need to be longer.

Experts said the next step would be to confirm that the presence of
antibodies in the blood means protection from the coronavirus. The body
depends on a subset of antibodies, called neutralizing antibodies, to
shield it from the coronavirus.

“The question now becomes to what extent those are neutralizing
antibodies and whether that leads to protection from infection — all of
which we should presume are yes,” said Sean Whelan, a virologist at
Washington University in St. Louis.

In Dr. Krammer’s previous work, to be published in the journal Nature
Medicine, his team tested whether the antibodies have neutralizing
power. The researchers found that in about a dozen people, including
some who had mild symptoms, the level of antibodies in the blood
corresponded to the level of neutralizing activity.

So everyone who makes antibodies is likely to have some immunity to the
virus, Dr. Krammer said: “I’m fairly confident about this.” Another way
to assess immunity would be to show that purified antibodies can prevent
coronavirus infection in an animal.

But perhaps the most urgent question, especially as [research on
vaccines ramps
up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/us/politics/vaccines-coronavirus-research.html),
is how long that immunity might last.

Even if the levels of antibodies fall over time to undetectable levels,
people may still retain some protection from the coronavirus.

Immune cells called T cells are valuable soldiers in fighting pathogens,
and at least [one study has
shown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320301813)
that the coronavirus provokes a strong response from these cells.
So-called memory cells, or B cells, may also kick into gear when they
encounter the coronavirus, churning out more antibodies.

Ultimately, however, the answer to how long immunity lasts will come
only with patience.

“Unless someone has come up with some way to speed that process up,” Dr.
Rasmussen said, “the only way to tell that is by following these
patients over time.”
