If confirmed, it would be the first known death in New York related to
the mysterious inflammation that recently began appearing in children.

A child died in a Manhattan hospital on Thursday from what appeared to
be a rare syndrome linked to the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/health/coronavirus-children-kawasaki-pmis.html}{coronavirus}
that causes life-threatening inflammation in critical organs and blood
vessels of children, the hospital said.

If confirmed, it would be the first known death in New York related to
the mysterious new syndrome, which officials said
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/nyregion/kawasaki-disease-coronavirus.html}{began
to appear in recent weeks}.

The Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital, where the child was being
treated, did not release any further information about the victim.

``While it is concerning that children are affected, we must emphasize
that based on what we know thus far, it appears to be a very rare
condition,'' said Lucia Lee, a spokeswoman for the Mount Sinai Health
System.

On Friday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that the child was 5 years old and
the death --- possibly from the syndrome --- was under investigation.

The governor also said there had been 73 reported cases of children in
New York area who had been afflicted with the illness, which doctors
have labeled ``pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.'' He said
the state's Department of Health was investigating other deaths as
possible cases.

``This would be really painful news and would open up an entirely
different chapter,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ``because I can't tell you how many
people I spoke to who took peace and solace in the fact that children
were not getting infected.''

In an advisory to health care providers, state health officials said
most of the children who were thought to have the syndrome had also
tested positive for the coronavirus or for antibodies to it.

On Monday night, the New York City Department of Health
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/alert/2020/covid-19-pediatric-multi-system-inflammatory-syndrome.pdf}{issued
a bulletin}, asking doctors to report any cases of the syndrome. The
bulletin said health authorities in the city knew of 15 such cases
involving patients ages 2 to 15, who had been in intensive care units
since April 17.

The symptoms, which have been seen in a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/health/kawasaki-disease-covid-coronavirus-children.html}{growing
number} of children, appear to target the heart and coronary arteries of
children infected with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Doctors say the illness can send children into a kind of toxic shock, as
blood pressure plummets and the heart fails to send enough blood to
vital organs.

The symptoms bear some resemblance to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/health/coronavirus-children-kawasaki-pmis.html}{Kawasaki
syndrome}, a separate disease that can cause sudden inflammation of the
heart and cause coronary blockages in children.

Doctors say the inflammatory condition does not seem to be driven by
Covid-19's attack of the lungs, a hallmark of the coronavirus infection
in adults. Instead, in children who present with the syndrome, the virus
appears to be attacking the heart.

On Friday, Gov. Philip Murphy announced the first death of a child in
New Jersey from Covid-19. The child, who was four years old, had
underlying health conditions, officials said. It is unclear if the child
had the inflammatory syndrome.

The number of children in the United States showing signs of the
syndrome, which was first
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/04/28/world/europe/ap-eu-virus-outbreak-kids-rare-syndrome.html}{detected
in Europe} last month, is still small, although no solid data yet exists
on the exact number of cases.

One other death related to the syndrome has been reported, that of a
14-year-old boy in England, according to
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/article/s0140-6736(20)31094-1}{a
study published in the journal Lancet} on Wednesday.

Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany.
