Months into collective efforts to [flatten the
curve](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html),
those of us lucky enough to be [working
remotely](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/10/technology/working-from-home.html)
may be feeling overly familiar with our own homes, rooms once traveled
through quite casually on our way to somewhere else and that must now
function as our entire world. Inevitably, they fall short, and we start
to imagine ourselves — worry-free — in different, better versions. [Zoom
calls](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/technology/zoom-security.html)
and Instagram Live clips taunt us with small slivers of alternatives —
intimacy has, in so many ways, been curtailed, and yet we’re getting
glimpses into spaces we’ve never seen before. Perhaps you, too, have
been distracted by the poster, stack of books or unusually colored wall
behind the person on the other end of the platform and wondered about
what is just out of view and what it might reveal about its owner’s true
essence.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To satisfy that voyeuristic impulse, we recommend browsing some of the
most eclectic homes featured in T. These spaces are imbued not simply
with good taste (which over time can become stale) but with a point of
view, and therefore really do seem like worlds unto themselves. Take the
immaculately preserved Corona, Queens,
[abode](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/20/t-magazine/louis-armstrong-home-queens.html)
of the musician Louis Armstrong (with its mirrored bathroom and
space-age-inspired kitchen), a [surrealist
house](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/05/t-magazine/portland-house-allie-furlotti-osmose-design.html)
in Portland with LED lights lining the staircase or an erotic film
studio turned [California dream
house](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/14/t-magazine/los-angeles-dream-house-flamingo-estate.html).
Each one is its own sort of sanctuary, and a virtual tour or two is sure
to get you, however briefly, out of your house and head.

In 2005, the creative director Simon Lince and the artist Cary Leibowitz
(who sometimes works under the memorable sobriquet Candy Ass) purchased
a [farmhouse in
Ghent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/23/t-magazine/columbia-county-gay-utopia-new-york.html),
in upstate New York. Its main purpose was to act as a weekend retreat
(Leibowitz owns a [no less distinctive

in Harlem), but it’s also an effective warehouse for their sprawling
collection of antiques and art objects — including a marquee of aluminum
letters spelling out “Linceowitz,” a combination of their two names,
below which, in 2016, the couple married.

Nearly 50 years after Louis Armstrong’s death, his Corona, Queens, home
— now the site of the [Louis Armstrong House
Museum](https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/) — remains remarkably well
preserved, right down to the half-full bottle of Jack Daniel’s that
remains in his liquor cabinet. As a result, it’s not only a stunning
tribute to the musician (housing an archive of his books and his array
of trumpets) but also to the influence of midcentury design.

After purchasing three contiguous apartments on the 14th floor of a
prewar Greenwich Village apartment building, the designer [Isaac
Mizrahi](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/isaac-mizrahi)
set about connecting them, creating a roomy, art-filled nest where he
can, he says, “adjust knickknacks” and “watch ‘Jeopardy\!’ on DVR” — his
favorite pastime. The views of Lower Manhattan are pretty nice, too.

Home and work blend seamlessly together within the lighting designer and
sculptor Adam Wallacavage’s Philadelphia brownstone: The same year that
he purchased the three-story house, in 2000, he made his first octopus
chandelier, on a whim, for his Jules Verne-themed living room. The piece
— and subsequent iterations of it, many of which adorn other rooms in
the house — quickly became a signature of his practice. Throughout,
taxidermy and Art Nouveau details abound, but the sea remains a
preoccupation: As Wallacavage says, “You never know what could wash up.”

In a tidy, polite neighborhood in Portland, Ore., the home of the
comedian and philanthropist Allie Furlotti and the multimedia artist
Adam Kostiv is, Nick Marino writes, “a Trojan horse of subversive
design.” From the exterior, it’s unobtrusive; inside, though, it’s lined
with unexpected materials (labradorite — “Carrara marble gone goth” —
and vinyl) and dotted with surrealist details, a result of a thoughtful,
offbeat redesign by Andee Hess of [Osmose
Design](http://www.osmosedesign.com/).

The furniture designer [Guillermo
Santomà](http://guillermosantoma.com/)’s Casa Horta in Barcelona is
another house that plays tricks on the visitor: What at first appears to
be a modest single-story home actually comprises three stories, with
rooms that seem to melt into one another thanks to shared color schemes,
holes in walls and grated floors that light shines through. The bones of
the house date back to the early 1900s, but after purchasing it roughly
six years ago, Santomà and a small crew started remodeling, which, for
the most part, meant tearing down existing walls and creating space. In
a way, the result is an extension of his design practice: “That it
grows, that it connects, that it gets mixed up,” he says, “you don’t
quite know where one thing ends and another begins.”

years following his graduation from the University of Tokyo doing, well,
nothing. During that period, [Nikil
Saval](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/nikil-saval) writes, he
honed “his idea of what architecture ought to be.” And it proved
fruitful: He has since gone on to render that idea — interrogating sets
of oppositions like city and nature, inside and outside, isolation and
exposure — in a series of clever, conceptual buildings and residences.
The architect’s work, in Tokyo and beyond, stands out for its “perfect
fusion of conceptual daring and architectural
function.”
