One balmy winter afternoon, Andy Beckstoffer, a grape grower who has
done more than nearly anyone to shape the premium U.S. wine industry,
was sitting in Mustard’s, a restaurant in Napa Valley that is a kind of
clubhouse for the vintner class. Although Beckstoffer Vineyards, the
largest private grower in California, had recently set a sales record
with a blockbuster harvest of $55 million worth of cabernet sauvignon,
its founder was not in the mood to celebrate. The wine industry was in
trouble, facing its worst outlook in generations — and that was before
the coronavirus struck.

The litany of plagues was merciless: too many grapes, thanks to an epic
haul in California and Washington. Too many wildfires and weird bugs
unleashed by [climate
change](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/10/14/dining/drinks/climate-change-wine.html).
Too many new wineries in Napa, upsetting the balance of agriculture and
hospitality. And then there were the millennials, or millenniums, as the
80-year-old Mr. Beckstoffer likes to call them.

The generation born between 1981 and 1996 has been blamed for killing
everything from napkins to homeownership, and thanks to its passion for
hard seltzer, liquid marijuana and other drinkable novelties, it’s been
cast as the [murder
hornet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html)
of the wine industry as well. Mr. Beckstoffer finds their health-crazed
rituals (Drynuary?) puzzling.

“Wine is plant-based,” he said, shaking his head and picking mirthlessly
at a spinach and mushroom burger. “Why don’t the millenniums drink it?”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A few weeks later, Mr. Beckstoffer’s anxiety was borne out by the
publication of Silicon Valley Bank’s [annual
report](https://www.svb.com/wine-report) on the U.S. wine industry —
probably the most influential analysis of its kind. For years, its
author, Rob McMillan, has preached about the alarming convergence of two
trends: higher and higher bottle prices at the premium end of the
market, and millennial indifference. Some farmers and winemakers have
brushed Mr. McMillan off, and this time, he amped up the urgency,
writing plainly: “The issue of greatest concern for the wine business
today is the lack of participation in the premium wine category by the
large millennial generation.”

The people who make wine don’t just age grape juice, they ripen
customers, too, helping them evolve from undergraduate jug-swillers into
middle-aged buyers of prestige labels. That process, Mr. McMillan says,
appears to have stalled. Even as their purchases of other luxury goods
have increased, millennials have balked at high-priced cabernets, which
combined with the coronavirus makes 2020 “the worst time since
Prohibition for fine wine producers in the United States,” he said in an
interview.

The home of fine American wine is Napa Valley, where few benefit more
from high prices than Mr. Beckstoffer. The region has unquestionably the
best terroir in the United States, and within it, the choicest land has
his name on a billboard next to it. Starting in the 1980s, Mr.
Beckstoffer began seeking out what he calls “the good stuff” — the
vineyards with records of success going back a century or longer. He now
owns six, including To Kalon, a plot in the center of the valley
considered the crown jewel of American viticulture. For the privilege of
squeezing Beckstoffer grapes, winemakers behind labels like Stag’s Leap,
Schrader and Realm pay up to $25,000 per ton — more than five times the
Napa average.

All of which is to say: If the $71 billion California wine industry
topples, then Mr. Beckstoffer, who values his empire at $500 million,
may have the farthest to fall.

## From Navy Grog to an American ‘First Growth’

Most Napa farmers hold some of their grapes back from market, in order
to press them into wine themselves. Not Mr. Beckstoffer, who sells every
last orb of fruit he can.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“Andy’s different — he has no interest in making wine,” said Curtis
Strohl, the general manager of B Cellars, a Napa winery. In fact, Mr.
Beckstoffer finds the vinifying process a bore, and he doesn’t care
about drinking great vintages himself. His rivals in Napa say he cares
only about money. Mr. Beckstoffer says he cares about farmers and the
land. But it seems clear that over the course of his 50-year career, as
the valley transformed from a drowsy agricultural community into an
inland yacht club, the two motivations have worked in
concert.

Mr. Beckstoffer — a courtly native of Richmond, Va., who pronounces
vineyard “vin-yuhd” and “wine” as if it had three syllables — readily
concedes that what brought him to Napa was the chance to make a killing.
In 1967, recently graduated from Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, he
was working for Heublein, an East Coast food and beverage conglomerate
with products such as Smirnoff, Jose Cuervo and a pre-mixed tiki drink
called Navy Grog.

The American palate was developing an appreciation for “quality wine.”
That year, for the first time, more dry wine was sold than sweet. Mr.
Beckstoffer helped Heublein acquire Inglenook, a cherished, family-owned
winery that soon began pumping out “oceans of plonk,” as the novelist
and wine critic Jay McInerney once wrote. Heublein also bought Beaulieu,
where a similar transformation occurred.

“The arrogance,” Mr. Beckstoffer said. “We bought the two best wineries
in the valley and screwed it up.” Though still in operation, neither has
returned to glory. Looking back “makes your heart hurt,” he said.

Heublein’s bet swiftly turned sour. Spooked by labor issues, the company
gave up on quality wine after a few years and started selling its Napa
farmland — to Mr. Beckstoffer, who had resigned from the company and
moved his family to the valley. By the 1980s, he had developed an
ambitious agenda that would take decades to unfold.

Like Robert Mondavi and a few others, Mr. Beckstoffer came to believe
that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity lay dormant in Napa’s soil. For
more than a century, the potential of the valley’s wine had been
recognized even by Europeans. But the quality was uneven and financial
acumen was lacking, and as Mr. Beckstoffer saw it, the chance to create
an American equivalent of the First Growths of France was being
squandered — like a great but unknown painter in need of a sharp-elbowed
dealer.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The farmers were good at farming, but bad businessmen,” Mr. Beckstoffer
said. “You couldn’t make any money owning land and selling grapes.” He
believed that the local wine would only reach its potential if it was
strategically elevated into a luxury product — scarce, expensive,
vigilantly branded — even if that meant leaving behind an Arcadian era
centered on small family farms and affordability.

“In every agricultural area, there is a citizen hierarchy,” Mr.
Beckstoffer said. “Here, winemakers are at the top, and farmers used to
be at the bottom.” He once told an interviewer that his overriding goal
was to give grape growers more clout.

With his Ivy League M.B.A. and corporate pedigree, Mr. Beckstoffer is
not exactly a typical farmer. In the 1980s, when Napa was still oriented
toward relatively humble varietals like zinfandel, an epidemic of
phylloxera — a rapacious insect that feeds on the roots and leaves of
grape vines — wiped out crops. Mr. Beckstoffer and others led the charge
for a valley-wide replanting with the more glamorous cabernet, while
introducing data analysis and other elements of industrial farming that
magnified yields enormously.

He also wielded back-room political skills to outmaneuver opponents.
Like any good luxury item, Napa land is in short supply — 300 square
miles, most of it owned by a few families and corporations. The question
of whether to farm it, preserve it or use it to attract tourists is
never far from any conversation. In 1990, as wine drinkers were
developing a voracious appetite for Napa cabs at seemingly any price,
Mr. Beckstoffer was the driving force behind a landmark piece of
legislation, the Winery Definition Ordinance, requiring any wine with
the word “Napa” on it to be made from 75 percent local grapes.

The statute also limited what sort of social and commercial activities,
such as weddings, could take place at wineries. A generation later,
vintners still complain that the bill funneled business to its champion
and crippled the rest of the
valley.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As Mr. Beckstoffer became a land baron among land barons, he also
regularly enraged the winemakers at the top of Napa society, whom he
dismisses as “blenders” and “media stars.” One article from 1990
describes an incident at a country club, in which a winery owner
realizes that she has been seated near him and asks to be moved. Another
quotes a winemaker calling Mr. Beckstoffer “a real snake.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Beckstoffer displays both articles on his website. “If you’re not
making enemies,” he said, smiling innocently, “you’re just taking up
space.”

For good measure, he has also stymied real estate developers. As one of
the sightlier parts of Northern California, with its majestic oaks and
gaudy colors, Napa has some of the highest real estate prices in America
and some of its most expensive hotel rooms. But Mr. Beckstoffer has long
sought to choke off the development of Napa as a “lifestyle resort.”

Chuck Wagner, the founder of Caymus Vineyards, a prominent Napa winery,
is one of many proponents of building up the region — more wineries,
more hotels, more tourists. “People want to experience the beauty of the
valley,” he said. “Andy is against additional business.” He added, “A
lot of people believe that Andy does things for personal financial
gain.”

Mr. Beckstoffer insists he has higher principles, and despite his
corporate sheen, when he talks about securing “agriculture in
perpetuity” for Napa Valley, he has the unmistakable zeal of an
ideological convert. The heritage vineyards he bought are now in trusts
that cannot be developed or sold.

“You have to ask yourself, what do you want to leave for your children?”
he told me. “Someday, some spouse of a grandchild of mine will want to
build a hotel on one of our vineyards — and they will hate me, because
they can’t.”

## Strong-arm tactics — and customers happy to pay the price

The Dr. Crane Vineyard is not what you think of when imagining
world-class terroir. Wedged between a ready-mix concrete plant and a
grade school, it is nevertheless one of Napa’s oldest vineyards,
originally planted in the 1850s by George Belden Crane, the first grower
to transplant European viticulture to Napa. Ignore the immediate
surroundings — the drooping electrical wires and paved yards — and at
the end of a winter day, with a pink sun falling behind the Mayacamas
Mountains in the background, the rows of trellised vines look as
picturesque as any \#winecountry social media post.

“Look at the uniformity of the rocks\!” Mr. Beckstoffer said, cupping
one the size of an apple. Beckstoffer grapes are renowned for their
consistency, the result of exacting and technology-driven farming,
including heavy use of fertilizers. But most of what makes the heritage
vineyards superlative is a mystery. “People say it’s the soil, or the
climate,” Mr. Beckstoffer likes to say. “The truth is, we don’t know.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As he drove away, he gestured with the back of his hand at the valley’s
suburban sprawl — light, by California standards. “There are very few
places in the world where agriculture is the long-term, highest economic
value, best use of the land,” he said. Napa used to have many vineyards
as exceptional as Dr. Crane, he said, but now “they have a big house on
top of them.” Asked how long he intends to own the property, he said,
“Forever. Even if disease wipes it out, it will be a field.”

When he talks of Napa farming, Mr. Beckstoffer speaks loftily, invoking
paragons of American culture like skyscrapers and jazz. “You have to
have a larger cause, something bigger than money,” he said. “This place
is a national treasure. Napa Valley put American food and wine on the
map.”

Mr. Beckstoffer’s holdings here total only about 1,000 acres, or roughly
2 percent of the valley’s planted area. But thanks to his
near-stranglehold on prime vineyards like To Kalon and Dr. Crane, he can
demand almost whatever price he wants for his product. Decades ago, he
settled on a formula borrowed from Burgundy: For a ton of grapes, he
would charge 100 times the price of a bottle made with them. In other
words, if a bottle made from cabernet sauvignon grown at Dr. Crane
retails for $150, the cost of buying the fruit equals $15,000 per ton.

He also requires winemakers to put his name on their labels — in effect,
making them do his marketing for him. Some find it coercive, but Mr.
Beckstoffer compares the arrangement to the “Intel Inside” logo found on
Windows PCs.

“He’s in a position where he can do that,” said Tor Kenward, a winemaker
who makes cabernets with Beckstoffer grapes, retailing for $200 to $300.
“Some winemakers are uncomfortable with the terms, but most think it’s
worth the price.” At B Cellars, Mr. Strohl’s wine cave features a
shrine-like Beckstoffer Heritage Room. “I’ll pay the price because I
know I’ll get consistently excellent grapes, and I can make stellar
wine,” he said.

The price of Napa bottles has risen year after year to ever-more
incomprehensible heights — $1,000 for cult brands such as Screaming
Eagle and Colgin — creating a seemingly invincible aura of prestige. As
Mr. Beckstoffer likes to say: “You put ‘Napa Valley’ on a toothpaste,
you can sell it as a luxury product.”

The question is whether the category will continue to thrive as its most
lucrative demographic, the baby boomers, ages out of its prime
consumption years and a new cohort takes their place — or doesn’t.

## Plagues come, plagues go

Every year, Napa awaits the publication of Silicon Valley Bank’s “State
of the U.S. Wine Industry” analysis. In an interview, Mr. McMillan said
his increasingly vocal warnings of the millennial threat to the industry
were finally being heard.

“Every piece of research shows they’re lagging,” he said. “It’s not that
they don’t drink wine. There are just other choices. In the 1990s, there
was incredible wage growth, but beer sucked. Now, guess what? Beer is
good. And so are spirits.”

Mr. McMillan said he thought that in the short term, the coronavirus
pandemic might benefit the premium wine industry, with data showing
locked-down consumers “[willing to spend
up](https://svbwine.blogspot.com/2020/05/post-lock-down-opportunity-for-wineries.html),”
perhaps as they try to recreate the restaurant experience at home. But
the larger picture is not encouraging. When national crises come, so
does a sense that we are all going to be more serious, more responsible,
and stop buying expensive bottles of cabernet. After Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis, the luxury wine market
took painful hits. In such times, people don’t stop drinking; they just
buy less of the expensive stuff.

When I caught up with Mr. Beckstoffer again in March, by phone, he was
sequestered at home. The pandemic had, if anything, helped him come to
terms with his basket of concerns, putting them in perspective.

I asked him to compare the crisis to earlier troubles in his career of
half a century. In the 1970s, to buy Heublein’s land, he went into debt,
then saw the price of grapes crash, causing him to default on loans and
go into forfeiture. As he was beginning to recover, phylloxera hit and
many wineries went under. He saw it as an opportunity. “When hard times
hit, people sold,” he said. “That’s when we bought a lot of our
vineyards.”

He seemed sanguine about the Covid-19 economic crash. “In this business,
we tend to get seven or eight good years, then two or three bad ones,”
he said. In the mind of a farmer, plagues come and go.

The millenniums, however, still haunted him. “Millennials,” he corrected
himself.

“We’ll figure it out,” he continued. “A well-managed business will
always weather the storm. Nobody in Napa Valley is panicking. No land
that’s really good is for sale that I’ve seen. If something comes up,
I’ll probably buy
it.”
