# The Social-Distancing Shamers Are Watching

The internet has long been identified as a breeding ground for public
shaming, but the coronavirus has advanced the
game.

It was 80 degrees and sunny in [New York
City](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-social-distancing.html),
so I was lying slack on the couch, scrolling aimlessly through my phone,
when I [paused on a
photograph](https://twitter.com/LachCartwright/status/1257049652559577096)
shot a few miles away. A throng of people were sunbathing on the green
lawn of a Manhattan pier. In the center stood a man in a pair of floral
briefs and nothing else. With his arms akimbo and his chin turned
artfully to the side, he looked as if he were posing in a bodybuilding
lineup. In front of him was a woman with her face thrown up to the sky,
her hands rising as if to tousle her hair.

The photograph was taken at an angle that looked straight down the pier,
collapsing hundreds of feet of space so that the sunbathers appeared to
join together as one golden organism with toned muscles, a Celtic back
tattoo and a languid smile. The only indications that this was unlike
any other spring reverie were the baby blue surgical masks obscuring the
faces of two passers-by.

When [that
photo](https://twitter.com/LachCartwright/status/1257049652559577096)
and [others of the
pier](https://twitter.com/Welcome2theBX/status/1256763447209066496)
appeared on Twitter and Instagram, the scene was exposed to another kind
of crowd: people shut into their homes, skin drained of vitamin D, their
own spring plans frustrated by stay-at-home orders, sickness or grief.
Their replies to the posts swarmed with recriminations: The sunbathers
were the picture of privilege; the masks in the photo could be counted
on one hand; nobody would feel sorry if they died.

In recent months, similar images — of people strolling on a [boardwalk
in
Dorset](https://twitter.com/alukeonlife/status/1254568419116175367?s=21),
England, relaxing on a [beach in Orange
County](https://petapixel.com/2020/05/02/controversial-photo-of-crowds-on-ca-beach-was-shot-with-a-telephoto-lens/)
or shopping at [a flower market in
London](https://www.thecanary.co/trending/2020/03/22/selfish-reckless-members-of-the-british-public-are-still-rejecting-social-distancing-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/)
— have been dragged around the internet for rounds of judgment. The
internet has long been identified as a breeding ground for public shame,
but the coronavirus has advanced the game. If some benefit of the doubt
between strangers still existed in online discourse, this mysterious,
highly communicable and deadly illness has annihilated it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, we are grieving, afraid and confused. We are desperate for an
outlet, and indoor finger-pointing is one of the few hobbies still
accessible to those sheltering in place. Joggers have been [accused of
“manspreading” their
droplets](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/manspreading-running-social-distancing-jogging-men-coronavirus-a9491926.html)
across public airways. An [infant was
scolded](https://twitter.com/naanking/status/1258219591177629697?s=12)
for appearing maskless outdoors. Somebody [called the
cops](https://twitter.com/benyt/status/1256758795038085121) on a guy for
playing the trumpet, describing it as an “instrument that uses saliva
and wind.”

But the photograph of the crowded public space has become the defining
image of Covid shaming. We used to post photos of ourselves picnicking
in the park or sunbathing with our friends, and these shaming images
look eerily similar to those old tokens of springtime. Except now we’re
taking photos of other people, and saying that those people are bad.

In the strange absence of [photos documenting the coronavirus death
toll](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/opinion/coronavirus-photography.html),
sights of gaiety stand in for the morbid. The [Florida attorney Daniel
Uhlfelder](https://twitter.com/DWUhlfelderLaw/status/1256281243500625929)
has tried to make that association literal by dressing as the Grim
Reaper and stalking open beaches. To some, [the scene on the
pier](https://twitter.com/MichaelHartney/status/1256731376751120388/photo/1)
recalled “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,” Georges
Seurat’s pointillist painting of bourgeois Parisians lounging near the
Seine, which is shaded with a rebuke of their leisure-class pursuits.

The people who appear in these crowd shots are often suspected of
occupying a privileged tier of society. They may be affluent and white,
or at least young and healthy — the kinds of people least likely to be
seriously harmed by the virus, or by police. The pier photos circulated
just as [video emerged of a New York police
officer](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nypd-social-distancing-arrest-video-lower-east-side/)
beating and arresting a black man while enforcing social distancing. Of
[the 40 people the New York Police Department has
arrested](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/nyregion/nypd-social-distancing-race-coronavirus.html)
for social-distancing violations in Brooklyn, only one has been white;
during a pandemic, black New Yorkers have several reasons to feel unsafe
outside. Social-media shaming is often analogized to “violence” or
“policing,” but it looks nothing like actual violent policing.

</div>

There are other cultural messages embedded in these photos, too. The
images of people gathering on Florida beaches conjure [the dynamics of
the Florida Man
meme](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/07/15/feature/is-it-okay-to-laugh-at-florida-man-2/),
which delights in the broad-brush painting of Floridians as criminally
stupid hicks. The Christopher Street Pier, the site of New York’s viral
photos, is practically [a gay historic
landmark](https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/greenwich-village-waterfront-and-the-christopher-street-pier/)
— rainbow flags hang from its lampposts — and the outrage resurrects old
tropes that gay men make irresponsible and hedonistic use of the body.
Those photos were striking not just because the men in the photos were
not wearing masks, but also because they were not wearing shirts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A backlash to the backlash is brewing. Some of the photographs fueling
the shaming [have appeared
misleading](https://www.buzzfeed.com/joeydurso/coronavirus-social-distancing-lockdown-photos),
collapsing depth so that cyclists appear to be [breathing down each
other’s
necks](https://road.cc/content/news/times-latest-paper-try-shame-cyclists-dodgy-pics-272525)
and sunbathers seem to be [lying all over one
another](https://petapixel.com/2020/05/02/controversial-photo-of-crowds-on-ca-beach-was-shot-with-a-telephoto-lens/?fbclid=IwAR2rFh0hA_HqeI_7BUV9lgLhyuEnbI8qQJaradf-HMDSHNoZgoWQNJExytc).
Other photos taken of the [gathering on the
pier](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_vdTP3DeHC/?utm_source=ig_embed)
[reveal ample green
space](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_vWvBnDdRN/?igshid=tjlen2z39jvu)
between bodies. Defenders of the crowds have quickly evolved into
photographic forensic analysts, scouring metadata, analyzing shadows and
becoming conversant in the effects of Telephoto lenses.

They have also noted that the existence of the photo means that the
photographer was also in the crowded place. Flocking outside on a
beautiful day, even under the cloud of the virus, is a pretty universal
impulse, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo has recognized that New Yorkers [need to
do
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-is-shelter-in-place-coronavirus.html)
to maintain our sanity. (He has also ordered the wearing of masks in
public only when[“unable to maintain” social
distance](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20217-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency).)
What distinguishes the self-appointed enforcers of the crowd are their
attitudes. They too may be contributing to the city’s congested public
arteries, but at least they don’t like what they see.

Jon Ronson, in his 2015 account of social media ruinings, “[So You’ve
Been Publicly
Shamed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/04/19/books/review/jon-ronsons-so-youve-been-publicly-shamed.html),”
hypothesizes that online shamers believe they are doing a kind of public
service. Now that feeling has been wildly elevated: It feels as if
shaming could actually save lives. These photos have already inspired
policy shifts, elevating internet policing to actual policing: Days
after the pier photos were passed around, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New
York announced [a
plan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html#link-368d0d35)to
limit the number of people allowed in some parks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s not clear that further restricting already scarce public space will
help prevent the virus’s spread. What it will do is further entrench
[the power of the
police](https://time.com/5832403/nypd-pandemic-police-social-distancing-arrests/).
(De Blasio [expressed
regret](https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1258581714877722630) for the
racial “disparity” in arrests while continuing to insist that cops are
“saving lives.”) But the shaming feels righteous in the moment. I
know, from experience, that laying into a stranger online is one of the
easiest ways to convert anger into pleasure. Shaming the happy crowd
feels like stealing a little piece of their joy.

Most days I feel like both the shamer and the crowd. I have forgotten to
wear a mask, and I have eyed the maskless with suspicion. Both the
crowds and the shamers are reacting to the same stressor — a
catastrophically incompetent government response, which boils down to
warning us all to avoid human contact indefinitely.

The day that I saw those sunbathing photos, I went to the park, too,
where I picked my way through the pack to get some exercise and see a
goose. I have even, in the past several weeks, stretched my body across
a public lawn. I’m trying to be careful, but I’m also trying to still
feel like a person. I thought I was leaving a safe distance between
myself and others, but what did I know? What does anyone? I’m lucky
nobody decided that, actually, they did know better, and took my picture
to shame me — or worse.
