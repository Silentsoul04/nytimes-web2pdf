## About 100 children in N.Y. are suspected of having a rare illness tied to the virus.

New York State health officials are investigating about 100 cases of a
rare and dangerous inflammatory syndrome that afflicts children and
appears to be connected to the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on
Tuesday.

So far, three deaths in the state have been linked to the illness, which
is known as [pediatric multisystem inflammatory
syndrome](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/kawasaki-disease-coronavirus-children.html?module=inline)
and causes life-threatening inflammation in critical organs, Mr. Cuomo
said.

More than half of the state’s pediatric inflammatory syndrome cases — 57
percent — involved children ages 5 to 14.

Earlier in the day, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that 52 cases of the
syndrome, which has symptoms that overlap with those of toxic shock or
[Kawasaki
disease,](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/kawasaki-disease) had
been reported in New York City, and that 10 potential cases were being
evaluated.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The dead included a 5-year-old boy, who [died last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/nyregion/child-dead-new-virus-kawasaki.html?module=inline)
in New York City; a 7-year-old boy in Westchester County and an
18-year-old girl on Long Island.

“This is a truly disturbing situation,” Mr. Cuomo said at his daily news
briefing. “And I know parents around the state and around the country
are very concerned about this, and they should be.”

Hospitals across the state should make it a priority to test any
children displaying the syndrome’s symptoms for the coronavirus, the
governor said.

Mr. Cuomo’s announcement came as he reported 195 more virus-related
deaths in the state, an increase from Monday’s total but the second
consecutive day that the toll was under 200.

The pediatric illness [began to appear in the
region](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/nyregion/kawasaki-disease-coronavirus.html?module=inline)
in recent weeks, and doctors and researchers are still investigating how
and why it affects children.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Connecticut reported its first cases of the syndrome on Monday. As of
Tuesday, six children in the state were being treated for the ailment,
officials said.

Gov. Ned Lamont announced three of the Connecticut cases at a briefing
on Monday.

“I think right now it’s a very, very tiny risk of infection,” he said.
“It was not really ever detected in Asia, which, I don’t quite know
what that implies.”

Three other children were being treated for the syndrome at the
Connecticut Children’s Medical Center in Hartford, a spokeswoman, Monica
Buchanan, said on Tuesday. Two of the three were confirmed to have the
illness, Ms. Buchanan said.

New Jersey health officials said on Tuesday that they were investigating
10 potential cases of the syndrome, none of which were
fatal.

The number of new daily hospitalizations has fallen close to where it
was on March 19, just before Mr. Cuomo issued executive orders shutting
down much of the state.

“We’re making real progress, there’s no doubt,” Mr. Cuomo said. “But
there’s also no doubt that it’s no time to get cocky, no time to get
arrogant.”

While sounding that warning, Mr. Cuomo urged lawmakers in Washington to
give state and local governments whose budgets have been ravaged by the
pandemic the financial help they need to rebound.

“To get this economy up and running, we’re going to need an intelligent
stimulus bill,” Mr. Cuomo said.

He also said it would be impossible for New York to resume business as
normal without the money it needs to develop a sophisticated testing and
contact tracing apparatus.

It is unclear whether Congress will give Mr. Cuomo the help he is
seeking. Like President Trump, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican
majority leader, said he last month that he did not support what he has
labeled a blue state bailout.

testing and contact tracing of the virus that he said would be critical
to reopening the state’s economy.

Still, Mr. Murphy made the case that New Jersey — which, with New York,
has been at heart of the pandemic in the United States — is now more
affected by outbreak than other states. New Jersey, he said, had
overtaken New York and Connecticut in the rate of new infections and
deaths.

“There are still thousands in our hospitals, and sadly an untold number
more will perish,” Mr. Murphy said, while noting that the number of
hospitalizations, deaths and new cases had plunged since their mid-April
peak.

To continue to beat back the outbreak, New Jersey officials said they
planned to test up to 20,000 people a day by the end of May. The state
will also deploy hundreds of contact tracers to determine who has had
close interactions with a sick person, Mr. Murphy said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The state’s goal, the governor said, was to recruit a racially diverse
group of tracers who speak various languages and identify closely with
the communities where they will work. The job pays around $25 an hour,
he said.

The drop in the number of new virus cases means that the state can
consider a limited reopening, Mr. Murphy said, but he warned impatient
residents about the risk of loosening restrictions too soon. After
closing parks and golf courses in early April, [the state reopened them
on
May 2](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/02/nyregion/weather-parks-nyc-nj-coronavirus.html).
Mr. Murphy did not say which businesses may be the first to reopen.

Also on Tuesday, Mr. Murphy announced 198 new deaths — 139 more than
were reported the day before — for a total of 9,508. About half of the
fatalities involved nursing home residents. The daily report of new
deaths in New Jersey may include deaths that occurred weeks ago and were
only recently confirmed.

“Those numbers don’t lie,” Mr. Murphy said. “We are still the most
impacted state in
America.”

The puzzle of how to revive New York City’s tourist trade is so vexing
that city officials are pulling together a group of industry experts —
and one of the biggest names on Broadway — to try to solve it.

On Tuesday, the city’s tourism agency, NYC & Company, said it was
establishing the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Coalition for
NYC Hospitality & Tourism Recovery. Among the group’s leaders:
Lin-Manuel Miranda, the composer, lyricist and actor who created the
musical “Hamilton.”

The coalition’s task is to come up with a plan for wooing people back to
the city once it starts to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, a
chapter that appears to be months off at least after the Broadway League
said on Tuesday that [its members were canceling shows through
Sept 6](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/theater/broadway-coronavirus.html).

Company’s chairman and executive vice president of the Shubert
Organization.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Joining Mr. Flatemen and Mr. Miranda at the group’s helm are Ellen
Futter, the president of the American Museum of Natural History, [which
recently announced a number of
layoffs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/arts/design/natural-history-layoffs-virus.html);
Thelma Golden, the Studio Museum in Harlem’s director and chief curator;
the restaurateur Danny Meyer; and Peter Ward, the president of the New
York Hotel & Motel Trades Council.

Before the pandemic struck, NYC & Company was forecasting an 11th
straight year of increased tourism. In 2019, the city had more than 66
million visitors who generated about $70 billion of economic activity
that supported 400,000 jobs, according to the agency’s estimates.

“Together, we will create a next act for our city,” Mr. Miranda said in
a
statement.

## N.Y.C. is expanding testing and tracing, but a limited reopening is weeks away.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. de Blasio on Tuesday announced an expansion of coronavirus testing
and tracing across New York City, but he warned again that a limited
reopening of the city was weeks away at best.

Twelve new testing sites will be set up in the next three weeks in a
push to double the public hospital system’s testing capacity, the mayor
said at his daily news briefing. The city was also training 535 [contact
tracers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/nyregion/coronavirus-contact-tracing-nyc.html),
with a goal of having 2,500 in the field by early June.

Still, the city, the pandemic’s U.S. epicenter, has met just four of the
seven [criteria required to start to
reopen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/nyregion/coronavirus-reopen-cuomo-ny.html),
Mr. Cuomo said on Monday while announcing that three upstate regions had
achieved all of the necessary benchmarks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. de Blasio has said he is closely monitoring three measures in
weighing the city’s progress toward reopening: the number of new virus
infections; the number of infected patients in intensive care units; and
the percentage of residents testing positive for the virus.

“Clearly, these indicators are not getting us the kind of answers we
need to change our restrictions in May,” the mayor said. “You’ve got to
have 10 days to two weeks of consistent, downward motion. We haven’t had
that in a sustained way at all.”

More than 20,000 deaths in New York City have now been linked to the
virus, according to [data from the city’s Department of
Health](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

## Connecticut moves toward reopening as top health official is ousted.

With Connecticut nearing the May 20 date that officials have set for
starting a gradual reopening, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Tuesday that the
state continued to make steady progress in stemming the coronavirus
outbreak.

Mr. Lamont, speaking at a daily news briefing, reported 33 new virus
deaths, eight fewer than on Monday. The virus has now been linked to
3,041 deaths in Connecticut.

“Hopefully the fatalities continue to go down,” Mr. Lamont said.

The governor also said the total number of patients hospitalized with
the virus had fallen to 1,189 from 1,212. He reported 568 new confirmed
virus cases, which he suggested was in line with an increase in
testing.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Mr. Lamont’s briefing came several hours after he said he was replacing
the state’s public health commissioner, Renee Coleman-Mitchell, who had
been in the job about a year. She had not been at his daily briefings in
recent weeks.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The governor did not discuss his reasons for making the change, saying
only that he had appointed the state’s social services commissioner,
Deidre Gifford, to fill the post for the time being.

Ms. Coleman-Mitchell’s “service over the last year has been a great deal
of help, particularly in the face of the global Covid-19 pandemic that
has brought disruption to many throughout the world,” Mr. Lamont said in
a statement.

In a statement issued by a lawyer, Ms. Coleman-Mitchell said she had
been told by members of the governor’s staff that the move “was not
related to job performance.”

“I am proud of the work of the Department of Public Health during this
time of unprecedented turmoil and threat to the public health,” she
added.

## Tell us about the moments that have brought you hope, strength, humor and relief.

The coronavirus outbreak has brought much of life in New York to a halt
and there is no clear end in sight. But there are also moments that
offer a sliver of strength, hope, humor or some other type of relief: a
joke from a stranger on line at the supermarket; a favor from a friend
down the block; a great meal ordered from a restaurant we want to
survive; trivia night via Zoom with the bar down the street.

We’d like to hear about your moments, the ones that are helping you
through these dark times. A reporter or editor may contact you. Your
