As concerns mount over children with a [serious and potentially deadly
inflammatory
condition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/kawasaki-disease-coronavirus-children.html),
a new study sheds light on the illness’s distinctive characteristics and
provides the strongest evidence yet that the syndrome is linked to [the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-children-sick.html).

The condition, called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, has
been reported in about [100 children in New York
State](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html),
including three who died, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said this week. Cases
have been reported in other states, including Louisiana, Mississippi and
[California](https://hosppeds.aappublications.org/content/hosppeds/early/2020/04/06/hpeds.2020-0123.full.pdf),
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will soon
issue an alert asking doctors to report cases of children with symptoms
of the syndrome.

There have also been at least 50 cases reported in European countries,
including in France, Switzerland, Spain and Britain, where at least one
[death has been attributed to the
syndrome](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31094-1/fulltext).

In the new
[study](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31103-X/fulltext),
published on Wednesday in the journal Lancet, doctors in Italy compared
a series of 10 cases of the illness with cases of a similar rare
condition in children called Kawasaki disease.

The authors found that over the five years before the coronavirus
pandemic — January 2015 to mid-February 2020 — 19 children with Kawasaki
disease were treated at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, which has an
advanced pediatric department, in the Bergamo
province.

But during the two months from February 18 to April 20 alone, the
hospital, which is at the epicenter of Italy’s coronavirus outbreak,
treated 10 children with similar hyper-inflammatory symptoms.

Ten cases in two months — about 30 times the rate of the Kawasaki
disease cases, which occurred at a pace of about one every three months
— suggests a cluster that is driven by the coronavirus pandemic,
especially since overall hospital admissions during this time were much
lower than usual, the authors said.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Nevertheless, the authors noted that the number of cases was small,
suggesting that the new syndrome was unlikely to be widespread among
children, who have generally been [less hard hit by the virus than
adults](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/health/coronavirus-children-us.html).

None of the 10 children died, but their symptoms were more severe than
those experienced by the children with Kawasaki disease. They were much
more likely to have heart complications, and five of them exhibited
shock, which did not occur in any of the Kawasaki disease cases. They
had lower counts of platelets and a type of white blood cell, typical of
Covid-19 patients defending against the infection. And more of the
children with the new syndrome needed treatment with steroids in
addition to the immunoglobulin treatment that both they and the Kawasaki
patients received.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Like the cases in the United States and elsewhere, the 10 children were
generally significantly older than the patients with Kawasaki disease,
which tends to strike infants and preschoolers. The average age of the
Kawasaki patients was 3. All but one of the children with the new
syndrome were older than 5 and their average age was 7
½.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Eight of the 10 children tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. The
researchers suggested that negative test results for the other two
children might reflect the fact that the tests were not perfectly
accurate and that one of the children had just been treated with a large
dose of immunoglobulin, which could have interfered with the test’s
ability to detect antibodies.

The presence of antibodies suggests that the Italian children, like many
of the cases in the United States, were infected with the virus weeks
earlier. Experts say the new inflammatory syndrome appears to be a
delayed reaction driven by a child’s immune system response to the
infection, in contrast to the primary way that the virus affects
patients by attacking the cells in their
lungs.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: From the earliest days of the coronavirus, health officials
    believed that it largely spared children and teenagers, but recently
    that belief has been challenged. My colleague Pam Belluck on the
    story of a 14-year-old boy whose case is being studied to better
    understand the impact of the virus on children.
    
    It’s Thursday, May 21.
    
    Pam, when does this understanding that we all seem to have about the
    coronavirus and how it spares children, when does that start to
    change?

  - pam belluck  
    In late April, there was this bulletin that was sent out by a
    pediatric health service in the United Kingdom. It just said we’re
    noticing some kids, not very many. They seem to have these symptoms
    of inflammation. We don’t really know what this is about. Some have
    tested positive for coronavirus. Some haven’t. And it was just kind
    of saying we think we’re seeing something.
    
    So I talked to my editors about it, and we were trying to figure out
    whether we should explore it more at that point. And we decided,
    well, we don’t really know a whole lot. It seems like a small number
    of cases. We can’t even say for certain that it’s connected to
    coronavirus, and so we just kind of put it aside for a bit and watch
    it.
    
    And then I think a couple days later I got an email from a hospital
    in New York City. The person said we’ve got two cases of this
    syndrome that they’ve been talking about in the UK. If you want to
    talk to somebody, let us know. And that’s how I got to know Jack
    McMorrow and his family in their apartment in Queens.

  - michael barbaro  
    And tell me about this visit.

  - pam belluck  
    It’s a very warm, kind of cozy apartment. There are all these
    “welcome home” banners and balloons for Jack. And the family, Jack
    and his father John and his mother Doris, they just immediately
    welcomed me and our photographer Gabriela in, and they all just
    start talking. I just know immediately I have to put on my tape
    recorder because there’s no way I’m going to capture all this
    writing things down.

  - john mcmorrow  
    He sent him a letter.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yes. Can I explain something —

  - john mcmorrow  
    Oh, come on. I’m giving backdrop here. You can explain all you want.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    No. First of all, I wanted to talk about how the virus was behaving
    like a bacteria.

  - john mcmorrow  
    OK, you’re gonna, but I just want to say —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    That was way back when.

  - john mcmorrow  
    — Randall —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    This thing’s probably not picking up anything.

  - doris stroman  
    I hope you know she’s taping all of you because —

  - john mcmorrow  
    Yeah, we barter like this all day long.

  - doris stroman  
    I got a bell from school —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Stop with the bell.

  - doris stroman  
    — because they bicker. And I have to do this —

  - john mcmorrow  
    And it’s a timeout bell.

  - doris stroman  
    — and tell them to both go to each corner.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I’m sorry about all this chaotic —

  - pam belluck  
    It’s wonderful. It’s wonderful.

  - \[bell ringing\]

  - john mcmorrow  
    And these cleaned arteries, they have to bring you right back.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I was coherent at this time.

  - john mcmorrow  
    No, I know. But I know you’ve been jumping things, and I know when
    you’re excited.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Me jumping things?

  - pam belluck  
    You’re doing great. You’re doing great.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Dad, you went from day one to me in the new I.C.U. That’s like a —

  - doris stroman  
    Do I need to get my bell?

  - jack mcmorrow  
    — huge jump. Dude, if —

  - speaker  
    Oh my God.

michael barbaro

And tell me about this family. Who are they?

pam belluck

So Jack’s father is John McMorrow.

  - john mcmorrow  
    I know it’s your story, son.

pam belluck

He is a truck driver. He works as a Teamster for the film industry. He
was recently laid off because of the pandemic. And his mother, Jack’s
mother, is Doris Stroman. She works at a lab school with five and
six-year-old kids. She was wearing a mask that had The Rolling Stones
tongue logo on it.

  - doris stroman  
    — to figure out what was going on, starting with his pediatrician.

pam belluck

And Jack is 14. He’s a ninth grader. He goes to Catholic school in
Queens.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yeah, and I have a whole bunch of other prop replica stuff.

  - pam belluck  
    So you’re a Star Wars fan?

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I like Marvel a lot more than I do —

  - pam belluck  
    Oh, you’re more of a Marvel person. OK.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    This is the Infinity Gauntlet from “Avengers: Infinity War.” I
    really have to —

  - doris stroman  
    They don’t have time for that, Jack.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    This is why —

michael barbaro

And, Pam, what is the story that Jack and his parents tell you about
this mysterious condition that he has?

pam belluck

So Jack was living the world of a New York City teenager in a pandemic.

  - doris stroman  
    He never left the house.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I haven’t left —

  - john mcmorrow  
    Since March 13, he’s been in the house.

  - doris stroman  
    You never left the house. His school —

  - john mcmorrow  
    In his room, not even in here.

  - doris stroman  
    His Catholic school was one of the first that were closed.

  - pam belluck  
    Oh wow.

  - doris stroman  
    Didn’t leave the house.

pam belluck

March 12 was his last day of school, and he was doing the online
learning thing.

  - doris stroman  
    The one time he left the house other than — was to help me with the
    laundry and didn’t want to touch anything.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I took a shower after I came up from the laundry room.

  - doris stroman  
    Yeah, the kid just —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I’m a germophobe.

pam belluck

They just kind of stayed in. He was playing video games. He was chatting
with his friends and that kind of thing. That was Jack’s world.

\[music\]

Then in mid-April, Jack’s parents start to notice some unusual things.

  - john mcmorrow  
    Three weeks ago, he came out to me with a rash on the backside of
    his hands.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yeah.

  - john mcmorrow  
    I thought it was —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    It was bad.

  - john mcmorrow  
    — from the antibacterial soap. You know, Purell. Maybe he’s doing it
    too much. He’s sensitive.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yeah, for like — we thought it was nothing more than eczema.

  - john mcmorrow  
    And then I think a day or two later he —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    No, it was like —

  - john mcmorrow  
    — your mother told you something about your eyes. She thought you
    were playing video games too much.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yeah, the eyes definitely, but I don’t know if that was —

pam belluck

They went on, and then the next week — and this was April 21 —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I had got a normal fever, like 101, 102.

pam belluck

— Jack gets a fever.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I woke up one day with —

  - doris stroman  
    Sore throat.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    — sore throat. That was the first inflammation symptom that we had,
    which was —

  - doris stroman  
    On his hands, on his feet —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    On my hands, on my feet —

  - doris stroman  
    — on his neck.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    — and on my neck. That was the first —

pam belluck

And then around Friday, April 24, things start to get more severe.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    That ended up being a swollen lymph node that grew to about the size
    of a tennis ball that you could visibly see coming on the side of my
    neck.

  - doris stroman  
    That was alarming.

pam belluck

By the next day, Saturday morning, he wakes up and he’s got a 104.7
fever.

michael barbaro

That is a real fever.

pam belluck

That is a serious fever. They call their pediatrician at 7:30 in the
morning, and she says, you guys, you got to get to an urgent care
clinic, and they do. And there he gets a coronavirus test, but it’s
going to be a couple days before he gets the results.

michael barbaro

So at this point they think it might perhaps be Covid-19.

pam belluck

It doesn’t look like Covid-19, but we’re living in a world of Covid-19,
and so I think that they are just sort of saying, well, let’s just test
him. We don’t really know what this is. They send him home. Things just
keep getting worse and worse. And by Monday morning, Jack wakes up. He
cannot move. He can’t move.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Because I wake up, and to even sit up, I screamed for them. And I
    had 105 almost.

pam belluck

And he’s lying on the couch.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I was sleeping with my socks on, and he kind of saw red. And he
    takes off my socks to reveal my entire feet, right here, had just
    rashes on the insides and bottom.

  - doris stroman  
    At that time —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    And my hands.

  - doris stroman  
    — we thought that was the apex.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    And my hands.

  - doris stroman  
    But it wasn’t until days later.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yeah, they thought that was bad. My hands here on my palms, a little
    bit at the back, all rashes. So my skin — to even touch my skin and
    feel —

pam belluck

It’s terribly, terribly frightening. And he says to me, I was very
emotional.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I’m using the word emotional to try and cover up the fact I was
    crying like a baby. It was so bad.

pam belluck

They happen to have a home blood pressure monitor, so they take his
blood pressure. And this is where, as if all of these symptoms weren’t
alarming enough and frightening enough, the blood pressure is very low.
And so they know they had to take him to the hospital. They had to
figure out how to get him out of the house. He can’t move. So John and
Jack kind of demonstrate this for me.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I put my hands on his arms like this and, not kidding, shuffled my
    way.

  - john mcmorrow  
    And I had to then hold him up —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    With his arms.

pam belluck

John picks him up, puts Jack’s feet on top of John’s feet, and then
walks backward out the apartment door, sort of shuffling Jack along.

  - doris stroman  
    And when we got to the hospital —

  - john mcmorrow  
    They took a wheelchair.

  - doris stroman  
    — they took a wheelchair.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yeah, I took a wheelchair.

  - doris stroman  
    He couldn’t walk.

  - john mcmorrow  
    He couldn’t walk no more. He couldn’t bend his legs.

pam belluck

So he gets to the hospital. They are trying to figure out, again, what’s
going on. They don’t know.

  - john mcmorrow  
    — everything back and forth. You had a cardiologist department. You
    had the pulmonary specialist, infectious disease experts, and then
    you had the immunology all throwing numbers and prescriptions and
    how they count through each other to deal with him. And this is
    stuff that I — it’s French to me. You might as well just tell me —

pam belluck

And while he’s there, they get the coronavirus test results back from
the clinic that he went to on Saturday two days earlier.

michael barbaro

And what does it say?

pam belluck

They’re negative. So they’re crossing that off the list. They say, we
really should probably send you home because we don’t really know what
this is, and we think maybe you can just kind of watch it at home.

  - doris stroman  
    Because they were riding the wave that he tested negative.

pam belluck

Well, Doris is not happy about that. She says —

  - doris stroman  
    And I said, well, he needs to be tested again. And she said, we only
    test those who are admitted. And I said, well, then he needs to be
    admitted. We have nowhere to be —

pam belluck

So there’s a communication around that. And they agree there’s no harm
in doing another coronavirus test. Why not? We don’t really know what’s
happening. Why not? So they do another coronavirus test. And then while
they’re there waiting, another symptom emerges.

  - doris stroman  
    When he woke up, his eyes were like this. And I was just like, what
    just —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yeah, they were rolling in the back of my head.

  - doris stroman  
    And they were red.

pam belluck

His eyes turned bright red. As his mom is telling me about this, she is
pointing to a red pillow on their couch, and she says, it’s like this.
And his eyes are rolling back into his head, and they’re bright red.

  - doris stroman  
    He was like, I’m fine, I’m fine, like this. I’m fine. I’m fine.

  - john mcmorrow  
    When was this?

pam belluck

Then the doctor comes in and tells them that, guess what? The new
coronavirus test, the second one, it was positive.

michael barbaro

Pam, how could that be that he has a negative test and just a few days
later, suddenly a positive test?

pam belluck

Well, unfortunately this is kind of the reality of coronavirus testing
right now that they are not 100 percent reliable. It’s a little bit of a
Wild West situation. So there are cases of false negatives, and that’s
obviously what was the case with Jack. So once they realize that he is
Covid positive, they decide at that hospital that he’s got to go to a
children’s hospital. And Jack is not on board with this. He does not
want to go.

And the doctor says to him, “If I send you home today, you will be dead
by tomorrow.”

  - jack mcmorrow  
    That, I would say, had scared me to death. But it more scared me to
    life. It scared me to fight.

pam belluck

So Jack gets to the children’s hospital in the ambulance. And the
doctors take one look, and they realize, this is not what we thought
coronavirus infection looks like. This is not the way it usually affects
patients. And they know that by looking at Jack and figuring out what’s
going on with him, they are going to learn a lot more about what this
virus can do to kids.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I’m getting to the pain now. It was a throbbing, stinging rush of,
    like, you could feel it going through your veins.

pam belluck

So when Jack gets to the hospital, he is just exhausted and in so much
pain.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    You could feel — it was almost like someone injected you with
    straight up fire. Just fire.

pam belluck

The major symptom that’s going on with Jack is that he has very low
blood pressure.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    You’ve got to remember, my heart rate was at 165 while I was
    sleeping. That’s like a marathon runner.

pam belluck

And he has a very, very fast heart rate, because his heart is trying
very hard to compensate for that low blood pressure that is preventing
him from pumping oxygen and nutrients throughout his body to his
critical organs. So that’s what they’ve got to treat. That is a
condition that is called cardiogenic shock. It is heart failure. It is
fatal if not treated. And he was telling me that he started to focus his
energy. He started to feel like, I have got to understand what is going
on with my body. I’ve got to know, because if I don’t know what I’m
fighting, then I can’t fight it. So he starts to talk to the doctors.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    They don’t get a lot of kids that can actually talk to them since
    it’s pediatrics.

pam belluck

And he’s a ninth-grade kid, and he’s been taking biology, and he has
some understanding about the heart and the lungs and how they all work.
And so he’s asking them lots of questions.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    We were going back and forth with the whole — especially the way my
    heart related to my cardiovascular and circulatory system, never
    mind my —

pam belluck

And that made him feel much more in control, or at least it was a little
bit less terrifying for him once he kind of realized what he could
understand. But in that first day or two —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    It was scary.

pam belluck

— he did feel like he wasn’t going to come out of it.

  - speaker  
    It didn’t look like I was coming out of it the same, if at all.

michael barbaro

And how do the doctors try to treat Jack during this time?

pam belluck

So the first thing that they’re trying to do is give him blood pressure
medication to try to get his blood pressure up, but it’s just not
working. It’s been 48 hours. And they are so worried about his heart,
which is not pumping enough oxygen to his body, that they think they’re
going to need to put him on a ventilator.

michael barbaro

Wow.

  - john mcmorrow  
    They were going to intubate him. And I said, you know, that was
    breaking my heart.

  - doris stroman  
    If they were to —

  - john mcmorrow  
    And so did they. They didn’t want it, because they know that they
    had to brace me on the realistic approach that only 20 percent come
    off.

pam belluck

So they say, well, you know, why don’t we try some steroids? Now,
steroids are this widely used medication that works in a lot of
different ways and works for some things, it doesn’t work for other
things, and it’s really hard to know whether it’s going to help him or
not. But within a few hours, he starts to stabilize. They decide they
don’t need the ventilator, and —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    They were bringing me Icees and ginger ale —

  - john mcmorrow  
    They were bringing him everything, lollipops —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    — and I hadn’t had water.

  - john mcmorrow  
    He hadn’t no water, nothing in his mouth for over 48 hours because
    they were —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    For 48 hours.

  - john mcmorrow  
    — preparing him to do the tube.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    My mouth was — I felt like I was dying. And then they were throwing
    Icees my way. They were like, here you go, kid. They gave me
    lollipops. They gave me ginger ales. I was, like, living the life.

pam belluck

So it seems like the steroids worked, but doctors actually don’t know
that 100 percent. And John, Jack’s father, called the pediatrician,
their longtime pediatrician, and said, what happened? I don’t know what
happened. And —

  - john mcmorrow  
    He laughed. And I said, why? Why? Why? How did this happen? What did
    he do? And he goes, I don’t know. I said, you know my family’s going
    to believe this was the power of prayer. And he goes, I’ll go with
    that, because we don’t know why. We don’t know.

pam belluck

My family is going to think that it’s a miracle. And the pediatrician
says, well, that works for me because I don’t really know either.

michael barbaro

And Pam, beyond the steroids and whether or not those worked, what did
the doctors understand about what was going on here?

pam belluck

Well, they’re kind of mystified. I mean, they’ve got this kid, and they
know that he has a positive coronavirus test, but he doesn’t have
symptoms that kind of look like what they’ve come to expect from
coronavirus. And at the same time, just that very morning they’ve had
two or three other kids show up with the same symptoms, very similar
symptoms. And those kids have tested negative for coronavirus. So they
don’t have a live coronavirus infection, but the doctors are wondering.

And so they have another test in their toolkit. They have what’s called
an antibody test, which can tell you not whether you have the live
infection right now, but it can tell you whether somebody has ever had
coronavirus infection. And they think, let’s just give these kids —
these other kids that test and see.

And lo and behold, those kids end up being positive for coronavirus
antibodies. And that means that all of these kids who are showing up
with these mysterious symptoms that cannot be explained by anything else
that doctors know have this one common denominator. They have all had
coronavirus.

michael barbaro

Pam, at this point, what do the doctors think that this is exactly?
Because all of these kids have had coronavirus, but most of them don’t
still have it.

pam belluck

What they think is this may be a kind of second-stage effect of
coronavirus that we didn’t know was possible, that we didn’t know was
part of the way this virus worked. These kids didn’t get the lung
problems, the breathing problems, that kind of assault on the lungs that
is the primary way that coronavirus works.

And so what the doctors think is that at the time of their infection,
their immune system did a really good job of just swatting the infection
away, of battling it away — that’s why they didn’t have any symptoms at
the time. But that somehow in the course of that fight, their immune
system got so revved up and so hyperactive that it generated this
inflammatory response weeks later, and their bodies had this incredible
overzealous reaction that went throughout their bodies and caused all
sorts of havoc.

michael barbaro

So this is not coronavirus for kids. It’s some kind of
later-down-the-line, affiliated set of horrible conditions that follows
it.

pam belluck

Exactly.

michael barbaro

I mean, what seems particularly scary about this is that theoretically
any kid who has had the coronavirus — and I have to imagine there are
tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of these across the
United States, people like Jack who probably showed no symptoms
whatsoever from the original infection — it now seems possible that they
could develop these really awful new secondary symptoms.

pam belluck

That’s exactly the risk here. That’s exactly the worry. We know that
kids are just as likely to get infected as adults. They don’t have any
protection from infection. A whole lot of them end up showing no
symptoms. And we wanted to think that that meant that they really
weren’t getting that sick. But now we have this thing that shows up
weeks later, and we don’t have any idea who will end up with this
inflammatory syndrome and when.

michael barbaro

I mean, what are the implications of that as we think about reopening
schools, for example? I mean, one of the kind of saving graces, silver
linings of this pandemic was that kids were supposed to be spared, and
that understanding seems to have been the basis for plans to reopen
schools. What does it mean that this second-stage set of symptoms is now
starting to show up among children?

pam belluck

It definitely puts a serious complication in those plans. It’s something
that governors, federal officials, they are already thinking about —
they are going to have to think about. It’s not like you can test kids
and say, OK, you’re negative, or you have antibodies, you’re going to be
fine. Because you could have antibodies, and then you could end up with
this. So it makes that issue much more tenuous and much more
complicated, and I don’t think anybody has a good answer for that right
now.

michael barbaro

And Pam, how is Jack doing at this point?

pam belluck

He’s doing OK. He’s home.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    And I came home to take the best shower I’ve ever had in my entire
    life. Not even gassing it. It was like 30 minutes.

  - doris stroman  
    You can’t get him in, and then you can’t get him out.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    No, no, no. It was like —

  - doris stroman  
    You know. You have kids.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    It was like 30 minutes, this one. And it felt fine, and then I was
    like, I got to stop running around because I’m going to fall. I’m
    going to get lightheaded and pass out. But completely ignoring my
    own self advice, just ran into my room, put on my headphones, talked
    to my friends, and I said, I’m home\! And they were all like, yeah\!

  - doris stroman  
    Any time he runs around —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    And it was the best.

  - doris stroman  
    — and says I’m alive, I’m alive —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    No.

  - doris stroman  
    — we go, “I’m a real boy\!”

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I’m a real boy.

  - doris stroman  
    I’m a real boy\!

  - jack mcmorrow  
    No, no, no, because I said that.

  - doris stroman  
    From “Pinocchio.”

  - jack mcmorrow  
    No, because I was in the hospital, and I was like there are no
    strings on me because —

  - john mcmorrow  
    Because he did IVs —

pam belluck

He has some residual heart issues, but they think that his issues,
because he’s so young and otherwise healthy, that he’ll probably emerge
from this with no real issues. They are going to be following him.
They’re going to be following these other kids, too, because this is
still a mystery, and they don’t really know whether it’s going to have
any long-term effects.

And since his case, since his successful treatment, doctors have been
using the same playbook on other kids with his issue. So they think that
the steroids were what helped him, and they are giving other kids
steroids a lot earlier when they come into the hospital. So far,
apparently the results have been pretty encouraging. They are writing up
Jack’s case, along with some of the other kids, in an article that’s
going to be published in a medical journal. Jack was very excited to
learn about that. And he said to me —

  - jack mcmorrow  
    It’s been really good being back home, and I just want to do more
    with my life now, now that I have it back.

pam belluck

I really want to do something with my life, now that I have it back.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    In any way that I can.

  - pam belluck  
    That is awesome.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    Yeah.

pam belluck

He said this while holding his Captain America shield. So I thought —

He is, after all, a 14-year-old.

pam belluck

He is, after all, a 14-year-old boy.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I literally sent my biology teacher an email, saying thank you for
    educating me.

  - pam belluck  
    Really?

  - john mcmorrow  
    Oh, that was the first thing he did.

  - jack mcmorrow  
    I can show you it if you want.

  - john mcmorrow  
    Yes. You should actually —

  - pam belluck  
    I would love to see it.

  - john mcmorrow  
    — show it.

  - doris stroman  
    No, no, not now. Not now. Let her have it so —

  - pam belluck  
    Yeah, why don’t you email it to me.

  - doris stroman  
    It’s long, so just let her read it when she gets a minute.

\[READING JACK’S EMAIL\] “OK, I’ll try to make this email quick, because
I’m still in the hospital recovering. The complications of this virus
have left me with pneumonia. And more serious than that, heart issues. A
mild heart blockage, as explained by the doctors. This heart blockage is
the main reason I’m not at home recovering right now, but rather in a
cardio-monitoring room.

“As hard as it is to keep up with all of this and understand many
aspects of these complications, because of how little they know of
Covid, I have to say, once it came around to them talking to me about my
heart and my systems, I’m confident that I was able to keep up with the
conversation and understand what was wrong with me and what to do to
keep fighting — or rather, to keep my vitals in check.

“To summarize what I’m trying to say — and this is the honest truth — I
would like to thank you for educating me as you did and for providing me
the educational support to understand my body when I need to most.
Because based off of my knowledge on my heart and circulatory system,
I’m now able to work off of that knowledge and help myself understand
the doctors and communicate to them.

“I don’t want to drag this out, and I know I said that I’d try to make
this short, but I really do have to thank you for educating me enough to
know what I needed to know. I’m sorry for making this email so long, and
I really feel bad for disturbing you on a Saturday night. But seriously,
I’m genuinely thanking you for educating me as you did, and I look
forward to seeing you on Zoom or in class if we return this school year.

“I hope your family and yourself stay safe. Thank you.”

michael barbaro

That’s lovely.

pam belluck

Isn’t that amazing?

michael barbaro

Is he back in school remotely?

pam belluck

He is back. Jack is back in school remotely. He’s taking that biology
class and he’s seeing his friends. And he is — he is being Jack.

michael barbaro

Thank you, Pam. We really appreciate it.

pam belluck

Thank you.

Last week, health officials gave Jack’s condition a name: Multisystem
inflammatory syndrome in children. So far, it has been found in about
200 children in the U.S. and Europe, and has killed several of them.
Because the condition was just identified, it’s unclear how many cases
have remained unreported. We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (andy beshear)  
    Retail opened today. Big day, big step. And what we saw out there
    from everything that we could see is people trying really hard.

michael barbaro

On Wednesday, two months after the pandemic began, all 50 states began
reopening to varying degrees.

  - archived recording (andy beshear)  
    And that’s important, because we have one shot at reopening the
    economy the right way.

michael barbaro

Kentucky permitted retailers to let in customers. Connecticut allowed
restaurants and malls to reopen with significant limits. And New York
allowed religious gatherings of up to 10 people.

  - archived recording (andrew cuomo)  
    I understand their desire to get back to religious ceremonies as
    soon as possible. As a former altar boy, I get it. I think those
    religious ceremonies can be very comforting.

michael barbaro

But there were signs on Wednesday that the reopenings would be slow and
risky. Ford, which restarted its U.S. assembly lines earlier this week,
said it would halt operations at plants in Illinois and Michigan after
workers there tested positive for the virus.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.
