Nearly three million new unemployment claims brought the two-month total

[Scattershot
reopenings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)
of retail stores, nail salons and restaurants around the country have
not halted the flood of layoffs, with the [government
reporting](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) Thursday that nearly three
million people filed
[unemployment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/business/economy/unemployment-claims-coronavirus.html)
claims last week, bringing the two-month tally to more than 36 million.

The [weekly count of new claims has been
declining](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html)
since late March, but that hopeful flicker barely stands out in an
otherwise grim and chaotic economic landscape.

“This is a very protracted, painful situation for the labor market,”
said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics,
“and I just don’t see anything positive.”

In places where the fitful reopening has started, workers called back to
their
[jobs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/business/economy/coronavirus-stimulus-unemployment.html)often
face reduced hours and paychecks as well as a heightened risk of
infection. Declining to return, however, is likely to put an end to any
jobless benefits.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s a very tough choice for those in the service industry and those at
the lower end of the pay scale,” Ms. Farooqi said. “Do you go back and
risk getting sick, or have no money coming in?”

Lags in data make it hard to calculate just how many workers may have
been rehired after the most recent shelter-in-place restrictions were
lifted. And Connecticut [cited an
error](https://twitter.com/CTDOL/status/1260962610729619456/photo/1) in
the government’s report that appeared to have inflated the state’s
latest claims by more than 200,000.

But Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America, said she
doubted that callbacks to work outnumbered additional layoffs from other
sectors. The slowdown has been rippling beyond the early shutdowns in
retail and hospitality to professional business services, manufacturing
and health care.

“In a sense, it’s a rolling shock,” she said.

Georgia, one of the first states to reopen, is an example. “The
reopening is bringing people back to work, reducing the total amount of
people receiving
[unemployment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html)
insurance,” Ms. Meyer noted. “But the number of initial jobless claims
is still rising, which suggests there is still residual weakness in the
economy.”

In an analysis of the latest

report, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that in [11
states](https://www.uschamber.com/series/above-the-fold/analysis-these-10-states-have-seen-the-highest-share-of-their-workforce-file),
more than a quarter of those in the work force in February were now
unemployed. And a [survey by the Federal
Reserve](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-poor-economy.html)
found that in households making less than $40,000 a year, nearly 40
percent of those who were working in February lost their jobs in March
or the beginning of April.

But even as states strive to keep up with the onslaught of claims, many
workers remain supremely frustrated, either by their inability to submit
applications or by payment delays. According to a poll for The New York
Times in early May by the online research firm SurveyMonkey, more than
half of those applying for unemployment benefits in recent weeks were
unsuccessful.

And as of Saturday, 20 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico
had not paid out any money under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance
program, which Congress passed in March to help freelancers, the
self-employed and other workers not normally eligible for state jobless
benefits.

Some of those being called back to work have never seen a penny of
government aid.

Jason Cooper, 43, went back to his serving job at the Savour restaurant
in Tallahassee, Fla., in early May without ever receiving the jobless
benefits he spent weeks trying to track down.

government aid. In mid-April, a few days after he successfully submitted
a claim, his employer secured a loan and began paying workers again.

Mr. Cooper was lucky: he had some savings that helped cover four weeks
without income, and he temporarily moved in with his mother in St.
Augustine, Fla. He plans to wait out the pandemic before trying to go to
a state office to claim the backdated benefits he believes he is owed.

“It was so difficult to get through the first time that I have no real
faith that the system is going to work anytime in the near future,” he
said.

At first, Mr. Cooper was concerned about returning to work, but now he
feels comfortable in the small restaurant, where employees are not
wearing masks but are using single-use gloves for serving. Tables have
also been spaced farther apart. “It feels shockingly normal,” he said.

Other workers who have been called back say they are scared of getting
sick but feel they have no choice. Some states are taking a hard line.
Nebraska [posted a notice
online](https://dol.nebraska.gov/PressRelease/Details/153) declaring
that failing to return to work “could be considered fraud” and
potentially disqualify people from receiving benefits. In South
Carolina, workers are [not eligible for
benefits](https://dew.sc.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/covid-19-related-ui-information.pdf?sfvrsn=133a12f0_0)
if they don’t work because they are isolating themselves to avoid
exposure to the virus or have to care for children while schools are
closed. Iowa has [an online
form](https://www.iowaworkforcedevelopment.gov/job-offer-decline-form-employers)
for “employers to report unemployed claimants who have refused
legitimate job offers.”

Sarah Parker, 26, a customer service manager at a store in Chillicothe,
Ohio, was asked by her employer last week to prepare to return to work
in a small shopping
center.

She estimates that her new paycheck will be half of the roughly $800 a
week that she received in government aid, but said she did not want to
subsist on benefit payments.

After the pandemic grabbed hold in March, Washington began sending
$1,200 stimulus checks to most households. Congress also enacted
emergency benefits that expanded unemployment insurance to gig workers
and others not covered under state programs, and provided a weekly
supplement of $600 through July. To help laid-off workers who exhausted
their state benefits, the government extended unemployment insurance for
13 weeks.

For many low-wage workers who applied successfully, the additional $600
meant their [weekly income matched or even exceeded their regular
paycheck](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/23/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-stimulus-coronavirus.html).
Many would prefer to wait for the health risks to recede but fear losing
their benefits.

Kelty Stanton, an 18-year-old community college student, said that she
was happy to be asked to return to her job next week at a restaurant and
grocery near Titusville, N.J., but that she was stunned when she read an
email outlining the
terms.

“I’m relieved that I have a job again,” Ms. Stanton said, “but at the

Some employers are asking returning workers to sign
[waivers](https://twitter.com/Gilly0n/status/1258873334827061248?s=20)
absolving companies of liability if their workers get sick.

A survey released last week by the National Federation of Independent
Business, a trade group that has often supported lower taxes and
deregulation, found that 68 percent of small-business owners were
worried about increased liability claims if they reopened.

This week, social media users [shared a
letter](https://twitter.com/Gilly0n/status/1258873334827061248?s=20)
from the Las Vegas restaurant chain [Nacho
Daddy](https://twitter.com/tripple_OD/status/1259698602185764865?s=20)
that asked returning employees to promise not to take legal action if
they contracted the virus at work.
