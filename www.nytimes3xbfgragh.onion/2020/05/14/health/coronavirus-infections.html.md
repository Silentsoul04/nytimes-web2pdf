Coughs or sneezes may not be the only way people transmit infectious
pathogens like the novel coronavirus to one another. Talking can also
launch thousands of droplets so small they can remain suspended in the
air for eight to 14 minutes, according to a new
[study](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-study.html).

The research, published Wednesday in [The Proceedings of the National
Academy of
Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/05/12/2006874117),
could help explain how people with mild or no symptoms may infect others
in close quarters such as offices, nursing homes, cruise ships and other
confined spaces. The study’s experimental conditions will need to be
replicated in more real-world circumstances, and researchers still don’t
know how much virus has to be transmitted from one person to another to
cause infection. But its findings strengthen the case for wearing masks
and taking other precautions in such environments to reduce the spread
of the coronavirus.

Scientists agree that the coronavirus jumps from person to person most
often by hitching a ride inside tiny respiratory droplets. These
droplets tend to fall to the ground within a few feet of the person who
emits them. They may [land on
surfaces](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-surfaces-aerosols.html)
like doorknobs, where people can touch lingering virus particles and
transfer them to their face. But some droplets can remain aloft, and be
inhaled by others.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Elaborate experiments have revealed how coughing or sneezing can produce
a crackling burst of air mixed with saliva or mucus that can force
hundreds of millions of influenza and other virus particles into the air
if a person is sick. A single cough can propel about 3,000 respiratory
droplets, while sneezing can generate [as many
as 40,000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7132666/).

To see how many droplets are produced during normal conversation,
researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases and the University of Pennsylvania, who study the
kinetics of biological molecules inside the human body, asked volunteers
to repeat the words “stay healthy” several times. While the participants
spoke into the open end of a cardboard box, the researchers illuminated
its inside with green lasers, and tracked bursts of droplets produced by
the speaker.

The laser scans showed that about 2,600 small droplets were produced per
second while talking. When researchers projected the amount and size of
droplets produced at different volumes based on previous studies, they
found that speaking louder could generate larger droplets, as well as
greater quantities of
them.

Although the scientists did not record speech droplets produced by
people who were sick, [previous
studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2196-x) have
calculated exactly how much coronavirus genetic material can be found in
oral fluids in the average patient. Based on this knowledge, the
researchers estimated that a single minute of loud speaking could
generate at least 1,000 virus-containing droplets.

The scientists also found that while droplets start shrinking from

in the air for eight to 14 minutes.

“These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that
normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined
environments,” the authors wrote in the study.

The researchers acknowledged that the experiment was performed in a
controlled environment with stagnant air that may not reflect what
happens in rooms with good ventilation. But they still had reason to
believe their reported values were “conservative lower limit estimates”
because some people have a higher viral load, meaning they may produce
droplets with several thousand more virus particles than average.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says keeping [at least
six feet
away](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html)
from others can help people avoid contact with respiratory droplets and
lower the risk of infection. But many scientists have argued that
droplets can travel farther than six feet, depending on the force with
which droplets are launched, the surrounding temperature, whether there
are air currents that can carry them farther and other
conditions.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

There is also debate about whether the coronavirus can also be
transmitted through even smaller droplets — less than a tenth the width
of a human hair — that are known as aerosols, and can remain suspended
or travel through the air for longer.

[In another recent
study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800), the same
authors showed that just articulating certain sounds can produce
significantly higher amounts of respiratory particles. The “th” sound in
the word “healthy,” for example, was a very efficient generator of
speech droplets. [Another
paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227699),
published in January by researchers from the University of California,
Davis, found the vowel sound “e” in “need” produces more droplets than
the “a” in “saw,” or “o” in “mood.”

What researchers don’t yet know is whether all speech, cough and sneeze
droplets carrying virus particles are equally infectious, or if a
specific amount of virus needs to be transmitted for a person to get
sick by breathing it in.

But the new study adds to the case for maintaining a physical distance
from other people to help slow the spread of coronavirus, said Linsey
Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia
Tech who was not involved with the paper.

“Based on this and other evidence, it would be wise to avoid extended
face-to-face conversations with other people unless you are far apart
and in a well-ventilated space, including outdoors,” Dr. Marr said.

The study also highlights the importance of wearing masks during social
and other interactions.

“The risk of talking to one another will probably be lower than being
exposed to a person who is not wearing a mask and openly coughs and
sneezes,” said Dr. Werner E. Bischoff, the medical director of infection
prevention and health system epidemiology at the Wake Forest School of
Medicine. “Normal talking to a person while keeping the recommended
social distance will be fine. Putting on a mask will be even better.”
