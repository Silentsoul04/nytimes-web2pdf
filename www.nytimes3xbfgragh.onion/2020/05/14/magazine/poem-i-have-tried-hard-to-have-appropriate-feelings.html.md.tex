Susan Leslie Moore's poem from ``That Place Where You Opened Your
Hands'' instantly offers forthright presence: a personal voice making
honest admissions. It's a poem that opens hands and heart to a reader
--- no double talk or cryptic shadings. Including a turn on a familiar
song line, a spatial obsession and that disquieting image of stranded
polar bears, then the very original cure of being ``kept in line'' by
something familiar outside the window, this poem suits our time of
roller-coastering moods. \emph{Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye}

\emph{By Susan Leslie Moore}

I have folded them away like sweaters.\\
Kept my distance from the moon, visited the sick.

I am proud of the life in my head. Nobody knows\\
the garden I've seen. I am tender with the suburb.

Some days even the ceiling worries me, the way\\
it keeps the roof on.

I only cry when the polar bears get to me.\\
The ones stranded on the melting ice.

Otherwise I'm kept in line by the steady curve\\
of my driveway, the tight fists of the roses. I can easily\\
 converse\\
about the sweet peas and our eventual disintegration.

The sky has more to say to me than I could\\
ever hear, given the restricted space between\\
houses. Frogs sing at night and the whine of the train.
