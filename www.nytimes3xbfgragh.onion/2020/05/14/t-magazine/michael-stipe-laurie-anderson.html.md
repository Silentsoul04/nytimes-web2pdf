At 72, no one would fault [Laurie
Anderson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/laurie-anderson),
the avant-garde multimedia icon — an inventor, performance artist,
musician, writer, filmmaker, painter and more — for being nostalgic. She
is best known for her 1981 surprise hit song, “[O
Superman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkfpi2H8tOE),” a visionary
tirade against American imperialism, built on looped vocal effects that
seemed to predict the next three decades or so of pop music. In recent
years, Anderson has been moonlighting as an archivist, shaping the
legacy of her husband and collaborator, [Lou
Reed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/lou-reed), who
[died
in 2013](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/10/28/arts/music/lou-reed-dies-at-71.html).
(His archives, which include letters, photographs and recordings, are
now [housed at](https://www.nypl.org/loureed) the New York Public
Library for the Performing Arts and are available to anyone with a
library card.) But the experience of looking backward, immersed in
another’s oeuvre, has only made Anderson’s own work more
forward-looking.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

From her dead dog and Guantánamo Bay to Tibetan Buddhism and the moon,
and from virtual reality to recorded music to oil on canvas, Anderson
finds inspiration from and expression in a wide range of subjects and
mediums, as she has since she began her career as a performance artist
in early 1970s New York. As the music critic John Rockwell
[wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1988/07/23/arts/review-pop-laurie-anderson-returns.html)
in The Times in 1988, “She didn’t so much emerge on the scene as create
it.” Anderson’s [upcoming
exhibition](https://hirshhorn.si.edu/exhibitions/laurie-anderson-the-weather/)
at the Smithsonian’s [Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/05/arts/design/hirshhorn-museum-and-sculpture-garden-goes-international.html)
in Washington, D.C. has been postponed, but when it does open it will
consist mostly of new work, including wall-size paintings that she
warned last November were still works in progress. (“They are really
bad,” she deadpanned.) Worrying about her own legacy, she added, is just
a waste of time.

For [Michael
Stipe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/08/14/t-magazine/my-10-favorite-books-michael-stipe.html),
however, the past has become a preoccupation of late. The 60-year-old
singer and songwriter fronted R.E.M. for more than three decades, from
1980 until [their
breakup](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/09/22/arts/music/rem-breaks-up-after-31-years-as-a-band.html)
in 2011, and the band has been reissuing some of its classic 1990s
albums, including “Automatic for the People” and “Monster,” while at the
same time revisiting live recordings and concert footage. But Stipe has
also largely moved on from music, concentrating instead on art and
photography (his most recent work is gathered in his 2019 monograph
“[Our Interference Times: A Visual
Record](https://www.damianieditore.com/en-US/product/735)”).

Anderson and Stipe met for a conversation in a photo studio on the
Bowery this past November to discuss their current projects, their early

**Laurie Anderson:** What are you making now?

**Michael Stipe:** When I first started talking about stuff that I was
making that wasn’t music, I said sculpture, because I wanted people to
imagine something tangible that you could hold. The truth is, I wasn’t
really making sculpture, I was just making things, and a lot of it is
photo-based. The book is an extension of that.

**LA:** Weren’t you doing that as a songwriter, making people imagine
things? I mean, in sculpture, you actually make things that people can
hold. Imagining it is even wilder. That’s what I love about the art —
nothing’s there. There’s not even a fence. There’s nothing. I love it.

**MS:** “O Superman” was my introduction to you. I was surrounded by art
students \[Stipe studied art at the University of Georgia before
dropping out soon after R.E.M. formed\] who said, “This is a new day.” I
have to say, the work that came after it was, for me, more enthralling,
but in terms of really throwing down the gauntlet sonically, that song
was like —

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**LA:** I just do wonder why more people didn’t do stuff like that. More
political or more electronic.

**MS:** Music now is post-hip-hop, which is really interesting to me,
because hip-hop came from the same culture as punk rock, and then has
this whole other aspect to it because it’s coming from black America.

**LA:** It has more language than punk rock, though. Although you used a
lot of language in your early things, and that’s what I loved about it:
unfurling words.

**MS:** I was a vulnerable man. I’m so proud that I never pretended to
be something I wasn’t, even before I spoke publicly about my sexuality
\[Stipe came out in 1994\]. Vulnerability and sensitivity in a public
figure and as a man was something that in my generation was not common
at all.

**LA:** A friend of mine just sent me a video of Lou when he was talking
about what it was like to be Lou and not be anybody else. The interview
ended with this amazing sentence, about how he felt about his efforts as
a writer. He said, “I’ve always been true to him.”

**MS:** That’s so beautiful and true. He allowed immense vulnerability
as a writer. But then he was kind of curmudgeonly as a person, or he
could be. He did not suffer fools gladly, and he made that abundantly
clear in the most beautiful way.

**LA:** Doing the archive was a really exciting thing for me. My idea
from the very beginning was to let anyone come in. You didn’t have to
have white gloves or be a scholar. And I’m so proud of that. I’m still
giving things away — I have endless things to give away. Actually, you
would fit in Lou’s jackets. I’ve got to give you some.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**LA:** Would you call what you were writing pop songs?

**MS:** The one time I met
[Warhol](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/andy-warhol) he
told me, “You’re a pop star.” And I said, “I’m a singer in a band.” And
he insisted that I was a pop star, and finally a few years later, I was
like, “Well, he was actually right.” I was a pop star all along. And
it’s something I didn’t mind at all. There’s nothing reluctant about
being a pop star, I don’t think, for either one of us. It was really
fun. I liked being a pop star.

**LA:** Oh, I was not a pop star. Maybe for four seconds.

**MS:** But those were four very important seconds.

**LA:** I approached it as an anthropologist. I was so observant. It was
always absurd to me. But I decided, “This is going to be fun.” And it
*was* fun. I didn’t think I deserved it, or wanted more of it. In fact,
it was horrible in other ways.

**MS:** It’s also grueling work. You’ve got to work to put out good
work.

**LA:** So what’s radical now?

**MS:** Radical now might be what’s mainstream, in fact. So, it’s
[Billie
Eilish](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/28/arts/music/billie-eilish-debut-album.html),
it’s music that has been formed by the algorithms that are [dictating
what we listen
to](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/23/business/media/stream-classical-music-spotify.html)
on the platforms that are available to us.

**LA:** I want a sense of groups, community, sweat, instead of bigger
and bigger things sold to bigger and bigger markets, which is what’s
going on now. Any time any big corporation — whether it’s Google or
Facebook or any cultural organization you can think of — decides to
monetize art or music or whatever, the first real buzzword they use is
“community”: “We love your community.” And then they buy it, they
brand it and they sell it back to you curated for a huge, expanded
audience of people with their cellphones.

**MS:** It’s been watered
down.

**LA:** How’d you choose New York?

**MS:** I first came to New York in 1979, as a teenager. It was all
about opportunity and possibility. It was really through the punk rock
scene and CBGB. It was [Patti
Smith](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/patti-smith) who
spoke of, or sang of, or wrote of — she did all of those, how about
that? — New York as a place of opportunity and possibility. I took that
very literally. I was like, “This is where I find myself.”

**LA:** Let’s say you were that age now, can you imagine coming to New
York?

**MS:** No.

**LA:** Where would you go?

**MS:** I’m trying to think of where my group of people would be in
2019. I’d have been born in 2000. My people would probably be obsessed
with somewhere in South America or somewhere like Porto, Portugal.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**LA:** I almost bought a sheep farm there. I used to have a hobby of
shopping for sheep farms: You’re on tour, it’s Sunday, there’s nothing
happening and you want to see the place, so you look through brochures.

**MS:** Did you really ever intend to buy a sheep farm, or was it just a
way to see the countryside?

**LA:** Initially, it was just a way to get someone to drive me around.
Then I found one near Porto. I was looking at brochures and said, “Oh,
sheep farm, $2,000.” I called the agent and said, “Is that a typo?” He
said, “It is. It’s $1,000.” So I said, “I’m going to get a sheep farm
for all my friends.” We went out there, now with the intention of buying
this. I think the thing that made me reconsider was he said, “You can
use all the prisoners here for labor because the prison is right over
there.” I said, “That’s handy.” There was no water or electricity or
anything like that, of course, which didn’t bother me. I didn’t have
that when I moved to New York. I had no roof. I was basically squatting.

**MS:** Are you a futurist?

**LA:** Oh, I aspire to be. Don’t you?

**MS:** Well, I like to surround myself with futurists. I like to hear
what they have to say.

**LA:** I was part of a group of futurists who were supposed to be
coming up with what people would be doing 20 years from now. With, oh
God, what’s his name, the co-founder of Microsoft? [Paul
Allen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/15/obituaries/paul-allen-dead.html).
I’d been on Paul’s boat and knew him a little bit. I thought, “What
would I do if I could not have to start from zero every time?” So I put
all of my stuff in a box — films, videos, websites, movies, records —
and I sent them to Paul Allen. I said, “I’m looking for a Medici.” He
called me up, said, “Let’s talk.” I’m a really proud person, so it’s
hard for me to actually ask people for things. So we were having this
beer in a bar and it crashed on the floor, all over his California white
pants. I was like, “Babe, your dream is over.” Anyway, he had this thing
called Interval Research, and he hired a hundred people to tell him what
people would be doing in the future. I was able to do a lot of things. I
formed a media company and we did a lot of big projects. He funded a lot
of the work. And it was a terrible mistake. Some artists are good at
opening the London office and becoming the mega this, mega something. I
just never had the ambition after
that.

I actually couldn’t care less. That’s not what’s important to me. What’s
important is love. That’s the only thing. The stuff? I really don’t
care. I’m happy with now. I’m trained as a Buddhist to think that’s all
there is. But it’s weird, I’m doing it obsessively in Lou’s case.

**MS:** There’s a deflection there.

**LA:** Maybe something like that. I couldn’t say no. But I might have
just burned out on the whole idea. After you do it so much, you’re like,
“Eh, I just want to make new things.” That’s why the Hirshhorn chose me.
There’s almost no old work in it. I wish there was. I actually have a
meeting today, and I want to say we should put something old in there,
but we’re making a lot of new stuff. It’s terrifying.

**MS:** Because you don’t know whether it’s going to be good work or
not?
