WASHINGTON — The Trump administration issued a new rule Friday that will
bar
[Huawei](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html)
and its suppliers from using American technology and software, a
significant escalation in the White House’s battle with the Chinese
telecom giant and one that is likely to inflame tensions with Beijing.

The rule change, which is slated to go into effect in September, will
block companies around the world from using American-made machinery and
software to design or produce chips for Huawei or its entities.
Companies can apply for a license to continue supplying those products,
but the administration said the presumption would be to deny those
requests.

John Neuffer, the president of the Semiconductor Industry Association,
which represents chip makers, said his group was concerned that the rule
would “create uncertainty and disruption for the global semiconductor
supply chain.” He added, however, that it appeared less damaging than
broader approaches the administration had previously considered.

The move appears aimed at inflicting further damage on Huawei, which
continues to rely on American-made machinery and software designs to
make the chips for its smartphones and tablets, as do the companies that
supply it. The Trump administration has singled out Huawei as a threat
to national security, saying its gear should not be trusted because it
is [beholden to the Chinese
government](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/11/us/politics/white-house-huawei-back-door.html),
an accusation the [company has
denied](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/15/technology/huawei-ren-zhengfei.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The measure is the latest of several restrictions taken against Huawei
in the last year. The administration added Huawei to an “entity list”
last May, barring exports of American products to the company and 114 of
its affiliates unless suppliers had first obtained a license.

After that rule was imposed, Huawei took steps to reduce its reliance on
American chip manufacturers like Qualcomm and ramp up its in-house
production through a chip unit, HiSilicon.

But HiSilicon still relies on outside manufacturers, including the
Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or
S.M.I.C., and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or
T.S.M.C., to mass-produce chips to its specifications. Many of those
operations rely to some extent on technology that was developed and
refined in the United States, where the semiconductor industry
began.

In a statement on Friday, the Commerce Department said Huawei had tried
to “undermine” its previous restrictions by using American software and
technology to make its own semiconductors, and buying products from
foreign foundries that used American equipment.

“There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei
has been able, in effect, to use U.S. technology with foreign fab
producers,” Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, [said in an
interview](https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6156862016001/#sp=show-clips)
Friday morning on Fox Business Network. He said the changes announced
Friday were tailored moves “to try to correct that loophole and make
sure that the American fab foundries are competing on an equal footing
with the foreign ones.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The measure could weigh on major chip contract manufacturers that sell
to Huawei, particularly S.M.I.C. and T.S.M.C., which rely heavily on
American manufacturing tools. It may also clamp down on sales by makers
of semiconductor equipment, like Applied Materials, KLA and Lam
Research, as well as chip design software companies.

The move comes at a moment of heightened tensions between the United
States and China. President Trump has blamed China for not doing enough
to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has suggested that the United
States [may punish the Chinese
government](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/us/politics/coronavirus-china-trump.html).
He has also begun [threatening to scrap the trade
deal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/business/us-china-trade-coronavirus.html)
the two countries signed in January.

“This came from China,” Mr. Trump said at a White House event to discuss
a vaccine on Friday. “It should have been stopped in China before it got
out to the world.”

The administration’s new measure against Huawei, one of China’s biggest
technology companies and a crown jewel of Chinese innovation, could
prompt a backlash against American technology companies that depend on
sales to China, such as Qualcomm and Apple.

On Friday evening, the English edition of the Chinese state-controlled
newspaper Global Times [cited an unnamed
source](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188491.shtml) who said the
Chinese government was ready to retaliate.

“Based on what I know, if the U.S. further blocks key technology supply
to Huawei, China will activate the ‘unreliable entity list,’ restrict or
investigate U.S. companies such as Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple, and
suspend the purchase of Boeing airplanes,” Hu Xijin, the editor in chief
of the Global Times, [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1261250635371909120).

In a call with reporters on Friday, a State Department official
enumerated the United States’ broad concerns about Huawei, including
that it had violated American sanctions on Iran and helped the Chinese
government construct a surveillance network within China and abroad.
Huawei is key to the Chinese government’s broad strategy of “civil
military fusion” that supports the Communist Party’s global ambitions,
the official said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, called the rule change “long
overdue.”

“The United States needs to strangle Huawei,” he said in a statement.
“Modern wars are fought with semiconductors, and we were letting
Huawei use our American designs. This is pretty simple: Chip companies
that depend on American technology can’t jump into bed with the Chinese
Communist Party.”

Huawei had no immediate comment.

On Thursday night, T.S.M.C. said it had [agreed to
build](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/technology/trump-tsmc-us-chip-facility.html)
a $12 billion factory in Arizona, in response to the Trump
administration’s growing concerns about the security of the global
electronics supply chain. The twin announcements raised speculation that
T.S.M.C. might have obtained some kind of assurance that at least a
portion of its sales to Huawei would be exempted from the new ban. While
the bulk of T.S.M.C.’s revenue is from American companies, HiSilicon
accounted for 14 percent of its revenue in the first quarter and is the
company’s fastest-growing client, said Paul Triolo, an industry analyst
at Eurasia Group.

Keith Krach, the under secretary for economic growth, energy and the
environment at the State Department, said Friday that T.S.M.C. had been
given “no assurances” that it would be exempt from the measure. A
Commerce Department official said the agency did not comment on
individual license decisions.

A T.S.M.C. spokeswoman said the factory decision was based on its
business needs, not part of any negotiation for eased trade sanctions.

In a statement early Friday, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo said
the deal would increase American economic independence from China and
strengthen the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, a self-governing island
claimed by Beijing.

Also on Friday morning, the Commerce Department extended for another 90
days a license that has allowed American companies to continue doing
business with Huawei temporarily. It warned that this would be the final
extension.
