Kathy Su and Eric Paul Schultz were married May 16 in Mesa, Ariz. Wade
R. Swanson, a cousin of the groom and a Universal Life minister,
officiated in the backyard of his home.

The couple lives in New York but bought one-way tickets to Mesa on March
28 to shelter in place at the winter home of the groom's parents. They
had originally planned to get married the same weekend, but at Maritime
Parc, a restaurant and events space in Jersey City, N.J.

Ms. Su, 32, is a senior product marketing manager at Amgen, a
pharmaceutical company in Berkeley Heights, N.J. She graduated from
M.I.T.

She is a daughter of Ru Huang and Xinhua Xu of Ellicott City, Md. Her
father is a technical consultant for software management at Sunovion, a
pharmaceutical company; he works from a home office. Her mother is a
Chinese language teacher in the Baltimore County public schools.

Up until March 2019, Mr. Schultz, 37, was a vice president for
acquisitions in the New York office of Shorenstein Properties, a real
estate investment firm. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin
and received an M.B.A. from Northwestern.

He is a son of Dori E. Schultz and Ken D. Schultz of Waukesha, Wis. His
parents retired as the owners of a State Farm insurance agency in West
Allis, Wis.

The couple met in 2017 through the dating website OkCupid, and had their
first date at a whiskey bar in New York.
