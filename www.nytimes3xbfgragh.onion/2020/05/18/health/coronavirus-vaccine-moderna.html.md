The first [coronavirus

to be tested in people appears to be safe and able to stimulate an
immune response against the infection, the manufacturer,
[Moderna](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html),
announced on Monday, offering a glint of hope to a world desperate for
ways to stop the pandemic.

The preliminary findings, in the first eight people who each received
two doses of the experimental
[vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/science/coronavirus-vaccine-horseshoe-crabs.html),
must now be repeated in far larger tests in hundreds and then thousands
of people, to find out if the vaccine can work in the real world.
Moderna’s technology, involving genetic material from the virus called
mRNA, is relatively new and has yet to produce any approved vaccine.

The promising early news sent Moderna’s stock soaring by more than 25
percent on Monday afternoon and helped drive Wall Street to its best day
in six weeks. Stocks were also lifted by statements from the Federal
Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, that the central bank would continue to
support the economy and markets.

Trading on Monday had all of the characteristics of a rally focused on

stock benchmarks in Europe were 4 percent to 6 percent higher; and oil
prices also jumped. Among the best performers in the S\&P 500 were
travel-related companies, like United Airlines, Expedia Group and

With the weather warming and state after state starting to lift lockdown
restrictions, Americans are eager to regain their freedom to shop, go to
the beach and enjoy bars and restaurants. Still, more than 1,000 people
died most days last week in the United States.

Vaccines are now seen as the best and perhaps only hope of stopping or
even slowing a disease that has [sickened nearly five million people
worldwide,
killed 315,000](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)
and locked down entire countries, paralyzing their
economies.

Dozens of companies and universities are rushing to create coronavirus
vaccines, and human trials have already started for several
manufacturers, including
[Pfizer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html)
and its German partner BioNTech, the [Chinese company
CanSino](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/04/business/coronavirus-china-vaccine.html)
and the [University of Oxford, which is working with
AstraZeneca](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-update-oxford.html).

Experts agree that it is essential to develop multiple vaccines, because
the urgent global need for [billions of doses will far outstrip the
production
capacity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-vaccine-supplies.html)
of any one manufacturer. But there is widespread concern among
scientists that haste could compromise safety, resulting in a vaccine
that does not work or even harms patients.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The potential strength of Moderna’s mRNA approach to vaccine making is
that it uses a genetic framework that can be quickly adapted for each
new viral threat. The company has said that it is proceeding on an
accelerated timetable, with a second phase of tests involving 600 people
to begin soon, and a third phase to begin in July involving thousands of
healthy people. The [Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna the
go-ahead](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna.html)
this month for the second phase.

If those trials go well, some doses of a vaccine could become available
for widespread use by the end of this year or early 2021, Dr. Tal Zaks,
Moderna’s chief medical officer, said in an interview. “We’re doing our
best to make it as many millions as possible.”

President Trump said last week that a vaccine would be available before
the end of this year. His prediction was supported by Moncef Slaoui, the
newly appointed leader of Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s
effort to speed vaccine development. At a briefing last week, Mr.
Slaoui, a former member of Moderna’s board of directors who resigned
when he took up his new government post, said he had seen preliminary
research data that convinced him that a vaccine could be created by the
end of the year. He did not identify the data.

Also on Monday, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of
Health and Human Services, confirmed that Mr. Slaoui would divest his
Moderna stock options, valued at about $10 million, on Tuesday morning.
Ms. Oakley added that Mr. Slaoui would donate to cancer research the
increased value his shares had accrued from last Thursday until
Tuesday’s sale. The share price closed at $80 on Monday, up from
$64.56 last Thursday, adding $2.4 million to the value of his options.

At a round table with restaurant executives at the White House on
Monday, Mr. Trump said, “This was a very big day, cure wise and vaccine
wise,” and noted that the markets were lifted by drug news.

Moderna produced the vaccine in collaboration with the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the institute that is
headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci and has been leading the clinical trials.
Part of the National Institutes of Health, the agency is involved in
research on other experimental coronavirus vaccines. Moderna and Johnson
& Johnson have each received roughly half a billion dollars from the
U.S. government, to speed development of a vaccine.

The people vaccinated in Moderna’s Phase 1 study described on Monday
were healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55. Their immune systems made
antibodies that were then tested in infected cells in the lab, and were
able to stop the virus from replicating — the key requirement for an
effective vaccine. The levels of those so-called neutralizing antibodies
matched or exceeded the levels found in patients who had recovered after
contracting the virus in the community.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Mark J. Mulligan, director of the N.Y.U. Langone Vaccine Center,
called the Moderna findings “very encouraging.” He added, “It’s a small
number of participants, but it appears to be a really good start.” Dr.
Mulligan was not involved in the early testing but expected to
participate in a later phase of the Moderna vaccine research.

Moderna’s early stage of testing, Phase 1, is continuing, Two more age
groups — 55 to 70 and 71 and over — are now being enrolled to test the
vaccine. The company did not mention plans to include children in its
studies and did not respond to an inquiry about it in time for
publication. But Dr. Mulligan said that tests in children were often
delayed until a vaccine was shown to be safe in young adults.

The actual data from the preliminary tests has not been published or
shared publicly, but has been submitted to the Food and Drug
Administration, which does not comment on trials still in progress. The
company said it hoped to make data publicly available this
summer.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their

Two shots, four weeks apart, are likely to be needed, meaning that
however many doses are produced, only half that number of people can be
vaccinated.

Moderna said that additional tests in mice that were vaccinated and then
infected found that the vaccine could prevent the virus from replicating
in their lungs, and that the animals had levels of neutralizing
antibodies comparable to those in the people who had received the
vaccine.

Three doses of the vaccine were tested: low, medium and high. These
initial results are based on tests of the low and medium doses. The only
adverse effects at those doses were redness and soreness in one
patient’s arm where the shot was given.

But at the highest dose, three patients had fever, muscle pains and
headaches, Dr. Zaks said, adding that the symptoms went away after a
day.

But the high dose is being eliminated from future studies, not so much
because of the side effects, but because the lower doses appear to work
so well that the high dose is not needed.

“The lower the dose, the more vaccine we’ll be able to make,” Dr. Zaks
said.

He added, “Demand is going to far outstrip supply so I think there is an
ethical obligation to go with the lowest dose you can so you can make as
much vaccine as possible.”

The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., has a vaccine-making facility
nearby in Norwood, and recently announced a 10-year collaboration with
the Swiss contract drugmaker Lonza to manufacture [up to one billion
doses a
year](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/moderna-and-switzerlands-lonza-strike-a-deal-on-a-potential-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
for worldwide distribution, if the vaccine proves successful. Dr. Zaks
said Moderna was also working with other vaccine makers in the United
States to scale up production.

Moderna uses genetic material — messenger RNA — to make vaccines, and
the company has nine others in various stages of development, including
several for viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. But no vaccine
made with this technology has yet reached the market.

Work on the new coronavirus started in January, as soon as Chinese
scientists posted its genetic sequence on the internet. Researchers at
Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
identified part of the sequence that codes for [a spikelike protein on
the surface of the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/11/science/how-coronavirus-hijacks-your-cells.html)
that attaches to human cells, helping the virus to invade them.

The idea behind Moderna’s vaccine is to inject the mRNA for part of the
spike protein and have it slip into the cells of a healthy person, which
then follow its instruction and crank out the viral protein. That
protein should act as a red flag for the immune system, stimulating it
to produce antibodies that will prevent infection by blocking the action
of the spike if the person is exposed to the virus.

“The new technologies for genetic immunization are rapid and produce a
product that is highly potent at producing immune responses,” Dr.
Mulligan said. “Today’s RNA results confirm that there is great
potential.”
