Assembly}\label{us-china-feud-over-coronavirus-erupts-at-world-health-assembly}}

China's president pledged \$2 billion to fight the virus, a move the
United States criticized as an effort to head off scrutiny of its
handling of the pandemic.

A meeting of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-world-health-organization.html}{World
Health Organization} that was supposed to chart a path for the world to
combat the coronavirus pandemic instead on Monday turned into a showcase
for the escalating tensions between
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/world/asia/us-china-consulate.html}{China
and the United States} over the virus.

President Xi Jinping of China announced at the start of the forum that
Beijing would donate \$2 billion toward fighting the coronavirus and
dispatch doctors and medical supplies to Africa and other countries in
the developing world.

The contribution, to be spent over two years, amounts to more than twice
what the United States had been giving the global health agency before
President Trump cut off American funding last month, and it could
catapult China to the forefront of international efforts to contain a
disease that has claimed at least 315,000 lives.

But it was also seen --- particularly by American officials --- as an
attempt by China to forestall closer scrutiny of whether it hid
information about the outbreak to the world.

Mr. Xi made his
\href{https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188716.shtml}{announcement} by
videoconference to the World Health Assembly, an annual decision-making
meeting of the W.H.O. that is being conducted virtually this year
because of safety considerations during the pandemic. Mr. Trump declined
to address the two-day gathering, providing the Chinese president an
opening to be one of the first world leaders to address the 194 member
states.

``In China, after making painstaking efforts and sacrifice, we have
turned the tide on the virus and protected lives,'' Mr. Xi said. ``We
have done everything in our power to support and assist countries in
need.''

Late Monday, Mr. Trump responded in
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262577580718395393}{a
scathing letter} in which he accused the W.H.O. of an ``alarming''
dependence on China. In the letter, addressed to the W.H.O.'s director
general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and posted on Twitter at 10:55
p.m., the president said, ``It is clear the repeated missteps by you and
your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely
costly for the world.''

The four-page letter details Mr. Trump's grievances against China and
the W.H.O. over the pandemic and ends with a threat to permanently pull
U.S. funding and revoke American membership in the organization if it
does not ``commit to substantive improvements within the next 30 days.''

Though the president did not specify the changes he was seeking, he said
that ``the only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it
can actually demonstrate independence from China.''

Earlier, Trump administration officials denounced China's aid
announcement as an attempt to influence the W.H.O., which is facing
pressure from member states to investigate whether it was complicit in
Beijing's lack of transparency in the early days of the outbreak in
Wuhan.

China's ``commitment of \$2 billion is a token to distract from calls
from a growing number of nations demanding accountability for the
Chinese government's failure to meet its obligations under international
health regulations to tell the truth and warn the world of what was
coming,'' John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
said in a statement. ``As the source of the outbreak, China has a
special responsibility to pay more and to give more.''

Other world leaders, in their remarks to the assembly, criticized the
lack of unity in fighting the pandemic and, without naming any one
country, urged nations to set aside their differences.

``No country can solve this problem alone,'' Chancellor Angela Merkel of
Germany said. ``We must work together.''

Dr. Tedros nodded to criticism of the organization's own handling of the
early weeks of the outbreak, saying the agency would review ``lessons
learned'' about its global response.

But he did not address Mr. Trump's insistence that the health agency
investigate allegations widely dismissed by scientists that the
coronavirus originated in a lab in China. Mr. Xi in his speech called
for any examination to take place after the health crisis had subsided.

In recent weeks, Chinese leaders and citizens have become increasingly
aware of the international criticism and open hostility over China's
initial handling of the outbreak. Top American officials have been
scathing, but European leaders have also spoken of mysteries surrounding
the outbreak in China that needed to be addressed.

China's aggressive diplomacy and international anger over exports of
Chinese-made medical equipment that turned out to be shoddy have also
contributed to the rising tensions.

About 100 nations have called for an independent investigation into the
origins of the pandemic.

Against that backdrop, and with the imminent start of the annual
National People's Congress in Beijing on Friday, Mr. Xi's move appeared
to be an effort to win over international support and calm the public
anxieties in China.

``Certainly this is a very tricky moment for Xi,'' said Dali L. Yang, a
political scientist at the University of Chicago. ``Clearly he doesn't
want this really to be hanging above him, given how many countries are
engaged and have asked for an investigation into the origins of the
virus.''

Mr. Trump's retreat from the global stage has created openings for
China, which has been seeking to reshape multilateral institutions long
dominated by Washington.

Ryan Hass, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution, said a familiar
pattern had emerged. ``Whenever Trump withdraws the U.S. from
international leadership, Xi announces that China will step forward,''
said Mr. Hass, who was a China director on President Barack Obama's
National Security Council. ``Xi has been ruthlessly opportunistic about
seeking to exploit America's withdrawal from global leadership for
China's advantage.''

Washington's weak diplomatic hand was apparent on Monday when its
efforts to lead a coalition of countries seeking to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/05/18/world/asia/ap-as-taiwan-world-health-assembly.html}{win
Taiwan admission} to the assembly as an observer failed. The
self-governed island, which Beijing claims as its own territory, had
observer status until 2016. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top
American officials had recently called on the W.H.O. and its members to
re-establish Taiwan's admission over Beijing's objections.

Mr. Trump's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-who-funding.html}{fury
at the W.H.O.}, and his decision last month to freeze financial
contributions to the group in the middle of a global pandemic, came as
critics pointed to his own administration's slow and bungled response to
a pandemic that has infected nearly 1.5 million people in the United
States and killed nearly 90,000.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/05/18/science/18VIRUS-WHO-CHINA2/merlin_172612236_032d10c5-7c0a-4c32-9d79-d091a2b4678d-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

To many of the president's supporters, the W.H.O. and other
international organizations are to blame for lost jobs, low wages and
economic uncertainty in the United States. But Mr. Trump will need to
convince a broad part of the electorate that he was not responsible for
the deaths and massive economic calamity caused by the virus. Casting
the W.H.O. and the Chinese government as enemies could be an effective
way, at least in the eyes of his supporters, for Mr. Trump to blunt
fierce criticism from Democrats over his failures on the pandemic.

``Why is it that China, for decades, and with a population much bigger
than ours, is paying a tiny fraction of \$'s to The World Health
Organization, The United Nations and, worst of all, The World Trade
Organization, where they are considered a so-called `developing country'
and are therefore given massive advantages over The United States, and
everyone else?'' Mr. Trump tweeted over the weekend.

Beijing contributed a total of \$86 million to the W.H.O. in 2018 and
2019, indeed much less than
\href{http://open.who.int/2018-19/contributors/contributor?name=United\%20States\%20of\%20America}{Washington's
\$893 million contribution} over those two years.
