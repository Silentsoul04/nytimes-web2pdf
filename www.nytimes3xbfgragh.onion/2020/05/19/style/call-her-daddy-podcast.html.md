In just two years, “Call Her Daddy,” a raunchy podcast about sex,
dating, culture and life in New York, became a cult sensation. This
week, it descended into a fireball of chaos and internet drama.

Two friends, Sofia Franklyn, 27, and Alexandra Cooper, 26, started the
show in 2018 after coming up with the idea over a vacation. The podcast
was acquired by Barstool Sports about a month after the first episode
aired and quickly began raking in hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

It jumped from [12,000 to two million downloads in just two
months](https://www.adexchanger.com/publishers/influencers-are-the-new-publishers-barstool-sports-ceo-erika-nardini/)
and topped the podcast charts. It is one of the top 20 most popular on
[Apple Podcasts](https://www.podcastinsights.com/top-us-podcasts/).

“They talk about things everyone can relate to, especially people in
college and their 20s,” said Addison Rose, 19, a college student and
longtime fan. “It’s interesting to hear sex talked about in such an
honest way from a women’s perspective. It was refreshing.”

Barstool

“Barstool liked our idea of uncensored, real, female locker room talk,
which quite frankly is just as nasty as guy locker room talk. And we had
no problem exploiting our experiences — as well as ourselves — for our
listeners’ entertainment.”

But in the past month, the “Call Her Daddy” empire has tumbled, exposing
the inevitable issues media companies face when their star employees
morph into powerful influencers.

“This controversy is starting to show some of the macro issues in the
media businesses built around these personalities,” said Blake Robbins,
a partner at Ludlow Ventures, a venture capital firm. “It’s the pull of
influencers outgrowing the media brands that invested in their careers.”

## An Uncertain Future

The last time anyone heard from the two “Call Her Daddy” hosts directly
was on April 8, when they uploaded an episode with the cryptic subtitle
“Kesha… The End.” Then, the podcast’s feed went dark.

Fans began tweeting the hashtag \#FreeTheFathers, speculating that the
hosts were being silenced by their parent company, Barstool Sports.
“Fathers” is an affectionate nickname given to the “Call Her Daddy”
hosts.

On April 21, Ms. Franklyn and Ms. Cooper posted a statement to Instagram
saying that they “legally can’t speak out yet” about what has been
taking place behind the scenes. (Neither Ms. Cooper nor Ms. Franklyn
responded to requests to comment for this article.) Tabloids [speculated
on a fallout between the
two](https://pagesix.com/2020/04/27/battle-brewing-between-barstool-sports-and-raunchy-hit-podcast-call-her-daddy/).
Fans [posted theories](https://twtext.com/article/1254463034522820610)
that they’d dropped hidden messages in the titles of recent episodes
indicating trouble.

On Sunday, the tension that had been quietly brewing for weeks boiled
over.

Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder and president, posted a
30-minute tell-all episode to the “Call Her Daddy” podcast feed, calling
Ms. Franklyn and Ms. Cooper “unprofessional, disloyal and greedy” before
revealing the full details of his side of the messy contract dispute.

According to Erika Nardini, the C.E.O. of Barstool, [more than 35
percent of Barstool’s
revenue](https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/barstool-sports-podcast-revenue-1203305912/)
now comes from the company’s podcast business, and “Call Her Daddy” was
a crown jewel. Mr. Portnoy said the company was losing $100,000 per
missed episode and said that he offered the hosts a guaranteed base
salary of $500,000 a year, plus bonuses, among other incentives that he
estimated would ultimately net them millions, to return to the show.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Cooper, he said, had agreed to the new terms, but Ms. Franklyn
refused, according to Mr. Portnoy, on the advice of her boyfriend, the
[HBO Sports executive Peter
Nelson](https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/what-to-know-about-peter-nelson-and-call-her-daddy-drama/),
referred to as “suitman” on the podcast. Mr. Nelson helped Ms. Franklyn
and Ms. Cooper shop the podcast around to other networks, according to
Mr. Portnoy.

On Tuesday, Mr. Portnoy announced new “Call Her Daddy” merch emblazoned
with the phrase “[cancel
suitman](https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1262390184613740544),”
alluding to Mr. Nelson. Fans lashed out at Mr. Nelson online for [coming
between the two
friends](https://twitter.com/knicks_tape99/status/1262412507060338689)
and “[ruining the
podcast](https://twitter.com/realitykiwi/status/1262209743478808576).”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, the future of the show is uncertain. According to Mr. Portnoy, Ms.
Cooper will likely return and take over “Call Her Daddy,” and an offer
is out to Ms. Franklyn. They might host competing podcasts, both on the
Barstool Network.

On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Franklyn addressed the controversy on
Instagram Stories. “Did Barstool help blow up ‘Call Her Daddy?’ 100
percent,” she said. But, that doesn’t mean she’ll be returning. “I found
out that Alex had gone behind my back and done something and I found out
that it wasn’t the first time. I’m willing to do ‘Call Her Daddy,’ I
really am. I can’t do it under the circumstances that she wants,” Ms.
Franklyn said.

In the meantime, thousands of fans have continued weighing in online.
Many have begged for a reconciliation. Others feel deeply betrayed.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In his tell-all, Mr. Portnoy said that Ms. Franklyn and Ms. Cooper had
each taken home nearly $500,000 last year, a figure far higher than many
fans imagined. “They’d frequently talk in the podcast about being broke
girls in their 20s, which is relatable,” Ms. Rose said. “Then it came
out how much they were making.”

“$500k a year to talk about sex once a week and that’s not good enough
for you? Imagine having it THAT easy.. feel betrayed as a fan tbh,”
[another fan
tweeted](https://twitter.com/ballerinaswifts/status/1262198053743853573).

## ‘People Expect Transparency’

Media companies have long acted as talent incubators, providing content
producers name-brand recognition and access to a larger audience. But,
as that talent builds a following on social media, the balance of power
shifts. Often, talent no longer needs the media company to operate as a
middleman, and many realize they could monetize their own platforms more
effectively by themselves.

“Even though this feels messy and salacious, it actually does touch on
much larger questions about media institutions and talent, and how they
create value and contracts with each other,” said Nicholas Quah, the
founder of Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts.

When “Call Her Daddy” started, Ms. Franklyn and Ms. Cooper were
relatively unknown. Now they have about one million followers on
Instagram each and wield a wide and loyal audience online. To Barstool
Sports, however, they were simply employees.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re entering a period where creators are business owners and media
brands of their own. They can’t just be seen as employees,” said Jordi
Hays, a digital strategist who works with online creators in Los
Angeles. “The tools are available to them to become founders and C.E.O.s
of their brand, and develop businesses with multiple powerful revenue
streams like merch, ad sales and subscription revenue.”

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This isn’t the first time high-profile internet creators decided their
media company wasn’t working for them anymore and decided to forge out
their own. In 2016, a slew of employees of BuzzFeed Video [left to
become full-time
YouTubers](https://whatstrending.com/trending-videos/trending-now/23343-why-do-creators-leave-buzzfeed/).
Scott Rogowsky went through [extensive complex contract
negotiations](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ceo-of-hq-the-hottest-app-going-if-you-run-this-profile-well-fire-our-host)
after HQ Trivia minted him as a star.

And Tfue, an elite Fortnite player, sued [FaZe
Clan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/15/style/faze-clan-house.html),
a gaming content collective, in 2019, to escape [what he considered an
exploitive
contract](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/why-tfues-lawsuit-against-faze-clan-matters/589900/).
“The time is now for content creators, gamers and streamers to stop
being taken advantage of through oppressive, unfair and illegal
agreements,” he [wrote in the
suit](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/why-tfues-lawsuit-against-faze-clan-matters/589900/).

While most traditional publishers and media brands would balk at
litigating a contract dispute in public, Mr. Portnoy and Barstool Sports
have proven themselves adept at leveraging online attention in their
favor.

“A lot of companies would try to sweep this under the rug and put out a
press release, but in this new world of media where these people are
huge personalities, people expect transparency,” Mr. Robbins said. “This
is a Barstool gold mine. They want these story lines. They can now
create these competing podcasts between the ‘Call Her Daddy’ hosts, and
I have no doubt that both would do really well.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That’s assuming both women would return. Grace Atwood, a lifestyle
influencer and co-host of the podcast “Bad on Paper,” said she could see
why they may not want to. “These girls have nearly one million
followers, they can make $10,000 or $20,000 for a single Instagram
post,” she said. “You can take that audience and do anything. You
could start a fashion label, you could start a spinoff podcast. If that
audience likes and trusts you, there’s literally endless things you can
do with it. Imagine getting to that level and then taking a $75,000
salary.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Emma Gray, a host of “Here to Make Friends,” a podcast about “The
Bachelor,” owned by HuffPost, said that she has loved the production,
sales and support HuffPost has offered since she teamed with the company
five years ago to start her show.

Still, “we all know that followers are literal capital at this point,”
she said. “I think it’s important for media companies to treat their
podcast hosts as talent and therefore use talent contracts in their
negotiations rather than a general employment agreement.”

For talent negotiations, there’s no better person to have on your side
than an experienced talent agent or a lawyer. Quinn Heraty, the founder
of Heraty Law, has worked extensively with podcasters. Ms. Heraty said
that she encourages nearly all hosts to go independent. “Being an
employee is just working to create value for someone else,” she said.

But for those who do take a deal with a more established media brand,
the important thing is to negotiate equitable terms from the beginning.
“When you have a deal that’s inherently more favorable to one side or
another, that’s going to, over the course of the deal, cause stress on
the relationship,” she said. “Deals change over the lifetime of a
business relationship because these dynamics are dynamic.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The systems for monetization are also increasingly complex. Most
aspiring podcasters don’t think of negotiating things like ownership of
their back catalog, licensing agreements, platform exclusivity,
intellectual property and more, upfront. “The deal making is only
becoming more complex,” said Oren Rosenbaum, the head of emerging
platforms at United Talent Agency. And, “we’re still on the ground
floor. We’re still in the infancy of this business.”

No matter how the situation with “Call Her Daddy” resolves, these
conflicts won’t go away as long as the traditional media ecosystem
remains in flux. But fans and those in the online creator industry are
rapt.

“This is one of the first times in this new personality-driven media
world that we’ve gotten insight into how the contracts are actually
structured,” Mr. Robbins said. “Dave and Barstool clearly do bring
something to the table, because they’re making this one of the most
talked-about things in pop culture.”
