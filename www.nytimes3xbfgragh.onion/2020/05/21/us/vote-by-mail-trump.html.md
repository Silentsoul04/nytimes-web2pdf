# As Trump Rails Against Voting by Mail, States Open the Door for It

Despite the president’s opposition, states are increasingly reducing
barriers to what many see as the safest way to vote amid the pandemic.

WASHINGTON — By threatening on Wednesday to [withhold federal grants to
Michigan and
Nevada](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-michigan-vote-by-mail.html)
if those states send absentee ballots or applications to voters,
President Trump has taken his latest stand against what is increasingly
viewed as a necessary option for voting amid a pandemic.

What he has not done is stop anyone from getting an absentee ballot.

In the face of a pandemic, what was already limited opposition to
letting [voters mail in their
ballots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/trump-mail-in-voting.html)
has withered. [Eleven of the 16
states](https://ballotpedia.org/Changes_to_absentee/mail-in_voting_procedures_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_\(COVID-19\)_pandemic,_2020)
that limit who can vote absentee have eased their election rules this
spring to let anyone cast an absentee ballot in upcoming primary
elections — and in some cases, in November as well. Another state,
Texas, is fighting a court order to do so.

Four of those 11 states are [mailing
ballot](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/us/politics/republicans-mail-voting-trump.html)
applications to registered voters, just as Michigan and Nevada are
doing. And that does not count [34 other states and the District of
Columbia](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/preparing-your-state-election-under-pandemic-conditions)
that already allow anyone to cast an absentee ballot, including five
states in which voting by mail is the preferred method by law.

“Every once in a while you get the president of the United States
popping up and screaming against
[vote-by-mail](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/us/politics/nyc-vote-by-mail.html),
but states and both political parties are organizing their people for
it,” said Michael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for
Justice at New York University. “It’s a bizarre cognitive dissonance.”

Many of the states that have relaxed their rules have done so only for
pending primary elections, leaving the possibility that they could
choose not to do so in November. But that is highly unlikely, said
Daniel A. Smith, a University of Florida political scientist and expert
on mail ballots.

“The horse is out of the barn whether it’s primaries or the general
election,” he said. “The optics are such that states will be under
enormous pressure to continue to allow mail voting in the fall.”

Even as the president has offered support for some groups of absentee
voters like older Americans and military serving abroad — and even as he
votes absentee himself — Mr. Trump has regularly warned with no factual
basis that allowing widespread voting by mail [was a recipe for election
theft](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-michigan-vote-by-mail.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage).
“You get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody’s living
room, signing ballots all over the place,” Mr. Trump said at a White
House briefing last month.

What little fraud that occurs is often committed by insiders, not
voters, and limiting mail balloting or enacting measures like ID laws
would not deter it. The latest example: Two local political figures
[pleaded guilty on
Thursday](https://www.inquirer.com/news/voter-fraud-philadelphia-ward-leader-judge-of-elections-domenick-demuro-guilty-plea-20200521.html)

Still, some conservative advocacy groups have embraced Mr. Trump’s view,
even [going to court to block the
expansion](https://truethevote.org/true-the-vote-continues-battle-to-protect-voters-in-nevada-and-virginia/)
of absentee balloting during the pandemic. Republican-controlled
legislatures in Louisiana and Oklahoma also have bridled at making
voting easier. More legal battles ahead of the November election seem
certain.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

But in many other states, governments controlled by each of the
political camps have moved in the other direction.

In lawsuits and elsewhere, voting-rights advocates and Democrats have
taken aim at state rules on voting that they see as discriminatory. In
Texas, a federal court ruled this week that a state regulation granting
blanket absentee-ballot privileges to voters over 65 — a not-uncommon
exception nationally — discriminated against younger voters.

Elsewhere, lawsuits have sought to expand a common exception allowing
absentee voting by people too sick to go to the polls. The goal is to
cover voters who fear catching the coronavirus while in line at a
polling place. A number of states have adopted that view, ruling that
voters who reasonably fear exposure to the virus have a right to vote
remotely.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Jocelyn Benson, the Democratic secretary of state in Michigan, said this
week that the state would mail applications for absentee ballots to all
7.7 million registered voters for both the August primary and the
November general election. The Legislature in deeply Republican South
Carolina expanded absentee voting rights last week as a lawsuit pressing
that cause lay before the state’s Supreme Court.

In West Virginia, the Republican secretary of state [sent absentee
ballot
applications](https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/More-room-for-voter-fraud-with-WVa-absentee-ballots-569763811.html)
last month to each of the state’s 1.2 million registered voters; so far,
nearly one in five has asked to vote absentee.

And in Kentucky, Republicans and Democrats agreed three weeks ago on [an
emergency
plan](https://governor.ky.gov/attachments/20200424_Executive-Order_2020-296_SOE-Relating-to-Elections.pdf)
that allows any voter to request an absentee ballot online and submit it
by mail or at drop-off points for two weeks before the state’s June 23
primary. Michael G. Adams, the Republican secretary of state, told
National Public Radio last week that he had been excoriated by his party
for [mailing postcards to
voters](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/15/856189149/it-s-partly-on-me-gop-official-says-fraud-warnings-hamper-vote-by-mail-push)
explaining the new rules.

“The biggest challenge I have right now is making the concept of
absentee voting less toxic for Republicans,” said Mr. Adams, who won
election on a platform underscoring the threat of voter fraud.

Many political analysts say they find that odd. Until now, the
decade-long crusade by Republicans against voter fraud has focused
largely on requiring ID cards at polling places, supposedly to counter
the distant possibility that an impersonator might make it into a voting
booth. Studies show that fraud among absentee voters, while still rare,
is more common — but that those voters have tended to be both older and
white, a demographic that favors Republicans and Mr. Trump.

“Before 2018, Republicans loved mail balloting,” Michael McDonald, a
University of Florida political science professor and elections expert,
said.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump said in March that Democrat-backed election proposals for
expanded voting by mail would ensure that “you’d never have a Republican
elected in this country again.” Indeed, many Republicans and Democrats
alike believe that expanding mail voting would increase Democratic
turnout.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Their reasoning is that many more absentee ballots have traditionally
been cast by wealthier and more educated voters and expanding voting by
mail would add more votes by the low-income and minority voters who tend
to lean Democratic and have a harder time getting to polls on Election
Day.

But both academic studies and changing demographics throw that into
question. Under Mr. Trump, the Republican base has shifted greatly
toward white people with less education, while wealthier suburbanites
have become increasingly Democratic. Studies in states that use voting
by mail indicate it does not favor either party.

And in any case, mail voting is increasingly the norm everywhere: In
2016, nearly one in four voters cast absentee or mail ballots, twice the
share in 2004.

Mr. McDonald and other experts argue that the greatest threat posed by a
shift to voting by mail has nothing to do with fraud. Rather, they say,
it is the very real prospect that a tsunami of mail votes could
overwhelm both postal workers and election officials, creating a snarl
in tallying and certifying votes that would allow a candidate to claim
that late-counted votes were fraudulent.

Mr. Trump’s unfounded assertions that mail balloting in Michigan and
Nevada encourage fraud suggest that he could be laying the ground for
such a scenario, said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the
University of California, Irvine.

“I think he’s trying to undermine confidence in elections,” Mr. Hasen
said. “Maybe he’s not being conscious about what he’s doing. But he’s
acting as if he has a plan.”
