It}\label{as-trump-rails-against-voting-by-mail-states-open-the-door-for-it}}

Despite the president's opposition, states are increasingly reducing
barriers to what many see as the safest way to vote amid the pandemic.

WASHINGTON --- By threatening on Wednesday to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-michigan-vote-by-mail.html}{withhold
federal grants to Michigan and Nevada} if those states send absentee
ballots or applications to voters, President Trump has taken his latest
stand against what is increasingly viewed as a necessary option for
voting amid a pandemic.

What he has not done is stop anyone from getting an absentee ballot.

In the face of a pandemic, what was already limited opposition to
letting
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/us/politics/trump-mail-in-voting.html}{voters
mail in their ballots} has withered.
\href{https://ballotpedia.org/Changes_to_absentee/mail-in_voting_procedures_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic,_2020}{Eleven
of the 16 states} that limit who can vote absentee have eased their
election rules this spring to let anyone cast an absentee ballot in
upcoming primary elections --- and in some cases, in November as well.
Another state, Texas, is fighting a court order to do so.

Four of those 11 states are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/us/politics/republicans-mail-voting-trump.html}{mailing
ballot} applications to registered voters, just as Michigan and Nevada
are doing. And that does not count
\href{https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/preparing-your-state-election-under-pandemic-conditions}{34
other states and the District of Columbia} that already allow anyone to
cast an absentee ballot, including five states in which voting by mail
is the preferred method by law.

``Every once in a while you get the president of the United States
popping up and screaming against
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/us/politics/nyc-vote-by-mail.html}{vote-by-mail},
but states and both political parties are organizing their people for
it,'' said Michael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for
Justice at New York University. ``It's a bizarre cognitive dissonance.''

Many of the states that have relaxed their rules have done so only for
pending primary elections, leaving the possibility that they could
choose not to do so in November. But that is highly unlikely, said
Daniel A. Smith, a University of Florida political scientist and expert
on mail ballots.

``The horse is out of the barn whether it's primaries or the general
election,'' he said. ``The optics are such that states will be under
enormous pressure to continue to allow mail voting in the fall.''

Even as the president has offered support for some groups of absentee
voters like older Americans and military serving abroad --- and even as
he votes absentee himself --- Mr. Trump has regularly warned with no
factual basis that allowing widespread voting by mail
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-michigan-vote-by-mail.html?action=click\&module=Spotlight\&pgtype=Homepage}{was
a recipe for election theft}. ``You get thousands and thousands of
people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the
place,'' Mr. Trump said at a White House briefing last month.

Despite
\href{https://vdocuments.mx/the-terre-haute-election-trial.html}{ballot
stuffing scandals in the nation's past,} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/18/us/north-carolina-election-fraud.html?action=click\&module=RelatedCoverage\&pgtype=Article\&region=Footer}{an

nothing remotely comparable has been documented in modern American
politics or linked to voting by mail.

What little fraud that occurs is often committed by insiders, not
voters, and limiting mail balloting or enacting measures like ID laws
would not deter it. The latest example: Two local political figures
\href{https://www.inquirer.com/news/voter-fraud-philadelphia-ward-leader-judge-of-elections-domenick-demuro-guilty-plea-20200521.html}{pleaded
guilty on Thursday} to accepting \$2,500 in bribes to stuff ballot boxes
in three Philadelphia judicial races.

Still, some conservative advocacy groups have embraced Mr. Trump's view,
even
\href{https://truethevote.org/true-the-vote-continues-battle-to-protect-voters-in-nevada-and-virginia/}{going
to court to block the expansion} of absentee balloting during the
pandemic. Republican-controlled legislatures in Louisiana and Oklahoma
also have bridled at making voting easier. More legal battles ahead of
the November election seem certain.

But in many other states, governments controlled by each of the
political camps have moved in the other direction.

In lawsuits and elsewhere, voting-rights advocates and Democrats have
taken aim at state rules on voting that they see as discriminatory. In
Texas, a federal court ruled this week that a state regulation granting
blanket absentee-ballot privileges to voters over 65 --- a not-uncommon
exception nationally --- discriminated against younger voters.

Elsewhere, lawsuits have sought to expand a common exception allowing
absentee voting by people too sick to go to the polls. The goal is to
cover voters who fear catching the coronavirus while in line at a
polling place. A number of states have adopted that view, ruling that
voters who reasonably fear exposure to the virus have a right to vote
remotely.

Jocelyn Benson, the Democratic secretary of state in Michigan, said this
week that the state would mail applications for absentee ballots to all
7.7 million registered voters for both the August primary and the
November general election. The Legislature in deeply Republican South
Carolina expanded absentee voting rights last week as a lawsuit pressing
that cause lay before the state's Supreme Court.

In West Virginia, the Republican secretary of state
\href{https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/More-room-for-voter-fraud-with-WVa-absentee-ballots-569763811.html}{sent
absentee ballot applications} last month to each of the state's 1.2
million registered voters; so far, nearly one in five has asked to vote
absentee.

And in Kentucky, Republicans and Democrats agreed three weeks ago on
\href{https://governor.ky.gov/attachments/20200424_Executive-Order_2020-296_SOE-Relating-to-Elections.pdf}{an
emergency plan} that allows any voter to request an absentee ballot
online and submit it by mail or at drop-off points for two weeks before
the state's June 23 primary. Michael G. Adams, the Republican secretary
of state, told National Public Radio last week that he had been
excoriated by his party for
\href{https://www.npr.org/2020/05/15/856189149/it-s-partly-on-me-gop-official-says-fraud-warnings-hamper-vote-by-mail-push}{mailing
postcards to voters} explaining the new rules.

``The biggest challenge I have right now is making the concept of
absentee voting less toxic for Republicans,'' said Mr. Adams, who won
election on a platform underscoring the threat of voter fraud.

Many political analysts say they find that odd. Until now, the
decade-long crusade by Republicans against voter fraud has focused
largely on requiring ID cards at polling places, supposedly to counter
the distant possibility that an impersonator might make it into a voting
booth. Studies show that fraud among absentee voters, while still rare,
is more common --- but that those voters have tended to be both older
and white, a demographic that favors Republicans and Mr. Trump.

``Before 2018, Republicans loved mail balloting,'' Michael McDonald, a
University of Florida political science professor and elections expert,
said.

Mr. Trump said in March that Democrat-backed election proposals for
expanded voting by mail would ensure that ``you'd never have a
Republican elected in this country again.'' Indeed, many Republicans and
Democrats alike believe that expanding mail voting would increase
Democratic turnout.

Their reasoning is that many more absentee ballots have traditionally
been cast by wealthier and more educated voters and expanding voting by
mail would add more votes by the low-income and minority voters who tend
to lean Democratic and have a harder time getting to polls on Election
Day.

But both academic studies and changing demographics throw that into
question. Under Mr. Trump, the Republican base has shifted greatly
toward white people with less education, while wealthier suburbanites
have become increasingly Democratic. Studies in states that use voting
by mail indicate it does not favor either party.

And in any case, mail voting is increasingly the norm everywhere: In
2016, nearly one in four voters cast absentee or mail ballots, twice the
share in 2004.

Mr. McDonald and other experts argue that the greatest threat posed by a
shift to voting by mail has nothing to do with fraud. Rather, they say,
it is the very real prospect that a tsunami of mail votes could
overwhelm both postal workers and election officials, creating a snarl
in tallying and certifying votes that would allow a candidate to claim
that late-counted votes were fraudulent.

Mr. Trump's unfounded assertions that mail balloting in Michigan and
Nevada encourage fraud suggest that he could be laying the ground for
such a scenario, said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the
University of California, Irvine.

``I think he's trying to undermine confidence in elections,'' Mr. Hasen
said. ``Maybe he's not being conscious about what he's doing. But he's
acting as if he has a plan.''
