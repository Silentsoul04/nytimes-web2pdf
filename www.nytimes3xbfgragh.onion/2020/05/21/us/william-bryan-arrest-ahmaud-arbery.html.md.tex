ATLANTA --- The man who filmed the pursuit and shooting death of Ahmaud
Arbery, the 25-year-old black man who was killed after an encounter with
two white men, was arrested on Thursday in connection with the killing,
Georgia authorities said.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that the man,
William Bryan, 50, was arrested on charges of felony murder and criminal
attempt to commit false imprisonment. The two other men, Gregory
McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, were
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-arrest.html}{charged
with murder and aggravated assault} this month.

Mr. Bryan, who is white, recorded the confrontation on Feb. 23 as the
McMichaels pursued Mr. Arbery while he was running through the Satilla
Shores neighborhood near Brunswick on the southeastern Georgia coast.

More than two months passed without arrests or criminal charges, and the
video,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/us/ahmaud-arbery-video-lawyer.html}{released
online this month}, has been credited with bringing a surge of attention
to the case and mobilizing activists. After the McMichaels were
arrested, pressure
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/us/ahmaud-arbery-william-bryan.html}{ratcheted
up for the authorities to arrest} Mr. Bryan, who is known as Roddie.

The half-minute video taken by Mr. Bryan, who also lives in the
neighborhood, shows Mr. Arbery running along a tree-lined street before
encountering the McMichaels, who are father and son.

In the recording, Mr. Arbery and Travis McMichael are seen tussling over
Mr. McMichael's shotgun as Mr. McMichael shoots three times. Mr. Arbery
then spins around, tries to run and falls to the pavement.

According to a police report, Gregory McMichael said that he saw Mr.
Arbery running through his neighborhood and thought he looked like the
suspect in a rash of nearby break-ins. The McMichaels maintain their
innocence, their lawyers said.

One of the case's early prosecutors had contended that the McMichaels'
actions did not constitute a criminal offense, citing statutes on
self-defense
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/ahmaud-arbery-citizen-arrest-law-georgia.html}{and
citizen's arrests}. But activists said the video was crucial in shining
a light on the case, and argued that Mr. Bryan had been more than a
bystander.

In a statement released on Thursday night, lawyers for Mr. Arbery's
family said they were ``relieved'' by the arrest.

``His involvement in the murder of Mr. Arbery was obvious to us, to many
around the country and after their thorough investigation, it was clear
to the G.B.I. as well,'' the statement said.

Kevin Gough, Mr. Bryan's lawyer, did not immediately respond to messages
seeking comment.

The G.B.I. said in a statement that Mr. Bryan was being held in the
Glynn County Jail, where the McMichaels are also being held as they
await a bond hearing.

Mr. Bryan was considered a participant in the pursuit long before the
video emerged online. He is mentioned in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/26/us/ahmed-arbery-shooting-georgia.html}{the
initial police report of the killing}, which was based largely on a
Glynn County police officer's interview with Gregory McMichael.

After
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-arrest.html}{arresting
the McMichaels} on May 7, the G.B.I. said Mr. Bryan was also a subject
of its investigation.

In a television interview last week, Mr. Bryan pointed out the role his
video had played in drawing notice to Mr. Arbery's death, and said he
was praying for his family.

``If there wasn't a tape, then we wouldn't know what happened,'' he
said. ``I hope that it, in the end, brings justice to the family and
peace to the family.''

Mr. Gough had said repeatedly in recent days that Mr. Bryan should not
be charged. In the same television interview, appearing alongside Mr.
Bryan on CNN, Mr. Gough blamed the McMichaels for the shooting,
asserting that Mr. Bryan lived nearby and was drawn by the commotion.

``This is a terrible matter and some people are going to have to answer
for what they did,'' Mr. Gough said. ``But my client is not responsible
for that.'' Mr. Bryan, he added, ``hasn't been in so much as a fistfight
since he was in high school.''

Then, on Monday night, Mr. Gough released a statement saying that Mr.
Bryan had taken a polygraph test that showed he was unarmed at the time
of the shooting and did not have a conversation with the McMichaels
before the pursuit.

``Without Roddie Bryan,'' Mr. Gough wrote, referring to Mr. Bryan by his
nickname, ``there would be no video of the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery.
Without that video there would be no case. Without purporting to speak
for the prosecution, as that would not be my place, we believe Mr. Bryan
is not just a witness for the prosecution but a key witness.''
