Taylor}\label{prosecutors-to-drop-charges-against-boyfriend-of-breonna-taylor}}

The announcement came one day after the Federal Bureau of Investigation
said it had opened an investigation into the fatal shooting of Ms.
Taylor by three police officers in Louisville, Ky.

Prosecutors on Friday said they were dropping charges against the
boyfriend of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/us/breonna-taylor-police-killing.html}{Breonna
Taylor}, a black woman who was fatally shot by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/us/brett-hankison-breonna-taylor-louisville.html}{three
white police officers in Louisville}, Ky., in March.

The announcement came one day after the Federal Bureau of Investigation
said it had
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/us/fbi-louisville-shooting.html}{opened
an investigation} into the shooting, which has drawn nationwide
attention.

``I believe that additional investigation is necessary,'' Thomas B.
Wine, the county prosecutor in Louisville, said at a news conference on
Friday. ``I believe that the independent investigation by the attorney
general's office in Kentucky, the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office
must be completed before we go forward with any prosecution of Kenneth
Walker.''

The authorities had charged Kenneth Walker, the boyfriend, with
attempted murder, saying he shot a Louisville police officer in the leg
when officers forced their way into Ms. Taylor's home during a narcotics
investigation at around 1 a.m.
\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/03/13/louisville-police-officer-shot-suspect-killed-springfield-drive/5040349002/}{on
March 13}.

Officers had knocked on the door several times and announced their
presence before using a ram to break down the door, the police said.
Officers were immediately met by gunfire, and fired back, the police
said. Ms. Taylor, 26, was killed.

Mr. Walker, 27, has contended that he did not know that it was police
officers who had been knocking at the door and feared for his life when
he grabbed his gun and fired.

``We're happy that the case is dismissed,'' said Mr. Walker's lawyer,
Rob Eggert. ``He always said that he didn't know these were police
officers, and they found no drugs in the apartment. None. He was scared
for his life and her life.''

\href{https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/05/12/breonna-taylor-louisville-emt-not-main-target-drug-investigation/3115928001/}{The
Louisville Courier-Journal reported} that the police had been targeting
two men who they believed were selling drugs out of a house more than 10
miles from Ms. Taylor's apartment. However, a judge had signed a warrant
allowing officers to search Ms. Taylor's home --- and to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/03/18/us/forced-entry-warrant-drug-raid.html}{enter
without warning} --- in part because a detective said one of the men had
used Ms. Taylor's apartment to receive a package.

Mr. Wine's decision to drop charges came one day after Mr. Eggert filed
a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that prosecutors failed to present
a full and fair picture to the grand jury. Specifically, Mr. Eggert
contended that they neglected to present Mr. Walker's claim that he was
acting in self-defense.

Mr. Wine said he disagreed with Mr. Eggert's contention that prosecutors
acted unethically but he agreed that more information should have been
presented to the grand jury that indicted Mr. Walker on March 19,
including Mr. Walker's statement to the police in the early morning
hours after the shooting.

Mr. Wine said that it has been his practice in other cases to allow
defendants to present evidence that they were acting in self-defense
during a shooting.

``I've allowed that for police officers in shooting cases,'' Mr. Wine
said, ``and it should be allowed for civilians.''

The prosecutors' request to drop the charges must be approved by a
judge. Mr. Wine said he would not rule out the possibility of filing
charges again after the F.B.I. and other agencies had completed their
reviews of the shooting.

Some legal observers said the decision to drop charges suggested
prosecutors had found potentially serious problems in the police
officers' account of the fatal shooting.

``The decision not to pursue Walker's prosecution at this time, despite
a grand jury indictment, suggests that the officers' credibility and
version of events is in question,'' said Cortney E. Lollar, a law
professor at the University of Kentucky. ``The fact that Wine seems to
be waiting for independent investigators to review the case further
indicates that the prosecutor's office may have a lack of confidence''
in the Louisville Metro Police Department's version of what happened.

Ms. Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, filed a lawsuit in late April
against three officers with the department, accusing them of wrongfully
causing her daughter's death.

One of the lawyers representing Ms. Palmer is Benjamin Crump, who is
among the lawyers representing the family of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia.html}{Ahmaud
Arbery}, whose
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/26/us/ahmed-arbery-shooting-georgia.html}{shooting
death in Georgia} in February has led to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/us/william-bryan-arrest-ahmaud-arbery.html}{murder
charges against three men}.

On Friday, Mr. Crump called prosecutors' decision to drop charges
against Mr. Walker ``a belated victory for justice and a powerful
testament to the power of advocacy.''

``This is just another step to the L.M.P.D. taking full responsibility
for its actions,'' Mr. Crump said in a statement that he released with
two other lawyers, Sam Aguiar and Lonita Baker.

On Thursday, Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville said that Chief Steve
Conrad of the Louisville Metro Police Department would retire at the end
of June.

Mr. Fischer said at a news conference that in response to Ms. Taylor's
shooting, ``no knock'' search warrants, like the one issued in this
case, would require approval from the police chief or someone he
designates before being sent to a judge for approval.

Last week, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky called reports about Ms.
Taylor's death ``troubling'' and said the public deserved to know
everything about the March raid.

He asked the state attorney general, the local prosecutor and the
federal prosecutor assigned to the region to review the results of the
Louisville police's initial investigation ``to ensure justice is done at
a time when many are concerned that justice is not blind.''
