The debate over whether [Americans should wear face masks to control
coronavirus
transmission](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-best-face-masks.html)
has been settled. Governments and businesses now require or at least
recommend them in many public settings. But as parts of the country
reopen, some doctors want you to consider another layer of personal
protective equipment in your daily life: clear plastic [face
shields](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/well/live/face-shields-masks-valves-vents.html).

‚ÄúI wear a face shield every time I enter a store or other building,‚Äù
said Dr. Eli Perencevich. ‚ÄúSometimes I also wear a cloth
[mask](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-face-masks-surveys.html)
if required by the store‚Äôs policy.‚Äù

Dr. Perencevich is an infectious disease physician at the University of
Iowa and the Iowa City Veterans Affairs Health Care System. In an
opinion article published last month in
[JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765525), he
and two colleagues argued that simple, clear plastic face shields could
help reduce the transmission of infections when added to public health
measures like increased testing, contact tracing, social distancing and
hand hygiene.

The idea is not just a thought experiment. In Singapore, preschool
students and their teachers will receive [face
shields](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-face-shield-hand-sanitiser-students-school-reopen-12759972)when
they return to school next month. Local health experts recommended
[teachers in Philadelphia wear

But it can be difficult to imagine Americans being willing to put on
another form of protective equipment. [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/us/politics/100000007124695/trump-coronavirus-mask-factory.html)
and [Vice President Mike
Pence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/us/politics/coronavirus-pence-mask.html)
have shirked wearing masks in settings that would seem to call for them,
and simple [face covering requirements have provoked
conflicts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-masks-violence.html)
at grocery stores and restaurants.

Face shields have long been required equipment for many procedures in
hospitals. Doctors and nurses wear them when intubating Covid-19
patients and during surgeries that may cause blood and bone fragments to
fly out.

As debate arose over whether tiny coronavirus droplets could float on
air currents, protecting the eyes and the entire face became a bigger
issue in health care settings, said Dr. Sherry Yu, a dermatology
resident affiliated with Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital in Boston. People
needed them to do nasal swabs for the coronavirus test or for triage in
the emergency room. As shortages loomed, Dr. Yu was among the [many
people and groups around the country who began fabricating face
shields](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/health/coronavirus-innovators.html)
for front-line health care workers.

‚ÄúThe nice thing about face shields is that they can be resterilized and
cleaned by the user, so they‚Äôre reusable indefinitely until some
component breaks or cracks,‚Äù Dr. Yu said. A simple alcohol wipe or rinse
with soap and hot water is all it takes for the shields to be
contaminant-free again.

Surgical
[masks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/health/coronavirus-cdc-masks-gatherings.html)
and N95s, on the other hand, are meant to be disposed after each use,
although some studies have shown
[masks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/face-shield-mask-california-coronavirus.html)
can be reused [two or three
times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/health/n95-masks-decontaminated-coronavirus.html)
after being sterilized before they lose integrity.

Dr. Perencevich believes that face shields should be the preferred
personal protective equipment of everyone for the same reason health
care workers use them. They protect the entire face, including the eyes,
and prevent people from touching their faces or inadvertently exposing
themselves to the coronavirus.

Face shields may be easier to wear than masks, he said, comparing them
with [wearing glasses or a
hat](https://twitter.com/eliowa/status/1261299983560716288). They wrap
around a small portion of a person‚Äôs forehead rather than covering more
than half their face with material that can create the urge to itch.

Many people also wear masks incorrectly, letting them dangle off the
tips of their noses, or concealing just their mouths. People also tend
to readjust face masks frequently, or remove them to communicate with
others, which increases their risk of being exposed or infecting others,
he said. And while cloth masks can prevent people from spreading germs
to others, they don‚Äôt usually protect the wearer from infection.

Face shields can also aid people who depend on lip-reading, Dr.
Perencevich said. They may be slightly dorky-looking, but the shields
allow facial expressions and lip movements to remain visible, while
serving as an obvious reminder to maintain social distancing.

Still, he and other experts acknowledge that face shields have their
limits.

Just like masks, they must be removed when eating in cafeterias or
restaurants. And studies on how effectively they can reduce a person‚Äôs
viral exposure are scarce.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One [cough simulation study
in 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467190) suggested that a
shield could reduce a user‚Äôs viral exposure by 96 percent when worn
within 18 inches of someone who was coughing. But most people in the
general public are much farther away from others they are interacting
with, said William Lindsley, a bioengineer at the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health who led the study. Large droplets that
may contain virus will fall to the ground quickly, reducing the need for
a face shield worn when standing farther away.

Even in close range, there can be scenarios where face shields are not
as effective as masks like N95s that create a seal around one‚Äôs face.
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre facing sideways, or I‚Äôm behind you, maybe you‚Äôre sitting at
a desk and I‚Äôm standing, there‚Äôs other scenarios you can imagine where
droplets can come around a face shield,‚Äù Dr. Lindsley said.

There is also no research on how well one person‚Äôs face shield protects
other people from viral transmission, the concept called source control
that is a primary benefit of surgical and cloth masks.

One of the main reasons the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[changed their recommendations to suggest everyone wear a face
covering](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/health/us-coronavirus-face-masks.html)
in public was to protect others in case they were among the asymptomatic
or pre-symptomatic group of people infected with the virus.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge fan of face shields,‚Äù said Saskia Popescu, a senior
infection-prevention specialist at George Mason University in Fairfax,
Va. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think we can swap them out for face masks just yet.‚Äù

Dr. Perencevich and his colleagues expect that more research will show
shields to be superior to cloth masks, not only because shields provide
full face protection but as they are nearly impossible to wear
incorrectly.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

‚ÄúRemember, effectiveness depends not only on the inherent properties of
the facial covering but also how well the facial covering is worn,‚Äù he
said.

And he and his co-authors like to imagine that people who are reluctant
to wear masks will find face shields more comfortable: Once a person
tries one on, they say, the wearer realizes its many benefits.
