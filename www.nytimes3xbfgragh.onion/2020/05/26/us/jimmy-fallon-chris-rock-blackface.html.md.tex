In a `Saturday Night Live' sketch from 2000, Mr. Fallon appears in
blackface while impersonating his fellow comedian Chris Rock.

Jimmy Fallon, the host of ``The Tonight Show,'' apologized on Tuesday
for wearing
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/arts/television/30-rock-blackface-Tina-fey.html}{blackface}
while impersonating fellow comedian Chris Rock on ``Saturday Night
Live'' two decades ago.

``In 2000, while on SNL, I made a terrible decision to do an
impersonation of Chris Rock while in blackface,'' Mr. Fallon said
\href{https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/1265386757958389768}{on
Twitter}. ``There is no excuse for this. I am very sorry for making this
unquestionably offensive decision and thank all of you for holding me
accountable.''

In \href{https://youtu.be/V2iFSuyLoIs?t=463}{a video of the sketch} that
recently resurfaced on social media, Mr. Fallon appears opposite Darrell
Hammond, who was impersonating the television host Regis Philbin.

Mr. Fallon wears a black turtleneck, a black leather jacket and a wig.
His face is covered in dark makeup. He appears in the sketch for less
than a minute.

``I've seen `Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,' and guess what? Not a lot
of black folks on the show,'' Mr. Fallon says in the skit, setting up
his punchline.

``Know why? Because black folks don't like to answer questions,'' he
continues. ``Oh, they want to be millionaires, but you got to ask their
kind of question, like, `In 1981, how many grams of crack did Rick James
smoke when he recorded ``Super Freak''?'''

Mr. Fallon declined to comment further on the sketch. Mr. Rock did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Fallon is not the only late-night talk show host with a blackface
performance in his past.

video} of Jimmy Kimmel, the host of ABC's ``Jimmy Kimmel Live,'' wearing
blackface while impersonating the N.B.A. player Karl Malone on ``The Man
Show'' resurfaced last year. The skit was part of a segment where Mr.
Kimmel repeatedly wore blackface to impersonate Mr. Malone. Mr. Kimmel
has not recently addressed the video.
