Simmons generated controversy at Sundance when Oprah Winfrey pulled out

In her 1999 book, “When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: A Hip-Hop
Feminist Breaks It Down,” the cultural critic [Joan
Morgan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/15/books/review-she-begat-this-lauryn-hill-joan-morgan.html)
describes eloquently the ways in which racism often makes it difficult
for black women to call out sexism within their own communities. “I
needed a feminism that would allow us to continue loving ourselves and
the brothers who hurt us without letting race loyalty buy us early
tombstones,” she wrote.

She reiterates that sentiment in “On the Record,” a wrenching new
documentary by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, [streaming on HBO
Max](https://www.hbomax.com/feature/urn:hbo:feature:GXrw_sA07SZGXWQEAAADb).
The film details the allegations of sexual assault against the music
mogul Russell Simmons, but its scope is much wider: It explores the
particular (and often overlooked) struggles of black women in the
\#MeToo movement. At its center is Drew Dixon, 48, who says Simmons
raped her in 1995 while she was a rising A\&R executive at his
pioneering company, Def Jam Records. Dixon didn’t speak publicly about
the incident for more than two decades, fearing that challenging the
“godfather of hip-hop” would amount to a betrayal of her community. “I
didn’t want to let the culture down,” she says poignantly. “I love the
culture. I loved Russell, too.”

“On the Record” closely follows Dixon before, during and after her
decision to go public with her accusations in a [December 2017
article](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/13/arts/music/russell-simmons-rape.html)
in The New York Times. It also weaves in the testimonies of seven other
women who say they were raped by Simmons — including the writer [Jenny
Lume](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/writer-jenny-lumet-russell-simmons-sexually-violated-me-guest-column-1062934)t,
the former assistant and model [Sil Lai
Abrams](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/21/nbc-russell-simmons-aj-calloway-accuser-sil-lai-abrams/4051745002/)
and the hip-hop artist [Sherri
Hines](https://www.wnyc.org/story/woman-speaks-out-against-russell-simmons-alleged-rape/).
(Simmons has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex and described
his life as “devoid of violence” in a written response to the
filmmakers.)

The stories of these women hit the familiar beats of the countless
\#MeToo narratives that have emerged since the reckoning of Harvey
Weinstein three years ago: abuses of power, derailed careers, fearful
silences, doubts and dismissals. But for black women who have been
assaulted by black men, the quest for justice is intersectional. It
involves negotiations between solidarity and salvation.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The film communicates these complex ideas with quiet, forceful emotional
clarity. It’s the latest in Dick and Ziering’s formidable oeuvre of
documentaries on the subject: Their previous collaborations, like “[The
Invisible
War](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/06/22/movies/the-invisible-war-directed-by-kirby-dick.html),”
about sexual assault in the military, and “[The Hunting
Ground](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/02/27/movies/review-the-hunting-ground-documentary-a-searing-look-at-campus-rape.html),”
about rape on college campuses, provoked strong, polarized reactions and
substantive policy changes. “On the Record” is a relatively modest film
— more character study than exposé — but it has already attracted
considerable controversy. Shortly before it premiered at the Sundance
Film Festival in January, [Oprah
Winfrey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/11/business/media/oprah-winfrey-documentary-russell-simmons-apple.html),
one of its executive producers, dropped out, citing creative
differences, and the filmmakers lost their distribution deal with Apple
TV and moved to HBO Max.

Amid speculation that Simmons might have pressured Winfrey to withdraw,
[she told The
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/17/movies/oprah-winfrey-russell-simmons-movie.html)
that she continued to stand by the women in the film but felt that their
stories hadn’t been sufficiently “elevated,” and that the film lacked an
appropriately broad context that took in the “debauchery” of the music
business at the time. Winfrey’s concerns about the narrow focus and
selective context don’t seem misplaced, but these strike me as strengths
rather than shortcomings. “On the Record” is not a work of journalism.
Most of the accusations have been reported on extensively in the last
two years in [various
publications](https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-russell-simmons-yoga-20171213-htmlstory.html).
What the film does is bring these accounts to living, breathing and
*moving* life, taking us beyond the media cycles of allegation and
denial to a survivor’s intimate confrontations with cultural pressures
and trauma.

Dixon makes for a stirring and charismatic protagonist, her face
lighting up with joy as she describes walking the streets of Brooklyn
with Biggie Smalls and putting together a Grammy-winning record with
Method Man and Mary J. Blige. When the harassment began, she thought her
talent would protect her from danger. “I am an executive with value, and
he’s a businessperson,” she says. When she’s proved wrong, it’s a
crushing lesson: Misogyny razes all ideas of value and worth, even in
seemingly meritocratic settings.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A few years later, while working a different job at Arista Records,
Dixon is confronted by this reality all over again. When she rebuffed
the advances of L.A. Reid, then the chief executive, she says he
punished her by passing on two up-and-coming artists she had scouted:
Kanye West and John Legend. (Reid has said [he apologized if anything he
had said or done had been
“misinterpreted.”](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michaelblackmon/drew-dixon-profile-russell-simmons-me-too-rape))

Employing a plain, by-the-numbers style, Dick and Ziering make a
deliberate choice to let their interviewees take center stage,
contextualizing their stories with some archival images. These inserts
can feel glib. One hasty sequence, which seems to support some of
Winfrey’s reservations, starts with excerpts from rap videos to
demonstrate the prevalence of sexism in hip-hop, then follows up with
clips from songs by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to clarify,
rather awkwardly, that sexism isn’t confined to hip-hop.

But these nominal bits of editorialization are supplemented by a superb
cast of cultural commentators, who represent the real, intellectual
force of “On the Record.” In addition to Morgan, they include Tarana
Burke, the founder of the \#MeToo movement, Kimberlé Crenshaw, the
scholar behind the theory of
[intersectionality](https://time.com/5786710/kimberle-crenshaw-intersectionality/),
and Kierna Mayo, the former editor of Ebony magazine.

As Dixon and the other survivors describe their painful experiences of
harassment and shame, the commentators situate them eloquently within
the broader picture of African-American history and raise important
questions that have often remained at the periphery of the \#MeToo
movement. They explain, for instance, how black women’s fear of speaking
out against their abusers is rooted in the legacy of false rape
accusations against black men — and that the criminal justice system
offers little hope to communities that have long suffered its biases.

The filmmakers do an admirable job of switching between these micro and
macro perspectives in a tight and accessible 95 minutes. Their movie
makes a sincere case for Dixon’s quiet plea to the camera: “It’s time
for somebody to acknowledge the burden and the plunder of black women.”
