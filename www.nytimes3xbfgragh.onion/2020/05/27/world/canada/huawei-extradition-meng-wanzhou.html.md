# Extradition of Huawei Executive Clears a Major Legal Hurdle in Canada

</div>

A Vancouver court ruled that fraud charges against Meng Wanzhou in the
United States would constitute a crime in Canada, opening the way for
her extradition.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

VANCOUVER, British Columbia — The chief financial officer of the Chinese
technology giant Huawei came one step closer to standing trial in the
United States on sweeping fraud charges after a Canadian court ruled on
Wednesday that prosecutors had satisfied a critical legal requirement
for her extradition from Canada.

The executive, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Vancouver in December 2018,
at the request of the United States, and [indicted in
January 2019.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/28/us/politics/meng-wanzhou-huawei-iran.html)
Her detention set off one of the biggest legal dramas in recent Canadian
memory, its twists and turns parsed on national television.

Her arrest also thrust Canada into the middle of a diplomatic struggle
between the United States and China — over trade, theft of technology
secrets and whether Huawei’s efforts in helping countries build 5G
next-generation mobile networks present a threat to national security.

And it severely strained Canada’s own relations with China. Shortly
after Ms. Meng’s arrest, China detained — in retaliation, some say — two
Canadians and [accused them of
espionage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/04/world/asia/china-canada-michael-kovrig-huawei.html?module=inline).
They are still in secret jails in China.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That relationship has become more fraught since, with Canadians
criticizing China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its human
rights policies. Wednesday’s decision is expected to aggravate those
tensions.

Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said the
ruling likely presaged “both sides hardening their stances at a moment
when countries are already questioning China’s role in the pandemic.”

On Wednesday, Huawei said that it was “disappointed” in the ruling, and
that it expected Ms. Meng would ultimately be proved innocent.

Chinese state media this week signaled there could be a backlash if the
ruling did not go in Ms. Meng’s favor. [Global
Times](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1189476.shtml), a state-owned
tabloid with a nationalist bent, warned of “resentment” in China should
the judge make a decision that “panders to the Trump administration.”

After the decision, Canada’s minister of foreign affairs,
[François-Philippe
Champagne](https://twitter.com/FP_Champagne/status/1265725645474213889),
stressed that the Canadian judiciary was independent.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said that Canada would continue to engage with China, and that its
top priority was the release of the two Canadians — the former diplomat
Michael Kovrig and the businessman Michael Spavor — “who have been
arbitrarily detained for over 500 days.”

Ms. Meng will have another chance to fight for her release in the coming
months at hearings on whether her rights were violated during her
arrest.

While the Meng case has complicated Canadian diplomacy, Wednesday’s
decision was a matter of law.

In her decision, Heather Holmes, associate chief justice of the British
Columbia Supreme Court, found that prosecutors had cleared a fundamental
hurdle for Ms. Meng’s extradition under Canadian law — demonstrating
that the conduct she is accused of in the United States, if proved, also
constitutes a crime in Canada.

The legal concept is known as “double criminality.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The judge ruled that double criminality was met because the conduct Ms.
Meng is accused of — “the making of intentionally false statements” —
meets the essence of fraud.

In their indictment against Ms. Meng, now 48, United States prosecutors
charged Ms. Meng with fraudulently deceiving four banks into making
transactions to help Huawei evade United States sanctions against Iran.

Her defense team argued that the extradition request did not satisfy the
requirement of double criminality because it was based on the accusation
that U.S. sanctions against Iran had been breached — sanctions that
Canada no longer has in place.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Prosecutors said Ms. Meng lied to representatives of the bank HSBC in
2013 about Huawei’s relationship with Skycom, a company that would clear
transactions between Huawei and HSBC in Iran, by saying Skycom was a
partner, rather than a subsidiary, of Huawei.

They said that misrepresentation amounted to fraud by exposing HSBC to
reputational and economic risk in light of the American sanctions.

“Lying to a bank in order to get banking services that creates a risk of
economic prejudice is fraud,” said Robert Frater, Canada’s chief general
counsel for the Department of Justice, [arguing the United States’
case](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/20/world/canada/meng-wanzhou-huawei-detention-vancouver.html)
in court earlier this year.

Ms. Meng, the eldest daughter of Huawei’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, one of
China’s most prominent businessmen, has denied the
allegations.

The U.S. indictment charging Ms. Meng also accused Huawei of stealing

The United States argues that Huawei’s ties to the Chinese government
make it a threat to the national security of countries who adopt its
technology in their next generation mobile networks. Huawei vehemently
denies that.

The Trump administration escalated its campaign against Huawei this

Despite the assertion by Mr. Champagne, the foreign minister, that
Canada would continue to engage with China, experts said that China’s
behavior was spurring Canadians to rethink how to deal with the economic
superpower.

In addition to detaining the two Canadians, China also restricted
imports of pork, canola oil and other Canadian products after Ms. Meng’s
arrest.

David Mulroney, another former Canadian ambassador to China, said
China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, its infringements of
human rights [in Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-china-hong-kong.html)
and its[mass detention of
minorities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html)in
Xinjiang had also worsened relations with Beijing.

“There has been a global awakening prompted by the pandemic that China
is an unreliable partner,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said China had linked the
detention of the two Canadians with Ms. Meng’s case from the beginning,
and had failed to understand that Canada had an independent judicial
system.

Ms. Meng’s defense has filed a separate civil case against Canadian
authorities, arguing that her rights were breached when border officials
questioned her for three hours before making an arrest, seized her
phones, asked for her passcodes and searched her eight pieces of
luggage.

Government prosecutors counter that the border guards had every right to
search her.

In early 2019, Ms. Meng was released [on
bail](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/04/world/canada/huawei-canada-meng-wanzhou.html?module=inline)
of 10 million Canadian dollars. She has spent the time since living in
two different mansions that her family owns in wealthy areas of
Vancouver.

Most recently, she has lived in a gated $14 million, seven-bedroom
mansion in the city’s exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. Until the
pandemic hit, she was able to travel relatively freely around the city —
shopping and attending musical concerts — though she had to wear a GPS
tracker on her ankle.

She takes daily painting lessons and her mother has been living with
her.

Last weekend, she appeared at the steps of the imposing modernist
British Columbia Supreme Court, making a [thumbs-up
gesture](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-photographs-posing-court-1.5582689)

Many in Canada have noted the contrast between her circumstances and
those of the Canadians imprisoned in China, whose access to lawyers and
their families is severely
limited.

Ms. Meng could appeal a final decision on extradition to the Supreme
Court of Canada, a process that experts say could drag on for years.

After a ruling from the Supreme Court, the case would move to the
political arena, with the justice minister of Canada making the final
decision on whether she must be sent to the United States to stand
trial.
