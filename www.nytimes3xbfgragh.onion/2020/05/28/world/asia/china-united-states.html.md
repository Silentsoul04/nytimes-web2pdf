# Beijing Hardens Resolve to Defy U.S., Even While Calling for Cooperation

</div>

From China’s perspective, the punitive American measures on trade,
technology and Hong Kong have revealed a core American hostility. But
China does not want to incinerate the relationship.

BEIJING —<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Ignoring threats from
Washington, China stripped another layer of autonomy from [Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/01/world/asia/Hong-kong-Tiananmen-vigil-banned.html)
on Thursday, plowing ahead with a plan that would ban any form of
dissent deemed subversive in the territory reclaimed from Britain more
than two decades ago.

But even as the plan was approved by China’s top legislative body, and
Chinese officials taunted the United States as an imperious meddler,
Premier Li Keqiang struck a conciliatory tone. While offering no
concessions to American demands, he called for close trade relations
between the two countries.

The clash over [Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/01/world/asia/Hong-kong-Tiananmen-vigil-banned.html)
and other issues points to the quandary facing China as it grows in
power and contends with an increasingly aggressive Trump administration.
The Chinese leadership does not want to incinerate the relationship with
the United States, given the enormous economic benefits. Nor is it
willing to back down, reflecting divisions in Beijing between hawks and
more moderating forces.

“Anything the U.S. says or does or will do, China will refuse,” Shi
Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in
Beijing, said in a telephone interview.

With both countries blaming each other for the coronavirus pandemic,
trade disputes and now the crisis roiling Hong Kong, the result has been
a downward spiral of actions and responses that may not let up before
Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign ends in November.

The back-and-forth between Washington and Beijing intensified in the
past two days.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared on Wednesday that Washington
would no longer consider [Hong Kong to have significant
autonomy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/14/business/hong-kong-protests-recession.html),
clearing the way for Mr. Trump to end the [special trade and economic
relations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/world/asia/trump-pompeo-china-hong-kong.html)
the territory now enjoys.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Less
than 24 hours later,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the
National People’s Congress, China’s legislature, did precisely what Mr.
Pompeo had railed against: authorizing new security laws in Hong Kong.

After the United States won [an initial
victory](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/world/canada/huawei-extradition-meng-wanzhou.html)
in a Canadian court on Wednesday in its long effort to bring criminal
charges against a senior executive of Huawei, the Chinese
telecommunications giant, China swiftly vowed to retaliate against both
Canada and the United States. China already had blocked some Canadian
exports and detained two Canadian citizens for more than 500 days.

Trump administration officials argue that they have brought China to the
table on trade by imposing tariffs. But they have failed so far to
achieve their goal of fundamentally shifting China’s behavior — on trade
or any other issue.

From Beijing’s perspective, the punitive measures have simply revealed
the core of American hostility toward China.

“When China was rising as an economic power, the United States tolerated
it,” Shen Dingli, an expert on relations with the United States at Fudan
University in Shanghai, said in a telephone interview. “Now that China
is strong, it cannot tolerate it anymore.”

When the Trump administration announced new restrictions to block
companies around the world from using American-made machinery and
software to help Huawei, Beijing promised to target American technology
companies operating in China.

When the administration capped the number of Chinese journalists in the
United States, [China kicked
out](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/business/media/china-expels-american-journalists.html)
most of the American correspondents from three major news organizations
in the United States, including The New York Times.

Both Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China feel compelled to
appear strong. The American president views blaming China for the
coronavirus crisis in the United States as a path to re-election. The
Chinese leader faces enormous economic and diplomatic challenges that
could stir domestic opposition to his grip on power.

What the American moves have not done is chasten Mr. Xi’s government,
which appears to feel simultaneously embattled and defiant.

Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor of Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid
controlled by the Communist Party, all but dared the Trump
administration to carry out its threat to end Hong Kong’s favored trade
status. He noted that there were 85,000 Americans there and scores of
companies that would reap “the bitter fruits” of the American decision.

“Washington is too narcissistic,” he
[wrote](https://m.weibo.cn/status/4509393636362290?display=0&retcode=6102)
in Chinese on Weibo on Thursday. “American politicians like Pompeo
arrogantly think that the fate of Hong Kong is in their hands.”

The National People’s Congress on Thursday dutifully adopted the
government’s proposals to impose new laws on Hong Kong to suppress
subversion, secession, terrorism and other acts that might threaten
China’s national security — as the authorities in Beijing define it. The
vote was nearly unanimous, with only one delegate voting against and six
abstaining.

China’s authoritarian system and state-run media give Mr. Xi enormous
power to control the message in the face of American hostility —
exploiting it to rally popular outrage and tempering it to play the role
of magnanimous global partner.

At his ritual news conference wrapping up the National People’s Congress
on Thursday, Mr. Li, the premier, singled out for praise an American
company, Honeywell, that on Tuesday announced an investment in Wuhan —
the city from which the pandemic spread. A month before, the Pentagon
had awarded Honeywell a contract to supply protective masks.

Mr. Li twice called for “peaceful” relations with Taiwan, after
conspicuously dropping the word when he discussed Taiwan at the start of
the weeklong legislative session. And he underlined China’s willingness
to look further for the origins of the coronavirus.

China, though, has shown little inclination for compromise.

Beijing reacted harshly to a Canadian court’s ruling that cleared an
initial hurdle for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive
of Huawei charged by the United States with bank fraud related to
American sanctions against Iran.

“The purpose of the United States is to bring down Huawei and other
Chinese high-tech companies, and Canada has been acting in the process
as an accomplice of the United States,” the embassy [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChinaEmbOttawa/status/1265762374004494338),
which is banned inside China. “The whole case is entirely a grave
political incident.”

China has already retaliated against Canadian exports of pork, canola
oil and other products, and in recent days it has hinted that it will
target still more. It has also held two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and
Michael Spavor, in secret detention on state security charges widely
viewed as retaliatory.

Neither has appeared in a public court hearing or been afforded access
to lawyers during court proceedings. That has hardened anti-Chinese
sentiment in Canada, which had not historically been as suspicious of
Beijing as, say, the United States has.

The International Crisis Group, where Mr. Kovrig, a former diplomat,
worked, posted a message on Twitter noting that Thursday was his 535th
day in detention. “Each passing day is a stain on China’s reputation,”
the group said.

Mr. Xi, who has ruled with an increasingly authoritarian grip since
2012, seems
[impervious](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/24/world/asia/china-hong-kong-taiwan.html)

seizing on nationalist themes to deflect from the government’s early

also showed it will not be distracted from its defense of territorial
claims along its land and sea borders — from the South China Sea to the
Himalayas.

The commander of the People’s Liberation Army’s garrison in Hong Kong

The bravado has weakened what leverage the United States might once have
wielded: the threat of international condemnation, restrictions on
trade, even the prospect of decoupling the world’s two largest
economies. Beijing now seems willing to bear any cost.

Lau Siu-kai, a former senior Hong Kong government official who advises
Beijing, said that American pressure had failed to prompt a
reconsideration in the Hong Kong issue, in part because China’s
leadership has anticipated American opposition on many fronts.

“Beijing will stick with its new policy toward Hong Kong regardless of
U.S. reactions and is prepared to take countermeasures in a tit-for-tat
manner,” he said.

Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing, and Steven Lee Myers from Seoul,
South Korea. Research was contributed by Claire Fu, Wang Yiwei, Amber
Wang and Liu Yi from Beijing.
