# Twitter Places Warning on Congressman’s Tweet for Glorifying Violence

The post, from Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, had
likened protesters to terrorists and called for them to be hunted
down.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Days after [restricting one of President Trump’s
posts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/technology/trump-twitter-minneapolis-george-floyd.html)
from view for glorifying violence, Twitter went at it again.

On Monday, the social media service used the same label to hide a
message by Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida — which
likened those who were protesting police violence to terrorists and
called for them to be hunted down. The move also meant that the tweet
could not be retweeted or liked, to prevent it from being amplified.

“Now that we clearly see Antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down
like we do those in the Middle East?” Mr. Gaetz had tweeted on Monday,
referring to the [far-left anti-fascist activist
movement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-antifa-trump.html).
Shortly after his tweet was hidden, he [reposted a message from the
president](https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1267605537790853133)
that called for a law that gives technology companies some legal
immunities to be revoked. “Their warning is my badge of honor,” [he
wrote later on
Monday](https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1267615035767107586).

Twitter last week engaged in a face-off with the president after adding
fact-check labels to two of his tweets and then restricting a post in
which Mr. Trump said that looting during the protests would lead to
shooting. While the San Francisco company was applauded by some for
taking more responsibility for the kinds of posts that appear on its
platform, others said it was biased against conservatives like Mr.
Trump.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, Twitter acted again, hiding Mr. Gaetz’s post behind a warning
label — though it stopped short of taking down his message altogether.

“The Tweet is in violation of our glorification of violence policy,” a
Twitter spokesman said.

Twitter last year announced a labeling system that marks tweets from
public figures that violate its policies while allowing the messages to
remain because they are the subject of significant public interest.

But it did not use the system to flag any messages from U.S. politicians
until Friday, when Mr. Trump weighed in on the clashes between the
police and protesters in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd,
an African-American man who died in police custody. Mr. Trump tweeted,
“[when the looting starts, the shooting
starts.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/looting-starts-shooting-starts.html)”

After Twitter added the label to the message that it had violated its
policy about glorifying violence, the official Twitter account for the
White House republished Mr. Trump’s tweet. Twitter hid that tweet as
well. The phrase was used in the 1960s by a Miami police chief widely
condemned by civil rights groups.

Earlier last week, the company had invoked a separate policy against
election interference to place a fact-check label on two tweets from Mr.
Trump in which he falsely asserted that mail-in ballots for the November
election were being illegally distributed and would lead to widespread
election fraud.

In response to Twitter’s actions, Mr. Trump last Thursday [signed an
executive
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-order-social-media.html)
that was meant to chip away at liability protections that social media
companies have for the content that is posted on their sites. The
executive order specifically targets a statute known as [Section 230 of
the Communications Decency
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/business/section-230-internet-speech.html).

Technology companies have argued that the law is essential to their
operations. But some lawmakers have said that the companies enjoy
unchecked power and have proposed modifications to the law. Mr. Trump’s
order is likely to face significant legal challenges, experts have said.

Twitter has drawn criticism for acting inconsistently with the labels.
On Monday, Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, also posted
on Twitter calling for a military crackdown on protests, adding, “No
quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.”

Some people argued that the tweet also glorified violence and called on
Twitter to remove it, but the company said Mr. Cotton’s post did not
violate its rules.

“It’s never possible to be completely consistent with any policy about
speech. You have to draw lines somewhere and the lines are always going
to be a little bit arbitrary,” said James Grimmelmann, a law professor
at Cornell University. “There is no apolitical position.”

Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.
