In February, news from the [Wynn Las
Vegas](https://www.wynnlasvegas.com/) included plans for Valentine’s Day
(among the offerings: a “Lover’s Menu for Two”) and National Margarita
Day (four new cocktails).

What a difference a pandemic makes.

Three months later, the casino resort
[announced](https://www.visitwynn.com/documents/Wynn-Health-Plan.pdf) a
much more sober initiative, the “Wynn Las Vegas Health & Disinfection
Program.” The 28-page
[memo](https://www.visitwynn.com/documents/Wynn-Health-Plan.pdf) lays
out how the 2,700-room property will address health and hygiene when it
reopens. Out with mezcal and barhopping; in with thermal cameras,
elevator capacity limits and disinfection protocols for the Chipper
Champ, a chip-sorting machine.

According to the [American Hotel & Lodging
Association,](https://www.ahla.com/covid-19s-impact-hotel-industry) an
industry group, the coronavirus outbreak has cost hotels in the United
States more than $23 billion in room revenue since mid-February. As
these properties prepare for a new operational reality — one that must
balance federal, state and local laws and consumer anxiety about getting
sick — the world’s largest hotel companies have all come forward in
recent weeks to announce new cleaning playbooks.

“The first question that comes to mind when someone’s making the
decision to book is: ‘Am I going to be safe?’” said [Suzanne Markham
Bagnera](https://www.bu.edu/hospitality/profile/suzanne-markham-bagnera/),
Ph.D., assistant clinical professor and chair of the undergraduate
program in the School of Hospitality Administration at Boston
University. “Cleaning has traditionally been a back-of-the-house or
behind-the-scenes tactic, hotels are now needing to bring that to the
center stage.”

Hyatt, a [Global Care & Cleanliness
Commitment](https://www.hyatt.com/info/global-care-and-cleanliness-commitment).
Topping it off is the American Hotel & Lodging Association’s [Safe
Stay,](https://www.ahla.com/safestay) a list of general industry
recommendations.

“It’s not about what these names say outright — it’s about what they
signify,” said [Anthony Shore,](https://www.operativewords.com/) a
linguist who helps name products and companies. “We used to take a clean
hotel room for granted and hope that hotels would deliver. But now,
because we associate the word ‘clean’ with something that is virus-free,
it has become more loaded than it used to be.”

Although there are no hotel-specific disinfection guidelines from the
Centers for Disease Control, the agency’s general Covid-19 resources —
including [everyday steps for
employers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html)
and [best reopening practices for
businesses](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-guidance.html)
— has offered a foundation for hotels as they’ve sought to create their
own. Many of the new cleaning plans include a consultancy with a leading
medical organization, products and technologies from Ecolab (a major
hygiene and safety company), some element of social distancing,
increased disinfection of guest rooms and public spaces, and a
commitment to procure and test new technologies like robots and
ultraviolet light.

Guests will immediately notice the disappearance of the breakfast
buffet, the decluttering of nonessential room items like throw pillows,
and the wearing of masks and other personal protective equipment by
staff.

## More cleaning, more jobs?

Mr. Shore said the new batch of nomenclature from hotel marketing teams

departure from the pre-Covid era. But these measures, if implemented
fully, will substantially alter how hotels operate.

“This is completely going to change the role and realm of housekeeping,”
Dr. Bagnera said. “With occupancy rates so low, now is the perfect
opportunity for hotel general managers to work with their teams and make
sure they’re mapping out how they’re going to clean the rooms, how
they’re going to be efficient and how they’re going to keep their
employees
safe.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For [Unite Here](https://unitehere.org/), a hospitality workers’ union
with 300,000 members in North America, the new guidelines raise
questions about what will happen when hotel workers clock back in. More
than 95 percent of its union members are not working as a result of the
pandemic.

“These new measures — and the reality that they must be adhered to well
into the future — point to a need for more workers across the board,”
said D. Taylor, Unite Here’s international president.

Best Western predicts that its “We Care Clean” program — which includes
more disinfection of touchpoints like faucets and door handles — will
increase the time it takes to clean each room by 50
percent.Industrywide, the use of new disinfectants — which must sit on a
surface for a certain amount of time in order to be effective — will
force an adjustment to the flow in which rooms are serviced.

## Playbooks, not strict rules

Whereas Wynn’s lengthy memo gets into the weeds about what will happen
at one stand-alone casino-resort — “Addition of inserts into golf hole
cups to allow easy removal of balls” — companies with thousands of
hotels can’t offer that level of detail. Rather, their new cleaning
guidelines are meant as overarching navigational tools. They’re
guidelines and best practices, not strict directives.

“CleanStay” will begin rolling out to all Hilton brands worldwide in
June. Marriott is taking a phased approach to its rollout over the next
30 to 90 days, and to all 30 brands, including The Ritz-Carlton.

But most big chains do not usually own, and often don’t operate, the
hotels bearing their names, meaning it’s up to individual franchise
owners to fund supplies, training and
marketing.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a

        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made

        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

That makes oversight a challenge. Best Western will have a system of
self-auditing for its 2,200 North American hotels; general managers will
be asked to keep a “We Care Clean” checklist on file. Wyndham will
kick-start “Count on Us” by financing and shipping the first round of
masks, hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes to more than 6,000 hotels
and allow them to defer repayment until September. All of Hyatt’s
managed and franchised hotels — more than 900 globally — will appoint
“Hygiene Managers.”

## Hygiene gets personal

Boutique hotels could face additional hurdles as they seek to marry
cleanliness with individual expression.

[Quirk Hotel,
Charlottesville,](https://www.destinationhotels.com/hotels-and-resorts/quirk-hotel-charlottesville)
in Virginia, opened in early March only to temporarily close less than
two weeks later. As it preps for a June reopening, its leadership is
considering ways to adhere to Hyatt’s global guidelines (Quirk is part
of Destination Hotels, a Hyatt brand) without losing the identity
suggested by the hotel’s name. Employees will wear light-pink masks — a
nod to the hotel’s logo and lobby décor — custom tailored by a local
garment maker; no-touch restaurant menus will double as clever, artistic
table centerpieces.

“We are doing everything possible to go beyond simply complying with the
new requirements from our parent brand, Hyatt, and the governing state
of Virginia to ensure the heart and soul of our property stays intact,”
said Matthew Brink, the hotel’s general manager.

Personal touches go even further at fully independent hotels. At [Old
Edwards Inn &
Spa](https://www.oldedwardshospitality.com/old-edwards-inn-spa) and
[Half-Mile Farm,](https://www.oldedwardshospitality.com/half-mile-farm)
sister luxury hotels in Highlands, N.C., staff members are undergoing
eye-expression training to decipher the needs and emotions of guests
wearing face masks. The [Inn at Little
Washington,](https://theinnatlittlewashington.com/) in Virginia, is
using life-size mannequins to fill out the state-mandated socially
distanced seating at its Michelin-starred restaurant. [Ocean
House](https://www.oceanhouseri.com/), on the Rhode Island coast, is
supplanting its nightly happy hour at the bar with a canape-and-cocktail
cart that pushes from room to
room.

## The New Responsibilities of Guests

These visual cues will be paramount as hotels big and small rebuild
consumer confidence.
[Data](https://www.mmgyintel.com/travel-intentions-pulse-survey-tips-impact-covid-19)
from the U.S. Travel Association and MMGY Travel Intelligence suggests
that Americans right now consider [vacation rentals safer than
hotels](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/travel/hotels-versus-airbnb-pandemic.html).
In a recent survey of nearly 4,600 respondents, the management
consulting firm [Oliver Wyman](http://oliverwyman.com/) found that
improved health and cleaning is the chief factor impacting the decision
to stay at a hotel. That’s why most of the new guidelines encourage
public-facing elements like social-distancing signage, seals identifying
that a room has been disinfected, Plexiglas partitions and more.

“Guests will be interested to know how their room is cleaned, how often
it’s cleaned and who is responsible for maintaining a safe environment
within the hotel,” said Tim Chatfield, the founder and chief executive
of [Jitjatjo,](https://www.jitjatjo.com/) an online hospitality industry
platform.

But in order for any of these new programs to work, industry experts and
hospitality worker activists believe that health and hygiene must become
give-and-take.

“Hotels are asking guests to wear masks, distance themselves, wash their
hands and use sanitizer or wipes before going into the elevator,” Dr.
Bagnera said. “It’s like: ‘Come in and we’ll take care of you at a
hundred percent — but you’ve got to participate in the new process as
well.’”
