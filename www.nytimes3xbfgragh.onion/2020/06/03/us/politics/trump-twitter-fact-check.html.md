# Hey @jack, Here Are More Questionable Tweets From @realdonaldtrump

</div>

We analyzed the president’s Twitter feed for a week. A third of his
posts contained falsehoods or murky accusations, underscoring the
challenge to Twitter’s chief, Jack Dorsey, of policing him.

[Twitter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/us/politics/trump-twitter.html)
and its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, placed warnings on three of
[President
Trump’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/us/politics/trump-twitter.html)
tweets last week, taking a measured but hotly debated step to place some
limit on the president’s use of social media to spread falsehoods and
incite his followers.

Twitter attached labels refuting two of Mr. Trump’s tweets on [voter
fraud](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html)
and [restricted
one](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/technology/trump-twitter-minneapolis-george-floyd.html)that
implied protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. But it left countless
others unchallenged, including those
[baselessly](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/us/politics/klausutis-letter-jack-dorsey.html)
insinuating that the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough killed a former staff
member.

A New York Times review of the president’s 139 Twitter posts from
Sunday, May 24, to Saturday, May 30, found at least 26 contained clearly
false claims, including five about mail-in voting that were not flagged,
five promoting the false conspiracy theory about Mr. Scarborough and
three about Twitter itself. Another 24 were misleading, lacked context
or traded in innuendo. (This analysis did not include dozens of Mr.
Trump’s retweets.)

To put it another way, more than a third of the president’s tweets over
the course of a week contained dubious information. That presents a
challenge both to Twitter and to the millions of people who are exposed
to Mr. Trump on social media, especially now, with the nation facing the
triple challenge of a pandemic, economic dislocation and nationwide
protests over systemic racism.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Unsubstantiated charges of fraud in mail-in voting

Twitter[attached
information](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html)
to refute two of Mr. Trump’s posts about mail-in voting that falsely
claimed that California was sending ballots to “anyone living in the
state no matter who they are or how they got there.” State officials
will mail ballots to registered voters only.

Mr. Dorsey [said](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1265837143827468289)
that those tweets on May 26 specifically violated the company’s civic
integrity policy as they “may mislead people into thinking they don’t
need to register to get a ballot.”

Five other posts by Mr. Trump repeated his general falsehoods about
mail-in voting but did not specify any one state’s election process or
ballot distribution plans — and were not affixed with a label.

Two days before Twitter labeled the two tweets on May 26, the president
[warned](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1264717545787006976)
[twice](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1264558926021959680)
that the upcoming presidential election will be “rigged” through mail-in
ballots. After Twitter’s actions, Mr. Trump continued to claim that
mail-in voting would lead to a “[free for all on cheating, forgery and
the theft of
Ballots](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601615261827072),”
a [”tainted” election
process](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266047584038256640),
“[MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE” and “THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN
PARTY.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266172570983940101)”

There is [no
evidence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/politics/trump-mail-in-voting-absentee-ballots.html)
for any of these claims. Voter fraud in general is extremely rare. While
mail-in voting is less secure than in-person voting, fraud incidence
rates remain extremely low — one study found an improper voting rate of
0.004 percent. Studies have found little evidence that mail-in voting
and so-called no-excuse absentee voting benefit one political party over
another.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Inaccurate claims about Twitter

Mr. Trump responded to Twitter’s actions [by issuing an executive
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html)
that seeks to strip liability protection in certain cases for companies
like
[Twitter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/technology/trump-twitter.html),
Google and Facebook for the content on their sites. If carried out, the
order could lead to the companies facing legal liability for false and
defamatory statements posted on their sites.

The president also took to Twitter to castigate the platform in three
false posts.

He accused the company of “[completely stifling FREE
SPEECH](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265427539008380928).”
But this is a misreading of the First Amendment, which prohibits
Congress from “[abridging the freedom of
speech](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-i).”
While the Supreme Court has held that this applies to all government
agencies, it does [not
apply](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/amendment-i/interps/266)
to private companies like Twitter.

In [two](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266326065833824257)
[tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266346957611708417)
on Friday morning, Mr. Trump complained that Twitter had not flagged
“China’s propaganda.” But the company had attached similar warning
labels two days earlier to
[tweets](https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1238111898828066823%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hindustantimes.com%2Fworld-news%2Ftwitter-flags-china-spokesman-s-tweet-on-covid-19%2Fstory-FzULY6y660dBJ1coEl2khI.html)
[posted](https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238269193427906560?lang=en)
by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, that suggested
that the coronavirus originated in the United States.

## Baseless claims about ongoing protests

Mr. Trump has dismissed the nationwide protests over the killing of
George Floyd by suggesting they are not organic or legitimate.

In three tweets, he said without evidence that the protests across the
country and in front of the White House were
“[professionally](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266724553620930561)
[organized](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266711221836931072)”
and “[have nothing to do with George
Floyd](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266731291917062145).”

While it is impossible to know the motivation of every person
participating in these demonstrations, Mr. Trump’s broad generalization
discounts the thousands who have taken to the streets specifically to
protest the killing of Mr. Floyd, a black man who died after being
handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a white police officer.

In another
[tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266800113260703744)
on Saturday, Mr. Trump said that “80% of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last
night were from OUT OF STATE.” This was [an estimate first
offered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jla3cyeuOI0) by Gov. Tim Walz
of Minnesota, a Democrat. But after reporting by
[local](https://www.twincities.com/2020/05/30/majority-of-those-arrested-in-connection-with-protests-riots-from-minnesota/)
[news
outlets](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/investigations/kare-11-investigates-records-show-arrests-mostly-minnesotans-as-george-floyd-protests-riots-continue-minneapolis-st-paul/89-73f3e0e8-0664-41d5-8d3e-4467d04da7cb)
that suggested the opposite was true, Mr. Walz [declined to
repeat](https://youtu.be/zkpOYn4J0nw?t=1387) the estimate and said that
more data was needed to properly characterize the proportion of those
arrested who were not local residents.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

These theories echoed Mr. Trump’s [previous
claims](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1048196883464818688)
that those who protested the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M.
Kavanaugh in 2018 were paid by George Soros, the billionaire investor
and Democratic donor.

Mr. Trump did not name the supposed organizers of the current protests.

## Other falsehoods

Other inaccuracies from a week of Mr. Trump’s tweets centered on
familiar foes and oft-repeated boasts.

Mr. Trump
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265301261903106054),
with no evidence, that Speaker Nancy Pelosi had complained that he had
moved too quickly in imposing some restrictions on travel from China in
response to the coronavirus. The Times was unable to find an instance of
Ms. Pelosi publicly addressing or criticizing that decision.

He repeated his claim that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had
“[apologized](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265009852516110336)”
for opposing the policy. No record of an apology exists.

He [falsely
accused](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265257673039249408)Representative
Conor Lamb, Democrat of Pennsylvania, of breaking his campaign promise
to vote against Ms. Pelosi for speaker. Mr. Lamb, who won his seat in
2018, [voted](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/roll002.xml#Kennedy) for
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts, when
the House held its election for speaker last year.

He [falsely
claimed](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266711224391213056)
on Saturday that Washington’s Democratic mayor, Muriel E. Bowser,
“wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved” in monitoring protests
outside of the White House on Friday. But the Secret Service, which Mr.
Trump praised in the same tweet, [said in a
statement](https://www.secretservice.gov/data/press/releases/2020/20-MAY/Secret-Service-Statement-on-Pennsylvania-Avenue-Demonstrations.pdf)
that it had made six arrests that night and “the Metropolitan Police
Department and the U.S. Park Police were on the scene.”

He again [took undue
credit](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265834167272603649)
for the Veterans Choice health care program. The program was created in
2014, developed by Senators John McCain and Bernie Sanders and signed by
former President Barack Obama — three of Mr. Trump’s political enemies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump’s declaration that “it was me who shattered 100% of the ISIS
Caliphate” was also not true. About a
[third](https://news.ihsmarkit.com/prviewer/release_only/slug/aerospace-defense-security-islamic-state-territory-down-60-percent-and-revenue-down-80)
to a
[half](https://web.archive.org/web/20171222214247/https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/12/276746.htm)
of the territory formerly held by the Islamic State was regained under
Mr. Obama’s administration, according to military and independent
estimates. And officials and experts had always
[anticipated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/17/us/politics/trump-islamic-state-raqqa-fact-check.html)
that the campaign, started in 2014, long before Mr. Trump took office,
would result in pushing the extremist group out of its self-declared
caliphate.

## Half truths and murky accusations

Three dozen tweets from the president occupied a factual gray zone. Some
were typical examples of political spin, neither completely true nor
totally wrong.

Twice, he claimed to have
[ban](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265301249630654467)ned
travel from China and to have done so “[before anybody thought
necessary](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265633761024188417)”
to contain the spread of the coronavirus. These were exaggerations. The
restrictions did not amount to full ban. They did not apply to American
citizens or green card holders, and they contained other exemptions.
Numerous other countries had taken similar actions before Mr. Trump did.

He misleadingly boasted of the United States having carried out 15
million coronavirus tests, “[by far the most in the
World](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265613475809763328),”
and the number of cases and deaths “[going down all over the
Country](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1264564734860427265).”
The raw number of tests, while accurate, did not reflect that the United
States continues to lag other countries in testing per capita. Cases and
deaths were decreasing across the country as a whole, but not in some
states.

Ten tweets were devoted to the announcement of grants to local transit
agencies from the Department of Transportation. Left unsaid was that
these grants have been routinely awarded since the 2013 federal fiscal
year and in the first two years of his presidency, Mr. Trump’s proposed
budgets [called for the grants to be phased
out](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46191#page=10).

Other tweets were ambiguously worded, making them difficult to fact
check even as they hint at nefarious activity.

Mr. Trump
[twice](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265819308699070464)
[said](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456)
that social media companies “attempted” and “failed” to do something in
the 2016 election, but never specified what exactly the companies
attempted. (In the past, he has [mischaracterized
research](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/19/us/politics/google-votes-election-trump.html)
to mount a baseless suggestion that Google “manipulated” votes.)

Perhaps there’s no better example of how Mr. Trump trades in vague
claims than his repeated allegations of the “greatest political crime”
or scandal in history, committed by the Obama administration to undercut
his 2016 campaign and the start of his presidency. In
[four](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265976095209373696)
[tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266017512162037761),
the president
[echoed](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265768877427851265)
[this](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1264754622830444544)
but never specified what that crime was. In others, he simply referred
to “Obamagate.”
