# In Los Angeles, the Ghosts of Rodney King and Watts Rise Again

</div>

Los Angeles has been one of America’s reference points for racial
unrest. This time protesters are bringing their anger to the people they
say need to hear it most: the white and wealthy.

LOS ANGELES — Patrisse Cullors was 8 in 1992, when Los Angeles [erupted
in
riots](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1992/05/05/us/riots-los-angeles-overview-rioting-mounted-gates-remained-political-event.html)
after four police officers were [acquitted of
assault](https://archive.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/books/98/02/08/home/rodney-verdict.html)
for the beating of Rodney King, which occurred outside a San Fernando
Valley apartment building not far from where Ms. Cullors grew up.

“I was scared as hell,” she recalled. “As children, when we would see
the police, our parents would tell us, ‘Behave, be quiet, don’t say
anything.’ There was such fear of law enforcement in this city.”

With America seized by racial unrest, as [protests convulse cities from
coast to
coast](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/us/protester-profiles-floyd-minneapolis.html)
after the death of [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/george-floyd-autopsy-michael-baden.html),
Los Angeles is on fire again. As peaceful protests in the city turned
violent over the past few days, with images of looting and burning
buildings captured by news helicopters shown late into the night, Ms.
Cullors, like many Angelenos, was pulled back to the trauma of 1992.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The parallels are easy to see: looting and destruction, fueled by anger
over police abuses; shopkeepers, with long guns, protecting their
businesses. The differences, though, between 1992 and now, are stark.
This time, the faces of the protesters are more diverse — black, white,
Latino, Asian; there has been little if any racially motivated violence
among Angelenos; and the geography of the chaos is very different, with
protesters bringing their message to Los Angeles’ largely white and rich
Westside.

“South Central has been completely quiet and peaceful,” said Ms.
Cullors, now a prominent activist and co-founder of Black Lives Matter
who organized a protest on Saturday in the Fairfax District, west of
downtown. “That’s an important distinction, that these current
situations are not happening in black communities.”

Los Angeles, in many ways, is America’s reference point for urban racial
unrest, including the [Watts riots
in 1965](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/08/11/us/50-years-after-watts-riots-a-recovery-is-in-progress.html)
and the uprising in 1992. The Rodney King beating in 1991, captured on
film, was one of the first viral videos of a black man being abused by
the police, before cellphones even existed. In those uprisings, dozens
of people were killed — 34 in 1965, and more than 40 in 1992.

Some of the most searing images from 1992 were of racially motivated
violence on the streets — the beating of Reginald Denny, a white truck
driver; gun battles between Korean shop owners and black looters. But
the mayhem largely stayed in the historically black community of South
Los Angeles and in Koreatown.

In 2013, when Black Lives Matter held its first demonstration in Los
Angeles, it was in Beverly Hills.

“We launched it there because we said, ‘Hey, our community knows about
this issue,’” Ms. Cullors said. “‘Let’s go into the heart of what is
symbolically white in Los Angeles, which is Beverly Hills. These people
need to hear our pain and our grief.’” Ms. Cullors added, “We wanted to
bring this to communities who often aren’t dealing with police
violence.”

The protest on Saturday in Fairfax stayed peaceful for hours before
descending into chaos after confrontations with the police. Looters
ransacked hip boutiques, running off with expensive sneakers. They
looted expensive purses from Alexander McQueen and tagged graffiti on
the walls and windows of Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, a symbol of
privilege and luxury.

The people turning out this time are different as well. The first rocks
and bottles hurled in the 1992 riots were in working-class black
neighborhoods, where white and Hispanic bystanders were attacked. This
time, the participants are mostly young and from diverse backgrounds and
races.

In these protests, rage and anger over racism and police abuses have
been compounded by outrage at another of America’s most profound issues
— growing income inequality. In an annual [countywide
survey](https://ucla.app.box.com/s/zy3dxv91oywq70iht1giyvlhknafjs8d) by
the Luskin School of Public Affairs at University of California, Los
Angeles, nearly two-thirds of residents under 40 said this year that the
Los Angeles area was not a place where people who worked hard could
succeed, but rather “a place where the rich keep getting richer, and the
average person cannot get ahead.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, who in 1992 was a law professor in Los Angeles living
in the Fairfax District and is now dean of the law school at University
of California, Berkeley, said he remembered explaining to his children
what was happening in 1992.

Now, he said, they are calling him from L.A. about new images on CNN of
burned-out cars and broken storefronts, stretching far more deeply into
their neighborhood than last time.

“It’s just sad,” Mr. Chemerinsky said. “It’s sad that the police
violence against African-Americans continues in the same way that
precipitated riots in the 1960s. It’s sad that we have this enormous
economic disparity that has made people so desperate. It’s sad that
there is so much anger and that we are so
divided."

For city and county officials in Los Angeles struggling to contain the
violence, the trauma of 1992 never fully healed and has rarely been far
from mind in recent days.

Hours before the city erupted in violence over the weekend, Mayor Eric
M. Garcetti tried to assure his anxious city, saying he would not need
to call on the National Guard.

“This is not 1992,” he said.

A few hours later, with chaos growing, Mr. Garcetti was on the phone
with Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking him to send in the Guard. Mr. Garcetti
made a point to say that they would not be patrolling South Los Angeles
— now predominantly Latino — an acknowledgment of the painful history,
but also largely a moot point because the streets there have been calm.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I think it’s very different from 1992 because this is a collective
national pain,” Mr. Garcetti said in an interview. “It happened in
Minneapolis on top of an incident in Louisville on top of an incident in
Georgia.”

In 1965, Mark Ridley-Thomas was an 11-year-old boy, standing on the
corner of Vernon and Hooper in South Los Angeles, watching the National
Guard roll through his neighborhood.

In 1992, as a first-term City Council member, he was at the First A.M.E.
Church awaiting the verdict in the Rodney King case. On Saturday night,
Mr. Ridley-Thomas, who is African-American and a member of the powerful
county board of supervisors, was at home because of the pandemic
watching the footage on television, and thinking about history.

“The locus of the crisis was not pinpointed in Los Angeles,” he said, of
Mr. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. “So there’s some real differences, but
the pain, the hurt, the disgust, the frustration, the anger is real and
is cumulative. So it’s not hard for people to reach back to ’92 and many
events since that
time.”

## Minneapolis Police Use Force Against Black People at 7 Times the Rate of Whites

When the officers use kicks, chokeholds, punches, takedowns, Mace spray,
Tasers and the like, the person subject to that force is black about 60
percent of the time.

George Gascon, who was a 38-year-old L.A.P.D. sergeant on the ground in
South Central in 1992, when the riots erupted at the corner of Florence
and Normandie, said he was, “brokenhearted” over the weekend watching
the television footage.

After the 1992 unrest and the Rampart corruption scandal, the L.A.P.D.
underwent a number of reforms and improved relationships with black and
brown communities. But the city still faces accusations of abuse, and to
this day, police officers are rarely prosecuted for shootings — the last
time an officer faced charges was in 2000.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“At the end of the day, as soon as the dust settles, as soon as the
fires are put out and the broken glass is fixed,” Mr. Gascon said, “we
go back to business as usual. And we go back to giving a pass over and
over and over again to a broken policing system.”

He added, “Floyd was definitely the spark, but I can tell you that there
are many Floyds in L.A. County happening all the time, just as there are
in other parts of the country.”

On Sunday, the protests moved further west, reaching Santa Monica, just
on the ocean.

Jaaye Person-Lynn, a lawyer who was out protesting there on Sunday, was
mindful of the history of Watts and Rodney King and said in an interview
with Spectrum News 1, a local news channel, that this time was
different.

“Now we are right here on the water,” he told Spectrum. “We can’t get
any further west.”

And he vowed that protesters would continue to bring their voice to
enclaves of white privilege.

“We’re going to start hitting these farmers’ markets right where people
are most comfortable,” he said. “While they are buying their gluten-free
bread and their organic tomatoes, they’re going to have to feel it the
same way we do.”
