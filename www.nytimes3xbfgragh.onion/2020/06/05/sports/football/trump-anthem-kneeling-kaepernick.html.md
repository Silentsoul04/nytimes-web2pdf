# As Trump Rekindles N.F.L. Fight, Goodell Sides With Players

</div>

The president tweeted to say it was disrespectful to kneel during the
national anthem, as Colin Kaepernick and other players began doing in
2016 to protest racial injustice. N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell then
said the league supported players peacefully protesting.

The protracted debate in the N.F.L. over [players protesting racial
injustice during the national
anthem](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/15/sports/nfl-colin-kaepernick-protests-timeline.html)
reignited with force on Friday as President Trump rekindled his war with
the league over the issue and the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell,
issued his strongest support yet for the players seeking to fight racism
and police brutality.

In a swift response to a video montage featuring star players asking the
league to address systemic racism, Goodell said he apologized for not
listening to the concerns of African-American players earlier and said
he supports the players’ right to protest peacefully. During the 2016
season, [Colin
Kaepernick](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/sports/football/nfl-protest-colin-kaepernick-activism.html)
started the movement within the league when he knelt to call attention
to racial injustice and violence by police, but no team has offered him
a contract since then.

Goodell did not directly name Kaepernick in his video. Still, his
comments were diametrically opposed to those made by the president.
Trump defended New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who said this
week that it was disrespectful to kneel during the pregame playing of
the “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

After a swift rebuke from fellow N.F.L. players, including some of his
teammates, [Brees apologized on
Thursday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/sports/football/drew-brees-apology-comments.html)
and then, in a social media post Friday night that was addressed to
Trump, issued a more forceful repudiation of his remark about
disrespect. [The president had already said on
Twitter](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE4y_9Hj2S/?igshid=7ejunv7ktpcn)
that Brees should not have bowed to pressure and that everyone should
stand when the national anthem is played.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a
hand on heart,” the president wrote. “There are other things you can
protest, but not our Great American Flag — NO KNEELING\!”

Trump first attacked the N.F.L. over [protests during the national
anthem in
September 2017](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/23/sports/football/trump-nfl-kaepernick.html).
During a campaign rally, he called on owners to fire any players who
knelt during the anthem, and used a vulgarity to describe quarterback
Colin Kaepernick, who started the movement when he knelt through the
previous season to call attention to racial injustice and police
brutality.

Kaepernick adopted the kneeling gesture on the advice of a former Green
Beret he had met, who suggested it would be a respectful way to call
attention to his cause.

A spokesman for the N.F.L. declined to comment on the president’s
comments about Brees and the national anthem.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president’s admonishment comes as the N.F.L., like the rest of the
country, grapples with how to respond to the killings of black Americans
at the hands of police, and to the protests that have engulfed the
nation for nearly two weeks since the death of George Floyd in
Minneapolis.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than any other major sports league, the N.F.L. has wrestled in
recent years with the issue of race, the lack of African-Americans and
other people of color in positions of power in the league and the rights
of players to protest social issues on the field. While three-quarters
of the league’s players are African-American, nearly every owner is
white and several of the most prominent owners are strong supporters of
the president.

In this latest wave of civil unrest, [many players, coaches and owners
have spoken
out](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-george-floyd.html)
against racism, and have pledged to become more involved in finding
solutions.

Last Saturday, Roger Goodell was the first big league commissioner to
issue a statement of concern in response to Floyd’s death, but his words
were panned as hypocritical because of the league owners’ rejection of
Kaepernick, who has not found another job in the league since the end of
the 2016 season.

On Thursday, some of the league’s biggest stars, including Kansas City
Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, [released a video calling on the
league](https://twitter.com/Cantguardmike/status/1268712743860928513) to
condemn the oppression of black people and to apologize for not
supporting players who protested peacefully.

[In his
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBE4y_9Hj2S/?igshid=7ejunv7ktpcn)
post directed at the president, Brees wrote that after conversations
with many people, he understood that “this is not an issue about the
American flag. It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn
people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black
communities.”

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Friday, [the N.F.L. also
tweeted](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1269026096034398208) the video
that the players made and said, “Players, we hear you.”

Soon after, [Goodell responded with his own
video](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1269034074552721408) in which he
made his strongest and most specific support of the demands and goals of
African-American players. In the one minute, 21-second video, the
commissioner condemned the oppression of black people, apologized for
not listening to the concerns of African-American players and encouraged
the league’s athletes to protest peacefully.

After offering his condolences to “the families who have endured police
brutality,” Goodell said that “We, the National Football League, condemn
racism and the systematic oppression of black people.”

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In an apparent allusion to Kaepernick, who [settled a grievance with the
league last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/21/sports/colin-kaepernick-nfl-settlement.html)
in which he accused the league of blackballing him because of his
political protests, Goodell added: “We, the National Football League,
admit we were wrong for not listening to N.F.L. players earlier and
encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.”

“We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter,” he
added. “I personally protest with you and want to be a part of the
much-needed change in this country. Without black players, there would
be no National Football League.”

In earlier statements, [Goodell has pointed to the league’s social
activism
campaign](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBB6ewBA-aO/?igshid=1w2oif5h7qxgi),
Inspire Change, which has donated tens of millions of dollars to groups
working in communities and pushing for the eradication of social
injustice.

But given the political volatility of the issue of the national anthem,
Goodell’s statement in support of peaceful protests could inflame the
relationship between the league and the president, who has used the
issue of protests during the national anthem to galvanize his
supporters.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the president first criticized the N.F.L. for not cracking down on
protesters, owners voted to tighten the league’s policy to prohibit
players from kneeling during the national anthem. After the [N.F.L.
Players Association filed a
grievance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/10/sports/nfl-anthem.html)
to reverse the policy, the league backed off and has never penalized a
player for protesting.

Now, Goodell has spoken in support of the players’ right to protest and
many more players have publicly called for the need for action against
racism and police brutality. Some players, [including running back
Adrian
Peterson](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/06/05/adrian-peterson-will-without-a-doubt-kneel-during-national-anthem/),
have already said they intend to kneel during the national anthem this
coming season, which does not begin until September.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the commissioner has pledged to listen and “move forward together
for a better and more united N.F.L. family,” he will have to convince
owners, broadcasters, sponsors and fans who are uncomfortable with
player protests, experts said.

“What he needs to articulate to people who buy commercials and own teams
and anyone who might push back against the players is, are there things
they are doing that are negative?” said Charles K. Ross, the author of
“Outside the Lines: African Americans and the Integration of the
N.F.L.” “You can also stand up to individuals who are going to push back
and remind them we have the First Amendment.”
