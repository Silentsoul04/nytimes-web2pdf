MINNEAPOLIS — Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council — a
veto-proof majority — pledged on Sunday to dismantle the Police
Department, promising to create a new system of public safety in a city
where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.

Saying that the city’s policing system could not be reformed, the
council members stood before hundreds of people gathered late in the day
on a grassy hill and promised to begin the process of taking apart the
Police Department as it now exists.

For activists who have been pushing for years for [drastic changes to
policing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/us/minnesota-police-george-floyd.html),
the move represented a turning point that they hope will lead to a
transformation of public safety in the city.

“It shouldn’t have taken so much death to get us here,” [Kandace
Montgomery](https://www.netrootsnation.org/profile/kandace-montgomery/),
the director of Black Visions Collective, said from the stage at the
rally. “We’re safer without armed, unaccountable patrols supported by
the state hunting black people.”

reflected [calls across America to rethink what policing looks
like](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/defund-police-floyd-protests.html).
Protesters have taken to the streets with demands to shrink or abolish
police departments, and “[defund the

has become a frequent rallying cry.

Officials in other cities, including New York, have begun to talk of
diverting some money and responsibilities from police forces to social
services agencies, but no other major city has gone as far in reaction
to the protests as the Minneapolis officials have promised to
do.

## Listen to ‘The Daily’: The Case for Defunding the Police

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Rachel Quester, Luke Vander Ploeg and Asthaa Chaturvedi; with help from Annie Brown; and edited by M.J. Davis Lin and Lisa Chow

#### Protesters across the country are calling for the abolition of policing. But what would that actually look like?

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today, several major U.S. cities are now proposing ways to defund
    and even dismantle their police departments. John Eligon on the
    thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in
    practice.
    
    It’s Tuesday, June 9.

  - archived recording (protestors)  
    (CHANTING) I can’t breathe\! I can’t breathe\!

john eligon

In the early days of the protests after George Floyd was killed —

  - archived recording (protestors)  
    (CHANTING) No justice, no peace\! No justice, no peace\!

john eligon

— it was just pure emotions and raw rage.

  - archived recording (protestors)  
    \[EXPLETIVE\] these racist \[EXPLETIVE\] police\!

john eligon

But pretty soon, once the more fiery protests and fiery unrest died
down, then we started seeing the organizers come in and talking about
what they want. And one thing we quickly saw were these face masks that
people were wearing. They were black, and they had yellow writing on
them. And they said, “Defund police.”

michael barbaro

Hmm.

john eligon

And from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.

  - archived recording (protestors)  
    (CHANTING) Defund the police\! Defund the police\!

john eligon

You start hearing, “Defund the police.”

You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people
waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of
activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and
turn it into something much larger.

  - archived recording (protestor 1)  
    Do the right thing\!

  - archived recording (protestor 2)  
    Defund the police\!

michael barbaro

So John, what do these concepts — defund, dismantle, abolish the police
— what exactly do they mean?

john eligon

To defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away
from the police department’s budget and redirect it toward other things
— whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health
agencies — that can do functions that police are often called on to do.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

john eligon

But if you fully defund it, you can get to a space where the police
department is abolished. And so essentially, what that means is that
there is no more police department as we know it. You don’t call these
men and women in blue shirts to come racing to your door with their guns
in hand. It means that they have to figure out some other form of
providing that public safety, and the police department would not be
that form.

michael barbaro

And where did these concepts come from?

john eligon

Well, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that
especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had
with policing. They see police coming into their communities to
brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really
influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else.
And we’ve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they
respond with certain reforms. We’ve seen efforts for body cameras. We’ve
seen diversifying the police departments. We’ve seen changes to the
rules on use of force.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

john eligon

But what became clear to a lot of today’s activists, and what they say
explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since
Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police
have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people
at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is
to tear it down and build something new.

michael barbaro

So John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or
abolish a police department?

john eligon

So for instance, if someone is homeless and they’re struggling on the
streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer
being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless
services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode,
then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a
health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea
behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police
officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will
reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or
killed by police officers.

michael barbaro

Right. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community
where there’s not a lot of violent crime. But every community is
different, right? And some towns, some cities — I think about New York
City, for example — have a significantly higher rate of violent crime
that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists
think about that?

john eligon

For a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about
centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke
to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially it’s going to be up to each
community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.

  - arianna nason  
    It’s going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We
    can’t decide that.

john eligon

So maybe that’s armed patrols. Maybe that’s mental health workers. Maybe
that’s some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and
people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big
ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And it’s
interesting. I had said isn’t an issue, though, with community policing
or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that
community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these
communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon
Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.

  - john eligon  
    Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type
    based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into
    the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into
    their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.

john eligon

And she took off her sunglasses. She looked at me, and she said —

  - arianna nason  
    No, I get that. And I’ll be really real with you. For me,
    personally, I don’t have all the answers for that. I don’t. And I
    wish I did. A lot of it is —

john eligon

Honestly, I don’t really know the answer to that right now.

michael barbaro

Huh.

john eligon

She was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to
say, it’s still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what
she did say is that the current system also is not working for me
either. So it’s a matter of what are they going to do differently? And
they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an
existing police department — I’m thinking, for the sake of argument,
homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual
assault or rape — do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do
they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?

john eligon

I would say, no, it’s not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to
the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even
state commission or a city commission for anywhere that’s going to come
up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are
all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with
things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and
things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not
doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the
clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable. You
had, even here in Minneapolis, there was a big scandal with all the rape
kits that they had untested. So they had a lot of issues with crimes
that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing
that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized,
trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that
aren’t necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said,
maybe there’s still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of
their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some
sort of active violence, you don’t need police for. So in some people’s
eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people
who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police,
even, they make it clear that they don’t just want a system in which
it’s police in another name, police with another uniform on.

\[music\]

And these demands to defund the police, they’ve actually been brewing in
Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in
2015, there’s been several local activist groups working on it. And
those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was
probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

  - archived recording (protestors)  
    (CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.\!

john eligon

So there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of
the mayor Jacob Frey’s house.

  - archived recording (protestors)  
    Abolish the M.P.D.\! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting.
    They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to
    the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up
    to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group
    called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was
    standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the
    mayor.

  - archived recording (kandace montgomery)  
    Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will
    you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department?

  - archived recording (jacob frey)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\]

john eligon

And you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this
is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very
ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.

  - archived recording (kandace montgomery)  
    Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department?

  - archived recording  
    \[CROWD MURMURING\]

  - archived recording (kandace montgomery)  
    All right, be quiet y’all. Be quiet, because it’s important that we
    actually hear this. It’s important that we hear this, because if
    y’all don’t know, he’s up for re-election next year.

  - archived recording  
    \[CROWD CHEERING\]

john eligon

And then —

  - archived recording (jacob frey)  
    I do not support the full abolition of the police department.

  - archived recording (kandace montgomery)  
    All right\!

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    You’re wasting our time\! Get the \[EXPLETIVE\] out of here\!

john eligon

And he gives his answer — he does not support full abolition of the
police.

  - archived recording (crowd)  
    (CHANTING) Go home, Jacob, go home\! Go home, Jacob, go home\!

john eligon

And he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of
people.

  - archived recording (crowd)  
    (CHANTING) Shame\! Shame\! Shame\! Shame\! Shame\! Shame\! Shame\!
    Shame\! Shame\!

john eligon

So after this event, there was already an event planned for the
following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which
they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their
cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they
were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the
police.

michael barbaro

So a lot like what they had done to the mayor?

john eligon

Exactly.

  - archived recording (lisa bender)  
    Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. I’m Lisa Bender. I’m
    the president of the Minneapolis City Council.

john eligon

And so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.

  - archived recording (lisa bender)  
    Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.

john eligon

And you had council members.

  - archived recording (lisa bender)  
    Our commitment is to do what’s necessary to keep every single member
    of our community safe, and to tell the truth that the Minneapolis
    Police are not doing that. \[CROWD CHEERS\]

john eligon

And you had nine of them who went up on the stage.

  - archived recording (council member 1)  
    We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis
    Police Department. \[CROWD CHEERS\]

john eligon

And then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the
police.

  - archived recording (council member 2)  
    All of us on this stage support this statement, and we stand with
    the people of Minneapolis in fighting for a safer community. \[CROWD
    CHEERS\]

john eligon

The last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to
this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\], get up, y’all. We are transforming our city right
    now. Get up\! get

john eligon

You had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their
fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.

  - archived recording (crowd)  
    (CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.\! Defund M.P.D.\! Defund M.P.D.\!

michael barbaro

So just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a
pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police —
to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24
hours before.

john eligon

Yes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police.
It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these
are putting them all on record in front of many community members,
saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists
about that. I said, we’ve heard politicians say things before and not
keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw they’ve been
working on with them together in tandem. So I think there’s a level of
trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could
see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really
describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act
moment.

michael barbaro

Wow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that
park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away
funding from the police department?

john eligon

Yes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council
actually controls the police department’s budget. And what’s more
significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them,
those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor,
Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks
together, they can do this on their own. And I think what we’re seeing
is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we
already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those
cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds
that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward
other agencies in the city.

michael barbaro

I’m curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is,
beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and
mayors, and where this is now under discussion.

john eligon

That’s a very key question, right? We’re already seeing conservatives
coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical
leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about
it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities,
something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a
very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does
or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than
what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of
Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So it’s going to be, in some ways, a
patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening
around the country.

michael barbaro

And I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the
mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you
and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support
defunding the police.

john eligon

Yeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or
moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who
might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and
you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working — which
is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are
about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the
more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not
result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support
more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So we’ll see
what happens.

michael barbaro

I wonder how the activists that you’re talking to see the challenge of
explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this
moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls — defund,
dismantle, abolish — for the first time. And they may be very wary of
them, and they may see them as quite radical.

john eligon

What the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical
for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large
section of this country.

  - john eligon  
    What was your name, sir?

  - yahzerah brazelton  
    Yaazirah

  - john eligon  
    How do you spell that?

  - yahzerah brazelton  
    Y-A-H- —

john eligon

If you go to black and brown communities — like I went up to the North
Side of Minneapolis — and you talk to people about their experiences
with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer
to come and help you. It’s exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with
a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.

  - yahzerah brazelton  
    It’s about time for a change.

  - amanda brazelton  
    A change, yeah.

  - yahzerah brazelton  
    Yeah. About time for a change.

john eligon

And they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they
already had horrific experiences with the police.

  - yahzerah brazelton  
    \[INAUDIBLE\] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven
    years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing,
    just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.

john eligon

Yaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when
his parents were having an argument.

  - yahzerah brazelton  
    And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.

john eligon

And then they stuck a gun in his face.

  - yahzerah brazelton  
    They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white
    police officers since.

john eligon

And his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people,
and she’s black.

  - amanda brazelton  
    We were driving in the car. All my white friends got out. And as
    soon as I got out, they pulled guns, yelled at —

john eligon

And when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but
then they pulled guns on her.

  - amanda brazelton  
    I’m 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing
    wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that
    interaction.

john eligon

And so the way they see the police department is not a force where you
call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.

  - amanda brazelton  
    Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because
    of what they’ve seen.

john eligon

It’s one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins
with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once,
she didn’t call the police, but she called family and friends.

  - amanda brazelton  
    And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called
    my dad, my mom, before called the police.

john eligon

Why didn’t you call the police?

  - amanda brazelton  
    Because they kill black people. They’ll call me, I’ll get killed in
    my own home.

john eligon

So it’s already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many
black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only
exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to
protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared
that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their
communities and just rampant violence, they’re saying, no, this will
create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just
for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the
country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as
a radical idea, who can’t envision a world without police, they’re
asking them to just walk in these people’s shoes, understand what
they’re going through.

    The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of
    our city to stand together to make this commitment, we don’t have
    all the answers.

michael barbaro

In an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City
Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the city’s
police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely
take years.

  - archived recording (lisa bender)  
    And if you look back at the last 150 years of our police department,
    it is becoming increasingly clear that that model of policing isn’t
    working. I hope it won’t take 150 years to get to that looking
    forward, that next solution. But we have a lot of wisdom in our
    community. We have invested in \[INAUDIBLE\] —

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (karen bass)  
    Good morning, everyone. The Justice in Policing Act establishes a
    bold, transformative vision of policing in America.

michael barbaro

On Monday, Congressional Democrats introduced the most sweeping federal
plan to reform the police in modern memory.

  - archived recording (karen bass)  
    Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw
    on the streets in Minneapolis — the slow murder of an individual by
    a uniformed police officer.

michael barbaro

The legislation would reduce the legal protections that now shield
police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would
impose new restrictions to prevent police officers from using deadly
force. The measure is expected to quickly pass in the House, where
there’s a Democratic majority, but faces an uncertain future in the
Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, state-level reforms continue.
On Monday, New York’s legislature banned the use of chokeholds by police
and repealed a statute that effectively hid the disciplinary records of
police officers.

And —

  - archived recording (dr. tedros adhonom)  
    Almost 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to W.H.O.,
    and almost 400,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is
    improving, globally, it’s worsening.

michael barbaro

The World Health Organization said that the number of new daily
infections from the coronavirus hit a record high — more than 136,000 on
Sunday — and warned that mass protests in places like the U.S. could
further spread the virus.

  - archived recording (dr. tedros adhonom)  
    We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely.
    Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a
    protest.

Finally, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that because of
the pandemic, the United States economy officially entered a recession
in February, ending the longest economic expansion on record. It began
in 2009 and lasted 128 months.

Council members said in interviews on Sunday that they did not yet have
specific plans to announce for what a new public safety system for the
city would look like. They promised to develop plans by working with the
community, and said they would draw on past studies, consent decrees and
reforms to policing across the nation and the world.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Protesters who gathered at the windswept rally, with a view of
Powderhorn Lake, said what mattered most was that elected officials had
finally committed to a sweeping overhaul of policing, even though they
had not offered specifics of how a dismantling would work.

“There needs to be change,” said Paola Lehman, a 23-year-old actor and
educator in Minneapolis.

As the council members each read a line of the pledge to the crowd,
Wintana Melekin, 32, clasped her hands above her head wrap, her mouth
open in stunned silence beneath a sagging mask with the inscription
“Defund Police.”

“I knew it was happening, but I didn’t believe it,” she said.

When the final portion was read, a roar went up among the hundreds in
the crowd. Many people raised their fists in the air and chanted,
“Defund M.P.D.\!”

Though the City Council controls the police budget, the department
answers to Mayor Jacob Frey, who has a veto over the Council’s actions.
Council members said they had enough votes to override a veto by Mr.
Frey, who was booed out of a rally by hundreds of people on Saturday
after he said he did not believe in abolishing the Police Department.
Mr. Frey quietly exited through an angry crowd as many shouted “Go home,
Jacob Frey\!” and “Shame\! Shame\!”

Councilwoman Alondra Cano, who leads the Council’s public safety
committee, said that scene made her think about the need to create space
for discussions — a truth and reconciliation commission of sorts — to
develop solutions to the city’s policing issues.

“Protesting is good and needed, press conferences are good and needed,”
she said. “That third space is needed where we are committed to each
other, and not the camera.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Frey said on Sunday that while he opposed dismantling the Police
Department, he would “work relentlessly” with the city’s police chief
and the community “toward deep, structural reform and addressing
systemic racism in police culture.” He added that he was “ready to dig
in and enact more community-led public safety strategies.”

The City Council voted on Friday to accept a civil rights investigation
of the police by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and to amend
the Police Department’s use-of-force policy to ban chokeholds, among
other measures.

Protesters’ cries to defund or abolish the police are often not meant
literally. Rather, they are demands to rethink a law enforcement system
from the ground up and to grapple with deeply ingrained issues,
including employing officers who do not live in the city they police —
as is done in Minneapolis — and sending armed officers to respond to
situations that turn out not to be crimes, as when a mentally ill person
is in distress.

Some proposals have focused on ending heavy-handed police tactics like
no-knock search warrants and military-style raids on the homes of
suspects, restricting the flow of military gear to police departments
and banning the use of military equipment on protesters.

A common thread has been the tendency of police departments to consume
ever larger shares of city budgets.

“We’re really saying we want to grow our community, and we want to
invest in the things we actually need,” said Ms. Montgomery, who led the
protest on Saturday and grilled Mr. Frey on his views, leading to the
chants that prompted him to leave the scene.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Council members and activists pointed to examples of different styles of
policing in places like Austin, Texas, where the operators who answer
911 calls inquire whether a caller needs police, fire or mental health
services before dispatching a response, and in Eugene, Ore., where a
medic and a crisis worker with mental health training are dispatched to
emergency calls.

Many have called for relying more on self-policing by the community, in
the way attendees often do at events like music festivals, with the
police stepping in only when a true emergency arises. Some cited as an
example how, in the days after the killing of Mr. Floyd, [teams made up
of dozens of members of the American Indian
Movement](https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-residents-step-up-to-protect-their-neighborhoods-from-little-earth-to-longfellow/570910552/)
patrolled streets and directed traffic in the Little Earth housing
community in Minneapolis.

Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter and chair of Reform
L.A. Jails, said the move by the Minneapolis City Council members had
shifted the movement to rethink policing from the fringe to the
mainstream.

“This is massive,” Ms. Cullors said. “This is the first time we are
seeing, in our country’s history, a conversation about defunding, and
some people having a conversation about abolishing the police and prison
state. This must be what it felt like when people were talking about
abolishing slavery.”

Many advocates note that city budgets are already strained by the
coronavirus pandemic, which shut down business and tourism, sharply
reducing tax revenue, and that police budgets may be especially
vulnerable.

The city of Minneapolis is looking to cut $200 million from its $1.3
billion overall budget, according to Lisa Bender, the president of the
City Council. She said she hoped to reallocate some money from policing,
which received $189 million in the 2020 budget, to other areas of need
in the city.

Councilman Jeremiah Ellison, who represents North Minneapolis, said he
would not frame what the Council was doing as defunding the police, but
rather as “funding a different safety strategy.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said: “Is the goal to execute some kind of vendetta against M.P.D?
No.”

Lt. Bob Kroll, the president of the Minneapolis Police Union, did not
respond to requests for comment.

Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police
Association, said he supported reforming rather than defunding the
police. While he welcomed additional investment in social services for
mental health, domestic violence and homelessness, he said, the
traditional police force “is an essential service and must still be
funded.”

“When someone is in immediate danger, fearing for his or her life, would
these victims still have a place to call and a person who is willing and
able to help?” he asked. “If so, then we’re open to more discussions.”

Activists have been calling for change in the Minneapolis Police
Department for a long time. Outrage over police killings prompted many
of the current City Council members to run for office.

“We [warned them years
ago](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/24/why-activists-predicted-months-ago-that-minneapolis-could-become-the-next-ferguson/\))
that this will become the next Ferguson,” Nekima Levy-Armstrong,
president of the Racial Justice Network, said of city officials. “They
didn’t listen.”

Ms. Levy-Armstrong said she was worried about completely abolishing the
Police Department, fearing that city leaders would make decisions
without sufficient input from minority communities.

“If they want to disband the police,” she said, “they need to come up
with ways and methods to keep our people safe.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the accusations of police brutality through the years, the failed
past attempts at reform and then the horrific footage of Mr. Floyd’s
killing — as well as the police response to protests that has included
rubber bullets and tear gas — major changes to policing in Minneapolis
are now inevitable, said Kenza Hadj-Moussa, a spokeswoman for TakeAction
Minnesota, an advocacy group.

“No one feels safe calling the police, period,” she said. “They’re not
doing their basic function of public safety.”
