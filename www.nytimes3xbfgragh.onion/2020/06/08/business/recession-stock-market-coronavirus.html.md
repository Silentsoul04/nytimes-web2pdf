# Despite Recession, Stock Markets Turn Positive for the Year

The S\&P 500 climbed back above where it began the year on the same day

And just like that, we’re back to where we started.

The S\&P 500, a leading stock market index, on Monday climbed back above
where it began the year — before the pandemic brought the United States
economy to a juddering halt, before more than 110,000 Americans died
from the coronavirus, and before the police killing of George Floyd in
Minneapolis set off nationwide protests.

A [late-day
rally](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html)
pushed the index into positive territory for 2020, effectively erasing
one of the most tumultuous periods in recent American history from the
financial record. Stocks rose 1.2 percent — on the same day that
economists said the [United States fell into a recession in
February](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/business/economy/us-economy-recession-2020.html).

Even though the economy has begun to reopen, it is hard to overstate how
disastrous the past three months have been and what the long-term
consequences are for everything, from the nature of work to the future
of certain industries. Tens of millions of people are unemployed,
corporate earnings have plummeted, and industries such as tourism,
retail and entertainment might never fully recover from the blow dealt
to their businesses.

But in the stock market, it’s like the pandemic never happened.

“Investors seem to have decided that the past three months were just a
bad dream that we’re waking up from,” said Scott Clemons, chief
investment strategist for private banking at Brown Brothers Harriman, an
investment bank.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After an initial few weeks of volatility, when the market dropped 34
percent, it has become inured to the near-daily drumbeat of bad news.
When the Commerce Department announced on April 29 that the economy
shrank at a nearly 5 percent annual rate, its [fastest drop since
the 2008
recession](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/business/economy/us-gdp.html),
stocks rose 2.7 percent.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>A
month ago, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics published what was
essentially the [worst employment report on
record](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/08/business/economy/april-jobs-report.html)
— showing that more than 20 million jobs disappeared in April as
unemployment surged to 14.7 percent, the highest since the Great
Depression — stocks rose 1.7
percent.

So, why is the market behaving this way?

In large part, it was the actions of the federal government. Early on,
the Federal Reserve stretched its financial safety net wide, [announcing
it would provide a
backstop](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/19/business/too-big-to-fail-wall-street-businesses.html)
by using its emergency lending powers to buy assets — from municipal to
corporate debt — with newly printed money. Also, it began snapping up
government-backed bonds through a newly unlimited buying campaign. That
had the effect of keeping bond prices up and yields, which move in the
opposite direction of prices, low. And so investors, looking for better
returns, began putting their money into the stock market instead,
creating upward pressure on prices.

“It’s the only way that you can kind of explain what’s going on, is that
people really do believe that there is no downside in equity ownership,”
said James Montier, a member of the asset allocation team at Grantham,
Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company, a Boston-based asset management company.

Since March 23, the Dow Jones industrial average has soared 48 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted toward technology,
is up 45 percent and closed at a record high on Monday, as investors bet
that tech behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft were well positioned to
benefit from stay-at-home orders around the country. The S\&P 500 is
also up nearly 45 percent.

“I understand fully the recovery in the market, I just think it’s ahead
of schedule,” said Leon Cooperman, the founder of the hedge fund Omega
Advisors, which [in 2018 announced it would convert to a family office
to mainly manage the billionaire’s personal
fortune](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/23/business/dealbook/leon-cooperman-hedge-fund.html).
“It’s ahead of schedule because of the government’s policy of giving out
free money.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Cooperman was referring to the flood of money — from both the Fed
and the government itself — that has been pumped into the economy and
markets.

Since the Fed first took steps to stabilize the markets in March, it has
created roughly $2.9 trillion, the vast majority of which has gone into
financial markets. Separately, the federal government has said it would
borrow a record-breaking $3 trillion from April to June, much of which
will be channeled to businesses and consumers to keep them afloat during
the shutdown.

The biggest winners in the stock market rally have been companies whose
very existence earlier appeared imperiled by the crisis, with investors
now swooping in to buy the most battered shares in hopes of generating
the biggest gains.

As oil prices stabilized since the worst of the sell-off this year, the
stock price of the Apache Corporation, an oil driller, quadrupled. Stock
in the oil field services giant Halliburton has tripled. (Both still
remain down for the year.) The cruise operators Norwegian and Royal
Caribbean are both up more than 150 percent. The S\&P’s energy sector
stocks have risen more than 90 percent, while consumer discretionary
stocks and financials are both up roughly 50 percent.

Although it’s well known that market activity is a leading indicator of
economic recovery — and investors right now are excited about the
reopening of states and [the recent May jobs
report](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/business/economy/jobs-report.html)
— skeptics caution that investors may have become overly bullish.

“Right now the market thinks we’ll have a V-shaped recovery and a
vaccine by the end of the year and I think both of those views are too
optimistic,” said Byron Wien, a longtime market observer and the vice
chairman of the private wealth group at Blackstone.

While Mr. Wien believes the economy is recovering, he thinks it will be
a slow return to normal.

Wall Street analysts don’t expect that corporate profits for S\&P 500
companies will return to 2019 levels until 2021. But the market rally
has effectively already priced in all those gains, in part, some say,
because of the government actions. Even after accounting for the
government’s support, there are significant risks facing investors that
could stop S\&P 500 companies from generating the profits they did
before the virus reached American shores.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent years, large companies have bought back hundreds of billions
of dollars’ worth of stock through share repurchase programs. Such
programs helped prop up stock prices. But as companies become more
cautious, analysts expect them to instead conserve their cash, removing
a key support for share prices.

Economic and political tensions between the United States and China —
the world’s two largest economies — also remain high, after the two
superpowers engaged in a disruptive on-again-off-again trade war over
the last two years. A renewed flurry of tariffs could further complicate
the recovery for large American corporations as well as the global
economy. Such tensions may also be more likely to re-emerge ahead of
what could be a contentious presidential election in November.

Then, there is the prospect of a second wave of the pandemic, which
could set back the economy once more.

But despite these potential challenges, market investors appear almost
wholly unconcerned.

“I think the market is best described as the way people think about
second marriages,” said Mr. Wien, 87 years old, who has been watching
stocks on Wall Street since 1965. “It’s a triumph of hope over
experience.”
