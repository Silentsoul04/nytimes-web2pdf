# Biden Walks a Cautious Line as He Opposes Defunding the Police

As gruesome videos and energetic protests reshape public opinion about
racial discrimination, Joe Biden tried to balance protesters’ calls for
a law enforcement overhaul while not alienating moderate voters.

Former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html)
staked out a careful position on Monday in support of a law enforcement
overhaul but not [defunding police
departments](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/us/politics/democrats-biden-defund-police.html),
rebutting a new Republican attack line as he tries to harness growing
activism against systemic racism while not alienating protesters or more
moderate voters.

In the face of continuing protest marches calling to “defund the police”
nationwide in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing, [Mr.
Biden’s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/politics/joe-biden-black-vice-president.html)
campaign said in a statement that he “hears and shares the deep grief
and frustration of those calling out for change” and that he “supports
the urgent need for reform.” But a campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates,
said flatly that Mr. Biden was opposed to cutting police funding and
believed more spending was necessary to help improve law enforcement and
community policing.

Mr. Biden’s effort to address the calls of protesters while supporting
law enforcement comes after gruesome videos and energetic protests have
quickly reshaped public opinion about racial discrimination, seemingly
opening a substantial window for new policies that could bring
far-reaching change to law-enforcement agencies long accused of racially
discriminatory practices. But there are already signs of division
between activists who are eager to dismantle police departments and
congressional Democrats who favor a less drastic overhaul of law
enforcement.

[President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)’s
campaign and leading Republicans have sought to drive a wedge between
the immediate-but-incremental calls for change among elected Democrats
and the more sweeping demands that protesters are calling for in places
like Minneapolis, where the death of Mr. Floyd after police officers
pinned him down has prompted worldwide calls for racial justice.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump, for his part, has not endorsed any new changes to policing
procedures or funding. On Monday, he met with law enforcement officials
at the White House and praised<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>them, saying virtually all police officers were “great, great
people” and boasting on Twitter that crime was low nationwide.

The debate within the Democratic Party was on plain display on Monday,
as congressional leaders [unveiled a broad legislative
program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/us/politics/democrats-police-misconduct-bill-protests.html)
on policing, including new limits on the use of lethal force and on the
legal protections afforded to officers accused of misconduct. Only hours
before, progressives at the municipal level in Minneapolis pledged on
Sunday to [take apart the city’s long-troubled Police
Department](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-police-abolish.html)
and rebuild it altogether.

Asked by the CBS host Norah O’Donnell on Monday if he supported
defunding the police, Mr. Biden answered: “No, I don’t support defunding
the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on
whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and
honorableness.”

Mr. Biden’s position — a stance on policing that another prominent
Democrat, Bill Clinton, might have summed up as “mend it, don’t end it”
— aligned him far more closely with lawmakers in Washington than with
activists and left-wing lawmakers at the municipal level. His approach
drew wide support from Democratic Party officials and a number of civil
rights leaders, as well as politicians in the swing states likeliest to
decide the general election.

That’s in part because few Democrats have embraced activist demands to
make deep cuts to police budgets or to shutter local law-enforcement
agencies altogether. Answering those calls, most party leaders have
tried to mingle sympathy for the underlying grievances of police critics
with Biden-style rejection of ideas like police abolition.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We need police officers, and we need law enforcement,” said Bob
Buckhorn, the former mayor of Tampa, Fla., and a supporter of Mr.
Biden’s. “They are oftentimes the only thing between good and evil,
and between chaos and calm.”

Mr. Buckhorn said policymakers needed to address legitimate “built-up
anger,” but he also cautioned, “Anybody who is suggesting that they
defund the police, whatever that means, I think would be making a
terrible mistake.”

Even a number of progressive Democrats do not think Mr. Biden should
suddenly veer left.

Several young black leaders said Mr. Biden should pursue a criminal
justice overhaul, and seek out and elevate activists who are organizing
peaceful demonstrations.

“That puts him in front of people he’s not usually in front of and
demonstrates what kind of leader he is,” Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II of
Michigan said.

Quentin James, who runs an organization dedicated to electing
African-American officials, said, “I don’t think we need him to say
‘defund police,’ but he can help lift up groups like Collective PAC
that are trying to elect reform-minded prosecutors.”

Mr. Trump’s attempts to mount a soft-on-crime campaign against Mr. Biden
may prove difficult. The 2020 presidential election, after all, is not
Mr. Biden’s first attempt to balance the public’s appetite for change
with deeply rooted conservatism in much of the country.

He channeled the rage of young voters who were furious about Vietnam and
Watergate to claim a Senate seat in Delaware in the same year that
Richard M. Nixon won a 49-state re-election landslide thanks to the
perceived excesses of the Democratic left and its presidential nominee,
George McGovern.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ever since, Mr. Biden, 77, has carefully balanced the passions of
activists with the sensibilities of the political center, portraying
himself as both a champion for racial equality and a reliable ally of
law enforcement.

His statement on Monday and a speech he gave last week in Philadelphia
reflected the impulses of someone who, for much of his career,
represented a state that was politically competitive and split between a
heavily urban northern tier and its so-called “slower lower” rural
south.

Mr. Biden’s positioning also owes to his grounding in a Senate where
forging consensus was a necessity even if it meant, [as he memorably
noted last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/us/politics/biden-segregationists.html),
working with segregationists.

Such comments infuriated many Democrats during the party’s presidential
primary race, especially younger progressives who, at their most
charitable, viewed him as a well-meaning if out-of-touch relic from
yesteryear.

Yet then as now Mr. Biden has been greatly aided by Mr. Trump, whose
divisive message and conduct have only alienated up-for-grabs voters who
are craving stability. At this stage in the campaign, voters are
comparing Mr. Biden — to borrow a Bidenism — not to the Almighty but to
the alternative, and so far Mr. Trump has offered little to Americans
seeking a sympathetic and textured response to the crisis.

Mr. Biden is also finding it easier to stake out ground in support of
overhauling the police because the [polling has shifted considerably on
the
issue](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/politics/polling-george-floyd-protests-racism.html),
making it harder for Mr. Trump to gain much leverage from his repeated
calls for “law and order.”

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicated that just 27 percent
of voters said they were more worried about the protests, some of which
have turned violent, than about the death of Mr. Floyd and police
conduct. Among white voters, that figure was just 30 percent.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“With the video footage we are now seeing, even the typical voter who’s
all for law and order is not going to be able to ignore the fact that in
some police departments, in the department themselves, they lack law and
order,” said Representative Anthony G. Brown, Democrat of Maryland.  
  
Mr. Brown likened this moment to the violence that law enforcement
inflicted on civil rights protesters in the 1960s, which he said was
when “decent Americans woke up and said, ‘Hey, that’s wrong, we have to
do something.’”

Just as there were divisions in the civil rights movement between older
leaders and younger, more radical activists, however, some of the same
generational differences exist today.

“I’ve seen this in neighborhood meetings where a young person will come
in and say, ‘We have too many police officers here,’ and I’ll see a
senior saying, ‘Oh, no, no, that’s not true,’” said Mayor Nan Whaley of
Dayton, Ohio, a Democrat.

This split has also found its way into the ranks of Democratic
lawmakers. On Monday, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina
— who is now the highest-ranking black member of Congress but, in his
youth, was jailed during protests — complained on a private conference
call with other lawmakers about those trying to “hijack” the swelling
movement with calls to defund the police.

Later on the call, however, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of
New York, 30, warned against actions that would “demoralize or undercut”
protest leaders, according to a House Democratic official familiar with
the conversation.

Mr. Biden has sought to avoid inflaming either constituency. In his
speech last week, he was blunt that the story of America “isn’t a fairy
tale.” Yet he invoked the Civil War, the Great Depression and often
bloody civil rights protests to argue that “in some of our darkest
moments of despair, we’ve made some of our greatest progress.”

Representative Colin Allred of Texas said that recalling past crises and
the progress that emerged from them was a way to assure voters that
better days are ahead while also recalling pre-Trump presidential
leadership — “a call for change and a call for restoration,” as Mr.
Allred, a Democrat, put it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the swing state of Nevada, Chris Giunchigliani, a Democratic former
member of the Clark County Commission, warned her party that incremental
improvements to policing would not be enough. Making a few changes at
the federal level and then declaring victory, she said, might “give
people false hope that things are fixed,” when an overhaul would require
meticulous work at the state and local level.

“To folks who want to defund: You need a police department, I think
that’s reasonable,” said Ms. Giunchigliani, a former candidate for
governor. “But I think it’s time to take a step back and work on: What
should policing in the community be?”

As encouraging as the polling on police issues is for Democrats right
now, many in the party are wary of putting too much confidence in the
expressions of support from white voters who have historically recoiled
from seeing public officials at odds with law enforcement.

Partly for that reason, black leaders are eager to see Democrats press
hard in the coming weeks for the moderate slate of policy changes
proposed on Monday, in the hope that they could be passed swiftly in an
environment that is favorable but could turn out to be fragile.

Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, said he
believed the country was at a “transformative moment,” in which the
killing of Mr. Floyd had shaken white voters from passive sympathy to
active support for overhauling law enforcement.

“I think there’s always been support there, but I think it’s been
muted,” said Mr. Morial, who served two terms as mayor of New Orleans.
Now, he said, there’s a new majority and it’s not at all silent.
