# How Times Reporters Handle Scientific Studies

</div>

When is research considered reliable? The answer isn’t always fully
known. Here’s the approach our journalists take in evaluating studies
and their
results.

[*Times
Insider*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/times-insider)
*explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes
insights into how our journalism comes together.*

After early studies showed promising results of the anti-malarial drug
[hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html)
in coronavirus patients, President Trump quickly [promoted it as a
possible
treatment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/05/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html)
and later announced that he was [taking the
drug](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-coronavirus.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur)
as a preventive measure.

But publishers of the [study from France that Mr. Trump had
referenced](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996)
said that it fell short of their
[standards](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/06/hydroxychlorine-covid-19-study-did-not-meet-publishing-societys-expected-standard/),
while
[researchers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056424v2)
in Brazil examining the related drug chloroquine [halted their
research](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/12/health/chloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html?smid=em-share)
after patients given high doses developed potentially fatal heart
arrhythmias. Throughout its coverage, The Times has cited scientists’
reservations about the drug’s effectiveness and [reported last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/health/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html)
that the [first controlled
study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2016638) of the drug
found it did not prevent infections in people exposed to the virus.

The [misjudgments about
hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-.html)
underscore the importance of how reporters at The Times cover scientific
research: They study the study, and tell readers what’s known and what’s
not. Even as scientists work feverishly to answer questions about the
[pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu),
science reporters carefully parse fact from conjecture, truth from
folly.

That’s necessary now especially because “there’s a flood of new science,
much of it seat-of-the-pants,” said [Celia W.
Dugger](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/celia-w-dugger), the
health and science
editor.

Before you read about a study in The Times, reporters will have looked
into the researchers’ backgrounds and often consulted three to five
outside experts to determine the quality of the work. Reporters also ask
questions like: What are the margins of error? Did the study include
enough patients to get meaningful results? And what are the shortcomings
of the research?

Historically, reporters have considered studies published by major
science journals — like Nature, The Lancet and The New England Journal
of Medicine — to be the most reliable, because those publications use
expert editors and rigorously vet research methods and conclusions by
sending them to other scientists to evaluate.

But last week, both The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine
[retracted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/health/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine.html?searchResultPosition=4)
big coronavirus studies because they were based on data that could not
be verified. The Times had reported on [one of those
studies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/health/malaria-drug-trump-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=2).

Cases like this highlight the need for vigilance. Before citing such
research, Times reporters will generally seek out independent experts to
comment. That’s critical now because during the pandemic, the length of
time from experiment to published study has been “short-circuited,” said
[Mike
Mason](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/06/insider/cuba-illness-sonic-weapons.html),
a deputy science editor, adding that what once took as long as a year
and a half has been shortened in some cases to weeks.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now many researchers post their work online in what is known as a
[preprint](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/science/coronavirus-disinformation.html?smid=em-share),
or a study that gets released **** without the standard practice of peer
review. Some preprints contain observational or anecdotal work that
doesn’t meet more exacting scientific standards like randomly selected
patients or control groups enabling more definitive conclusions. Times
reporters who write about preprints try to make clear to readers what
the research shows and what it leaves unanswered.

Those outside the field have rarely paid attention to these preprint
studies — until now. Politicians and everyday citizens sometimes look to
studies in their infancy.

Reporters are not looking for the perfect study — science is not
definitive and even the highest quality research has limitations. But
“right now, with all these reports pouring out, there’s more
uncertainty than usual,” said [Denise
Grady](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/denise-grady), a science
reporter. “That’s hard for everybody to accept at a time when we all
wish there were answers and a clear way forward.”

The Times’s guidelines recognize that reporters must balance the weight
that they give to such studies with the need to provide information
about those that wind up in the global conversation.

“We will do everything we can to be straight with readers about what we
know and what we don’t know,” said Ms. Dugger. “Science isn’t the
discovery of a final truth or the be-all-end-all. It’s a process. Our
knowledge will get better as we go along, but it’s still worth sharing
with people the evolution of what we know.”
