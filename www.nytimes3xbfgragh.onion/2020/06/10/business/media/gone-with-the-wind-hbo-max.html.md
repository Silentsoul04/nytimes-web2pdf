HBO Max has removed from its catalog “[Gone With the
Wind](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/movies/olivia-de-havilland-dead.html),”
the 1939 movie long considered a triumph of American cinema but one that
romanticizes the Civil War-era South while glossing over its racial
sins.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The streaming service pledged to eventually bring the film back “with a
discussion of its historical context” while denouncing its racial
missteps, a spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday.

Set on a plantation and in Atlanta, the film won multiple Academy
Awards, including best picture and best supporting actress for Hattie
McDaniel, [the first African-American to win an
Oscar](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/oscars-first-black-winner-accepted-774335),
and it remains among the most celebrated movies in cinematic history.
But its rose-tinted depiction of the antebellum South and its blindness
to the horrors of slavery have long been criticized, and that scrutiny
was renewed this week as protests over police brutality and the death of
George Floyd continued to pull the United States into a wide-ranging
conversation about race.

“‘Gone With the Wind’ is a product of its time and depicts some of the
ethnic and racial prejudices that have, unfortunately, been commonplace
in American society,” an HBO Max spokesperson said in a statement.
“These racist depictions were wrong then and are wrong today, and we
felt that to keep this title up without an explanation and a
denouncement of those depictions would be irresponsible.”

[HBO
Max](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/business/media/hbo-max-netflix-streaming.html),
owned by AT\&T, pulled the film on Tuesday, one day after John Ridley,
the screenwriter of “12 Years a Slave,” wrote [an op-ed in The Los
Angeles
Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-06-08/hbo-max-racism-gone-with-the-wind-movie)
calling for its removal. Mr. Ridley said he understood that films were
snapshots of their moment in history, but that “Gone With the Wind” was
still used to “give cover to those who falsely claim that clinging to
the iconography of the plantation era is a matter of ‘heritage, not
hate.’”

“It is a film that, when it is not ignoring the horrors of slavery,
pauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people
of color,” he wrote.

By several measures, the film was one of the most successful in American
history. It received eight competitive Academy Awards and remains the
highest-grossing film ever when adjusting for inflation. In 2007, it
placed sixth on the American Film Institute’s [list of greatest films of
all
time](https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/).

There was little criticism of the film when it was released, though in
1939 an editorial board member of The Daily Worker, a newspaper
published by the Communist Party USA, called it “[an insidious
glorification of the slave
market](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1939/12/24/archives/red-paper-condemns-gone-with-the-wind-terms-the-film-a.html)”
and the Ku Klux Klan.

But the world in which it is viewed has changed, and with each decade
[discomfort has
grown](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/12/gone-with-the-wind-and-hollywoods-racial-politics/377919/)
as people revisit its racial themes and what was omitted. In 2017, the
Orpheum theater in Memphis [said it would stop showing the
film](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/27/movies/memphis-theater-cancels-gone-with-the-wind-screening.html),
as it had done each year for 34 years, after receiving complaints from
patrons and other commenters. The president of the theater said it could
not show a film “that is insensitive to a large segment of its local
population.”

Based on a 1936 book by Margaret Mitchell, the film chronicles the love
affair of Scarlett O’Hara, the daughter of a plantation owner, and Rhett
Butler, a charming gambler. Critics have long said that the slaves are
depicted as well-treated, content and loyal to their masters, a trope
that rewrites the reality of how enslaved people were forced to live.
Ms. McDaniel [won an
Oscar](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/oscars-first-black-winner-accepted-774335)
for her performance as Mammy, an affable slave close to Scarlett O’Hara.

The nationwide protests of recent weeks have caused other entertainment
companies to reconsider how their content is viewed in the current
climate. The Paramount Network said on Tuesday that [it had removed
“Cops,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/business/media/cops-canceled-paramount-tv-show.html)
the long-running reality show that glorified police officers, from its
schedule before its 33rd season.

There have also been similar moves in Britain. On Monday, the BBC
removed episodes of the comedy series “Little Britain” — which featured
one character in blackface — from its streaming service.

“Times have changed since ‘Little Britain’ first aired so it is not
currently available on BBC iPlayer,” a BBC [spokesperson
said](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52983319). The show
had already been removed from Netflix and was also taken off the BritBox
streaming service.

“Little Britain,” which was shown in the early 2000s, was created by
David Walliams and Matt Lucas. Mr. Lucas, who was recently named the new
[host](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/11/matt-lucas-to-host-the-great-british-bake-off)
of “The Great British Baking Show,” has said in interviews that he would
not make “Little Britain” today.
