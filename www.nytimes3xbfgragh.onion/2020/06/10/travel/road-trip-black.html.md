The family road trip is making a comeback in the wake of the

*We want to hear about black travelers’ experiences of taking a road
trip around America. See the form at the end of the article.*

If there’s one thing the people behind car and R.V. companies, state
tourism boards, national and state parks and hotels agree on right now,
it’s that the summer of 2020 will be the summer of the road trip.

With the country reopening, travel industry experts say people are
planning short trips to destinations relatively close to home. By
driving they can control the number of people they interact with, how
many stops they make on the way and whether to take a detour or not —
all things they can’t control on a plane.

“I’ve always loved the freedom of the road trip,” one hotel owner said
in an email in April. “It feels familiar, nostalgic, and very American.
Now, more than ever, when we are allowed to travel again, we expect to
see families, friends, and couples jumping into their cars and hitting
the open road.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For many black travelers, however, the road trip has long conjured fear,
not freedom. Victor Hugo Green published the first version of his
now-famous “Green Book” in 1936; it listed towns, motels, restaurants
and homes where black drivers were welcome and would be safe. At the
time, state and local laws enforced racial segregation, primarily in the
South, a racial caste system known as Jim Crow that was legally undone
by the passage of Civil Rights legislation in the 1960s. The “Green
Book” was updated and published through the 1960s and inspired
[the 2018
film](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/23/arts/green-book-interracial-friendship.html)
of the same name that won an Oscar but was widely criticized for making
a white character’s emotional journey its focus.

And while white travelers might convince themselves that the dangers the
“Green Book” addressed have faded — places where there is a high
likelihood of being stopped by the police, being harassed by fellow
travelers, or where it could be fatal to be seen after sundown — for
many black travelers these dangers remain all too vivid.

Following the deaths of [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html)
and [Breonna
Taylor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/breonna-taylor-police.html)
at the hands of the police, and [Ahmaud
Arbery](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia.html)
at the hands of armed white residents, and coming on the heels of the
coronavirus and its heavy toll — both in terms of
[health](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F04%2F07%2Fus%2Fcoronavirus-race.html)
and
[employment](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F06%2F01%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fblack-workers-inequality-economic-risks.html)
— on African-Americans, some black travelers worry that they will face
even more discrimination on the road this summer.

“Travel is supposed to be a reprieve from all the hard things we are
usually dealing with, but it often doesn’t feel that way for us,” said
Damon Lawrence, co-founder of Homage Hospitality Group, a hotel company
that draws [inspiration for its
properties](http://www.stayhomage.com/themoor) from black history and
caters particularly to black travelers. “Having to constantly be on high
alert adds extra anxiety, and it’s always hard, but right now, it’s an
exhausting task to even leave the house, let alone go on a road trip.”

Mr. Lawrence, like many other African-Americans, said that he always
shares his location with friends and family on his phone, so that
someone can check in and know where he is.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“If something goes wrong, I need someone to know where I am or where
I’ve been,” he said.

## A lot of planning, and no detours

Nisha Parker, a special-education teacher in Bakersfield, Calif., loves
to drive and doesn’t want to allow fear about what could go wrong to
stop her. She also wants her two children to see America’s landscapes,
she said. So this summer her family will drive across the country from
their hometown to New York.

But Ms. Parker, 32, said that she can’t imagine just being able to pack
up and go without a plan, like some white families might be able to do.

So for the last six months, she has been meticulously planning their
journey. She knows which towns her family will stop in, which they’ll
drive straight through, and which they’ll avoid entirely. She also knows
which stretches of the road her children won’t be allowed to drink juice
or water on, to avoid bathroom breaks in towns where the family could
encounter racism or violence based on their race.

“We try not to stop in places that are desolate and we try to only stop
in cities for gas,” she said. “If we have to stop for gas in a rural
area, we use a debit card so we don’t have to go into the gas station
store. If we are going to stay somewhere overnight, we look at the
demographics to make sure we aren’t going to a place where we would be
the only black people or where we would be targeted, especially at
night.”

Ms. Parker grew up road tripping with family between New York and North
Carolina, and her parents took similar precautions. She and her husband
have also considered getting a dashboard camera, so that if they are
stopped by police and things turn deadly there is some record of it.

In a way, Facebook groups for black travelers and group chats have
become the 21st-century version of the “Green Book.” People talk about
where they’ve been and follow in each other's footsteps, sharing where
they were treated well and where they felt uncomfortable or unsafe. Many
stay in the same hotels, eat at the same restaurants or skip the same
towns.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We go where our friends and family have gone because we know that it’s
safe,” said Dianelle Rivers-Mitchell, founder of [Black Girls Travel
Too](https://www.blackgirlstraveltoo.com/), a group tour company for
black women. “During this moment, with the protests as a backdrop, and
as our community deals with how we were harder hit by coronavirus and we
risk facing even more discrimination based on that, I just don’t see
road-tripping being it for us.”

The so-called sundown towns — where black people were effectively banned
after dark and where those who stayed too late were attacked by white
mobs — no longer exist, but, for some black drivers, the fear of getting
lost or stuck in a town where being black could lead to violence is a
real concern that affects how a road trip is planned.

Monica Jackson, a medical biller for a hospital network in Texas said
that she loves to drive, but as a rule she will not go on a trip that
requires driving for more than six hours, so that she doesn’t have to
consider spending the night in a town where she could be targeted for
being black.

## Deadly police stops

Ms. Jackson, 42, said that she feels anxious when she passes through
areas — including Texas’s Williamson and Denton counties — where she’s
had unnerving interactions with white police officers.

“I always feel worried on the road in some counties because I’ve been
stopped for no reason,” she said. “I always pray and say, ‘OK, Lord
please protect me. I don’t want to end up in jail for no reason.’ It’s
always in the back of my mind that I could be the next Sandra Bland.”

Ms. Bland was a vocal civil rights activist [who was found
hanged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/07/us/sandra-bland-brian-encinia.html)
in a Texas jail cell in July 2015 after she was arrested during a
traffic stop.

Brian Oliver, founder of [BMore See More](https://bmoreseemore.org/), a
nonprofit that works with black male students and encourages them to
travel, said that he used to be worried about driving in the Deep South,
but videos of black men being killed by the police or targeted by white
Americans have shown him that racist violence can occur anywhere.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There used to be a sense of some places being less safe for black
people, but from seeing the news lately, I don’t think there’s any place
that’s guaranteed to be safe for us,” he said.

Mr. Oliver, 35, who also runs the blog “[Beyond
Bmore](https://beyondbmore.com/),” said that in 2013 he and three
friends — all black men — drove overnight from Atlanta to New Orleans
for Super Bowl XLVII, and for the duration of the drive, they veiled
their anxieties and fears in jokes about whether they would arrive
safely.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We were in the car laughing about not stopping in this place or that
place, but the sad truth is that we all knew that we really couldn’t
stop in some of those places,” Mr. Oliver said. “It’s crazy to try and
describe the kind of threat and fear you feel at the prospect of getting
lost, losing signal and not really knowing where you are.”

Mr. Lawrence of Homage Hospitality said that a desire to make black
travelers feel welcome and able to relax without worrying that someone
might [call the police on them simply for checking
in](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/08/us/airbnb-black-women-police.html)
was one of the main reasons he created his company.

## The right to be on the road

Too often, black travelers say, they are made to feel like they don’t
belong. That feeling was heightened recently by [the killing of Mr.
Arbery](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia.html)
while running in a Georgia suburb and by the false accusation that a
black [birdwatcher in New York’s Central
Park](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/nyregion/amy-cooper-christian-central-park-video.html)
was assaulting a white woman after he’d asked her to leash her dog.

And that feeling extends to the open road, so celebrated in American
literature and film, but where many black drivers said that when stopped
by the police, the first questions they’re met with are often “Where are
you going?” or “Why are you here?”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s as if they are saying why are you in this area?” Mr. Oliver said.
“I have every right to be here just as much as you have the right to
be on this road.”

Jeff Jenkins, a travel blogger who runs [Chubby
Diaries](https://www.chubbydiaries.com/), a travel company for plus-size
people, said that his anxiety about being targeted by the police ran so
deep that it affected his choice of car. The recent killings of black
men by the police have only added to his anxiety.

“I go for soccer-mom cars because they seem to be less intimidating to
the police,” he said. “A typical sedan or something that sort of just
says, ‘I’m safe and boring, don’t look at me.’”

Mr. Jenkins, 34, is planning on driving from Austin to visit several
national parks this summer, he said, adding that in recent weeks he has
become “an R.V. savant.”

“These opportunities, these parks, these roads are meant for me as
well,” Mr. Jenkins said. “They are not meant to just be shared with
one ethnicity. I have pride that this is my country, and I have every
right to bask in the wonders of America, like any white
American.”
