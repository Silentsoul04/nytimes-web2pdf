Having met lions only from a distance in zoos, I did not consider that
in the wild they can carry the scent of the dead prey they have recently
consumed, and thereby stink. Poems can give us new information. The idea
that something haunting and dangerous strolls through the camp at night,
though, feels like recent days --- tented up against the virus, we sleep
our fitful sleeps. Patricia Kirkpatrick's splendid new book, ``Blood
Moon,'' carries us away to so many places and helps us ``see farther''
indeed, even asking our most present questions. What comes next? Who
knows what? \emph{Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye}

\emph{for Melinda Ward}\\
\emph{By Patricia Kirkpatrick}

When the lion came through the camp,\\
one woman sat up in her tent, breathing\\
the terrible smell.

Next morning the guide said no\\
when she asked then \emph{yes but}\\
\emph{don't tell the others.}

Sleep in a tent, dream with creatures \ldots{}\\
The night breathes and stirs.

If you wait before using a lamp,\\
your eyes will adjust\\
and you can see farther in the dark.

How do you know? How do you\\
ever know?
