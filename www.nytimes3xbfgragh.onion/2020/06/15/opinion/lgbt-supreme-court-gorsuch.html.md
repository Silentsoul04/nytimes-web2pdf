The new season of my [favorite television
show](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/03/opinion/the-good-fight-trump.html),
“The Good Fight,” begins with the heroine, the feminist lawyer Diane
Lockhart, awakening in what seems at first like a giddy alternative
reality in which Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election. She remembers
the horrors of the last three and a half years, but no one else seems
to. A crushing weight lifts as she convinces herself it was all an awful
dream.

Then she is sent to a meeting with her firm’s new client, Harvey
Weinstein. There’s been no \#MeToo movement. Instead, corporate “lean
in” feminism is at its apogee. Diane realizes there have been gains
made since Donald Trump took office that are unbearable to give up.

Obviously, a world in which Clinton beat Trump would be better in a
million ways. Still, right now we have two big examples of how Trump’s
perverse presidency has inadvertently led to progress.

The sudden, rapid embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement by white
people is a function of the undeniable brutality of George Floyd’s
videotaped killing. But public opinion has also moved left on racial
issues [in
reaction](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020)
to an unpopular president who behaves like a cross between Bull Connor
and Andrew Dice Clay.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And the thrilling [6-3
decision](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/us/politics/gorsuch-supreme-court-gay-transgender-rights.html)
the Supreme Court just issued upholding L.G.B.T. equality wouldn’t be as
devastating to the religious right if it had happened under a President
Clinton.

Before Monday, you could legally be fired for being gay, bisexual or
transgender in 26 states. Now the court has ruled that gay and
transgender people are protected by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex. The
decision has extra cultural force because it was written by Justice Neil
Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, and joined by the conservative chief justice
John Roberts.

“The whole point of the Federalist Society judicial project, the whole
point of electing Trump to implement it, was to deliver Supreme Court
victories to social conservatives,” tweeted the [conservative writer
Varad
Mehta](https://twitter.com/varadmehta/status/1272532015292862464?s=20).
“If they can’t deliver anything that basic, there’s no point for
either. The damage is incalculable.”

The phrase “But Gorsuch” is shorthand for how conservatives justify all
the moral compromises they’ve made in supporting Trump; controlling the
Supreme Court makes it all worth it. So there’s a special sweetness in
Gorsuch spearheading the most important L.G.B.T. rights decision since
the 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which established a
constitutional right to same-sex marriage.

This isn’t simply Schadenfreude. The fact that this momentous ruling was
written by a right-wing judge sends a message that progress on L.G.B.T.
rights will be very hard to reverse.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Had Clinton, like Trump, been able to put two justices on the court, the
ultimate decision in this case would likely have been much the same,
perhaps with a different legal rationale. But social conservatives would
have been animated by outraged opposition, sure that winning the next
election was key to re-establishing power. Now they’re demoralized.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Trump administration will continue to try to roll back gay and
transgender rights. Just last Friday, it finalized a regulation saying
that the Affordable Care Act’s ban on sex discrimination in medical care
[doesn’t apply to trans
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/us/politics/trump-transgender-rights.html),
using an argument similar to the one the Supreme Court rejected on
Monday. Trump judges on lower courts can be expected to rule in favor of
religious conservatives.

But these will be rear-guard actions. “The Roe v. Wade of religious
liberty is here, and it was delivered by golden boy Neil Gorsuch,”
[lamented conservative
lawyer](https://twitter.com/josh_hammer/status/1272532875204853761?s=20)
Josh Hammer.

Legal experts who watched the arguments unfold weren’t entirely shocked
that Gorsuch ruled as he did. The justice is well known as a textualist,
someone who holds that the meaning of a law turns on the text alone, not
the intentions of its drafters.

“What I saw in the argument was Gorsuch really struggling with the fact
that the textual argument seemed really powerful to him,” Samuel
Bagenstos, a University of Michigan law professor, told me. “There’s no
way to think about sexual orientation discrimination without sex being
part of it.”

Bagenstos was more surprised that Roberts — who, after all, wrote a
dissent in Obergefell — joined the majority. Roberts may have simply
been persuaded by the merits of the case, but Bagenstos suspects he was
responsive to the political climate as well.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This is going to be a very popular decision,” Bagenstos said. “It is
something that the American people will largely agree with. And you
never go wrong predicting that the Supreme Court is going to follow the
election returns.”

None of this means that progressives can rest easy about this court.
We’re awaiting important decisions on DACA, which could put hundreds
of thousands of Dreamers in danger of deportation, and on [June Medical
Services v.
Russo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/us/supreme-court-abortion-louisiana.html),
which could end up eliminating abortion access in many states.

But on Monday, Gorsuch delivered a blow to the religious right that a
court full of Clinton appointees could never have managed. Even the
darkest timeline has its consolations.
