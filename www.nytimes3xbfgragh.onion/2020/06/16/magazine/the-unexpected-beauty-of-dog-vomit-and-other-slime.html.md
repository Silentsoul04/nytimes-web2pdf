They say everybody needs a hobby, and for the past six months, mine has
been taking videos and photographs of slime molds in the oak and redwood
forests near my home in California. Perhaps we’ve met somewhere on the
trail? I was the guy on the ground with a lens clipped to his iPhone,
the patient wife, the children asking worriedly from a distance whether
a plant was poison oak. Perhaps you may have recognized my
“slime-molding outfit”: the frayed Y2K jacket and Old Navy cargo pants
caked with mud of many vintages. Perhaps, if you dared ask what I was
doing, I popped up and (in those days when strangers stood close to one
another) showed you my pictures.

I must have heard of slime molds at some point before the rabbit hole
opened violently beneath me last December. For a tiny organism that
doesn’t kill people, it hits the news with some regularity. Since making
[national
headlines](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1973/05/31/99147556.html?pageNumber=82)
almost 50 years ago as a “mysterious, encompassing ooze” in a Texas
backyard, slime molds have recurrently earned their 15 minutes for such
improbable feats as recreating a [map of the Tokyo subway
system](https://www.livescience.com/8035-slime-mold-beats-humans-perfecting-traffic-networks.html)
and modeling the distribution of [dark matter in the
universe.](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/slime-mold-simulations-used-to-map-dark-matter-holding-universe-together)

What sent me into the woods that month was not the creeping blobs of
horror movies but rather a photo of iridescent purple Lamproderma posted
to the citizen-science project iNaturalist. It was unlike anything I’d
seen: Imagine ranks of glass-head pins in the belly of a leaf, and now
imagine that those pinheads were made of frosted amethyst. This, I would
learn, was the sporangial form of a slime mold. The pulsating blobs of
Texas-backyard mystery are plasmodia — multinucleate masses that course
the forest until conditions are just right for them to form the colorful
fruiting bodies full of spores.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

My fascination — immediate, convulsive — came not only from the beauty
but also from my realization that such beauty had surrounded me during
decades of wandering these woods, without my ever having noticed it. In
my defense, slime molds make no appearance in my parents’ old Audubon
guides, and the sole image in my mille-feuille college biology textbook
is a blurry yellow smear. The only literary slime molds I know of are
meditations in the notebooks of Octavia Butler and a telepathic
invention of Philip K.
Dick.

Still, enough excuses: *I’d walked right past them.* Past the bursts of
carnival-candy slime mold, the salmon pearls of wolf’s milk, the tussled
sheaves of chocolate tube slimes. My new awareness was nothing less than
transportive. I was a sudden convert, an acolyte of leaf duff and
rotting logs. Children were dispatched in tense reconnaissance — being
of keen eyesight and closer to the ground, they make fine scouts. Part
of the joy, we learned, was returning to a spot to track a discovery,
such as a dog-vomit slime mold we encountered wandering in the redwoods,
a dead ringer for a brand-new kitchen sponge. A *crawling* sponge, for
we returned a few days later to find that it had journeyed on.

At times, we have followed a slime mold’s movements as one might a
favorite team. Early in our adventures, my youngest son spotted a swath
of gold so bright I thought it might be an abandoned signpost; closer
inspection revealed a Badhamia plasmodium marching down a rotting log
(like most slime molds, Badhamia, by virtue of obscurity, has no common
name). Racing back the next day, we found that, having reached the south
pole of the log, it had reversed course and was moving northward at such
velocity that we could see it moving with the time-lapse function on my
iPhone. The following week it began its apotheosis. The gold was gone;
now bunches of grapelike sporangia glittered. A week later, they began
to rupture, spilling twilight-colored spores. Two weeks later, only
hollowed orbs remained, crystalline and breath-shivered. By then I had
discovered a group of people posting their discoveries on Instagram with
the hashtag \#slimemoldsunday: intergalactic gem collections from the
forests of

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

This was early March. As with any love, the seeds of loss were also
planted. These are the very forests that have been burning with
increasing violence each year; when the woods go, these worlds go with
them. Then: Covid-19 and the progressive closing of the parks. And then:
3,000 miles away, in another woods, [Christian Cooper walked into the
Ramble to look for
birds.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/14/nyregion/central-park-amy-cooper-christian-racism.html)

Before the shelter-in-place, my favorite spot was a rotting log at the
intersection of a pair of trails used heavily by runners who barely
registered me in the trailside gully with my cellphone. The past weeks
have made increasingly clear that not everyone is granted such peaceful
indifference. As Melody Cooper wrote movingly about her brother in an
[Op-Ed for The New York
Times,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/opinion/chris-cooper-central-park.html)
even sneaking through the trees “to catch a glimpse of a beautiful
warbler” carries a risk for a nature lover who is black.

It has been heartening, during these painful days, to see the
environmental movement stand behind Black Lives Matter and other
movements for social reform, to further recognize that environmentalism
and racial justice can’t be unlinked. My hope is that this new awakening
will be durable, matched by a greater equality in open spaces — a
freedom to rustle through the leaf-litter and peer into the damp of
fallen logs.
