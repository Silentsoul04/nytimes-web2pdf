In a series of exquisitely blunt, elegiac poems for his mother, Carl
Adamshick returns from her dying days to a changed world: ``new
calendar'' --- everything has altered forever. (Many poems in his recent
collection, ``Birches,'' are called ``Black Snow.'') There is, for a
long time after, the shock of the new reality and the difficulty
applying the fact of the change to each moment that comes next. Have we
ever seen a better image than these tweezers? This brave book stares
straight into grief's paralysis and the continual climbing out ---
simply to do whatever small things follow. \emph{Selected by Naomi
Shihab Nye}

\emph{By Carl Adamshick}

From my mother's funeral\\
I brought back Illinois

I brought back a ring and a necklace\\
I brought black snow

I brought a sense of cruelty\\
and rage that felt fair\\
to inflict on each moment

I brought back a new calendar\\
where the days\\
were ten times longer

and had to be opened\\
using tweezers on a dial\\
with a six-digit combination
