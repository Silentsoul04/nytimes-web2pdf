State and local health officials have found themselves at the center of
regular news briefings amid the coronavirus outbreak, making them
targets for harassment and threats.

Leaders of local and state health departments have been subject to
harassment, personal insults and death threats in recent weeks, a
response from a vocal and angry minority of the public who say that mask
requirements and restrictions on businesses have gone too far.

One top health official, Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the director of the Los
Angeles County Department of Public Health, issued a statement on Monday
condemning attacks on public health directors and disclosing that she
faced repeated threats to her safety.

``The death threats started last month, during a Covid-19 Facebook Live
public briefing when someone very casually suggested that I should be
shot,'' Dr. Ferrer said in a statement. ``I didn't immediately see the
message, but my husband did, my children did, and so did my
colleagues.''

``It is deeply worrisome,'' she added, ``to imagine that our hardworking
infectious disease physicians, nurses, epidemiologists and environmental
health specialists or any of our other team members would have to face
this level of hatred.''

Across the country, many public health officials
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/14/us/coronavirus-health-departments.html}{entered
the coronavirus pandemic with bare-bones staffs and strained budgets},
leaving them ill-prepared to handle a mounting crisis. Before the
pandemic, they had focused on illness prevention, contact tracing for
communicable diseases, vaccinations and campaigns against smoking and
vaping.

Now some of them, suddenly facing the public with regular television
briefings about efforts to fight the coronavirus, are choosing to leave
their positions entirely.

Lori Tremmel Freeman, the chief executive of the National Association of
County and City Health Officials, said last week that dozens of top
health officials have resigned or been fired since the pandemic began.
At least four state health directors have resigned from their posts; Dr.
Amy Acton, the state health director of Ohio,
\href{https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200611/dr-amy-acton-resigns-as-state-health-director-democrats-cite-criticism-from-gop-lawmakers}{stepped
down} this month after enduring anti-Semitic attacks and demonstrations
by armed protesters on her front lawn.

Dr. Umair A. Shah, the executive director of the public health
department in Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, described a
tense new role. ``Now that we're quite visible and we're part of very
difficult decision-making, naturally those decisions are having an
incredible impact on community members in a very specific way,'' Dr.
Shah said. ``That's where the problem comes in.''

Not all of the officials have said why they are leaving, and some have
cited personal reasons or planned retirements, but Ms. Freeman said she
had heard many accounts of harassment.

``There's a big red target on their backs,'' Ms. Freeman said. ``They're
becoming villainized for their guidance. In normal times, they're very
trusted members of their community.''

Some critics of the public health directors have said that they believe
that allowing businesses to operate is worth the risk of spreading the
coronavirus, and that health directors are too cautious about
reopenings. Others have cited conspiracy theories that claim that the
coronavirus is a hoax; that the development of a vaccine is part of a
massive effort to track citizens and monitor their movements; and that
wearing a mask or cloth face covering is a practice that impedes
personal freedom.

In Washington State, where rural counties are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html}{struggling
with new outbreaks} and trying to warn residents to take basic
precautions to stem the spread of the virus, pleas from local health
officials have often been answered with hostility and threats.

In Yakima County, which has more than six times as many cases per capita
as the county that includes Seattle, hospitals have reached capacity and
patients were being taken elsewhere for medical care. Gov. Jay Inslee
warned over the weekend that ``we are frankly at the breaking point,''
and has said he would require Yakima residents to wear face coverings in
an effort to slow the virus's spread.

    University of Leicester.

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    weeks to months after initial exposure.~People infected with the

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the
    coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be
    possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make
    people sicker the second time.

``I've been called a Nazi numerous times,'' said Andre Fresco, the
executive director of the Yakima Health District. ``I've been told not
to show up at certain businesses. I've been called a Communist and
Gestapo. I've been cursed at and generally treated in a very
unprofessional way. It's very difficult.''

In California, angry protesters have tracked down addresses of public
health officers and gathered outside their homes, chanting and holding
signs. Last week, a group called the Freedom Angels did just that in
Contra Costa County, Calif., filming themselves and posting the videos
on Facebook.

``We came today to protest in front of our county public health
officer's house, and some people might have issues with that, that we
took it to their house,'' one woman said in a video. ``But I have to
tell you guys, they're coming to our houses. Their agenda is contact
tracing, testing, mandatory masks and ultimately an injection that has
not been tested,'' she said, apparently referring to a vaccine even
though none have been approved.

Dr. Nichole Quick, the chief health officer for Orange County, Calif.,
resigned as protests and harassment intensified after
\href{https://www.ocregister.com/2020/06/08/o-c-chief-health-officer-dr-nichole-quick-resigns-amid-mask-controversy-threats/}{an
order to require face masks in certain businesses}, including grocery
stores and pharmacies. Emily Brown, director of the Rio Grande County
Public Health Department in rural Colorado, was
\href{https://www.npr.org/2020/06/14/876714176/public-health-workers-face-threats-unemployment-while-fighting-virus}{fired
when she encountered community resistance} to the stricter rules she had
encouraged.

The departures across the country have prompted industry officials to
ask whether a dearth of leadership is ahead for health departments, even
as they combat the pandemic.

``We've never seen this level of vitriol before,'' said Kat DeBurgh, the
executive director of the Health Officers Association of California.
``I'm worried not just about the present but about the future. When
they're subject to such harassment, who is going to step into these
jobs?''
