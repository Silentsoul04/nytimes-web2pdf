Facebook put on an upbeat presentation to advertisers on Tuesday, the
same day the clothing chain Eddie Bauer, the film distributor Magnolia
Pictures and the Ben & Jerry’s ice cream brand announced that they would
stop advertising on the platform through July.

Those companies joined Patagonia, the North Face, REI and others in a
growing [boycott that has targeted Facebook’s content moderation
practices](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/technology/facebook-ad-boycott-civil-rights.html).

In a short video, part of a weeklong showcase for digital companies
hoping to attract advertising dollars, Facebook displayed posts that
companies like Delta Air Lines and Calvin Klein ran during the
coronavirus pandemic. The prerecorded presentation did not specifically
address the boycott.

While several large companies have pulled away from Facebook, smaller
businesses that make up the bulk of its eight million advertisers have
been considering their options.

Jason Dille, who oversees media planning for 20 clients at the ad agency
Chemistry, said many of them had considered putting a halt to buying ads
on Facebook but that the pandemic had complicated their plans.

“Some of my clients are just starting to come back,” Mr. Dille said. “If
they don’t create sales and get business to turn around, they’re going
to go under.”

He added: “Facebook is a double-edged sword. You don’t want to support
it, but you have to use it in order to reach a large audience.”

The backlash intensified late last month, as [a flurry of
misinformation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/technology/antifa-local-disinformation.html)
appeared on Facebook amid worldwide protests against racism and police
brutality. The company [declined to take
action](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/technology/twitter-facebook-zuckerberg-trump.html)
against posts from President Trump — the same ones that Twitter flagged
as misleading or glorifying violence.

In recent days, Facebook [removed
ads](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/us/politics/facebook-trump-ads-antifa-red-triangle.html)
from Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign that featured a red triangular
symbol used by the Nazis during World War II. The company also announced
that it would gradually allow users to opt out of [seeing political
ads](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/technology/opt-out-political-ads-facebook.html).
On Sunday, it acknowledged [in a blog
post](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/business/news/where-facebook-stands-racial-equality-justice)
that its enforcement of content rules “isn’t perfect.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Facebook sidestepped sensitive issues during its presentation at the
so-called NewFronts, an annual event for digital media companies to
promote themselves as advertising venues. Before the Facebook section on
Tuesday, Snap pledged to shield advertisers from harmful content, and
Condé Nast said it had been forced to “hold a mirror up to ourselves”
after [an internal
uproar](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/13/business/media/conde-nast-racial.html)
over how the company has dealt with race. Immediately after Facebook’s
presentation, the Ad Council, a nonprofit group, presented [a
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8_598SQAts) about the Black
Lives Matter movement.

In explaining why it would stop advertising on Facebook, [Magnolia
Pictures](https://twitter.com/MagnoliaPics/status/1275420847151300615?s=20)
said on Tuesday that it was “seeking meaningful change at Facebook and
the end to their amplification of hate speech.”

Ben & Jerry’s [pushed
Facebook](https://www.benjerry.com/about-us/media-center/stop-hate-for-profit)
on Tuesday “to take stronger action to stop its platforms from being
used to divide our nation, suppress voters, foment and fan the flames of
racism and violence, and undermine our democracy.”

The freelancing platform
[Upwork](https://twitter.com/Upwork/status/1274110997695873024?s=20) and
the password manager
[Dashlane](https://blog.dashlane.com/make-facebook-stop-hate/) are also
participating in the boycott, which advocacy groups such as the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the
Anti-Defamation League have promoted with the hashtag
\#StopHateForProfit.

The effort, which began taking shape [this
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/business/media/facebook-advertisers-trump-zuckerberg.html),
gained traction Friday and through the weekend as several [outdoor-gear
retailers](https://twitter.com/Arcteryx/status/1275482126599639040?s=20),
including [REI](https://twitter.com/REI/status/1274110350703554560?s=20)
and
[Patagonia](https://twitter.com/patagonia/status/1274832569398292480),
joined in.

[The North
Face](https://twitter.com/thenorthface/status/1273985578564870145?s=20)
has stopped posting content and buying ads on Facebook through July, but
will continue putting free posts on Instagram, which Facebook owns, the
company’s global vice president of marketing, Steve Lesnard, said in an
interview. The North Face spends more on Facebook than it does on any
other platform besides Google, Mr. Lesnard said.

“The stakes are too high,” he said. “The platform needs to evolve.”

The efforts against Facebook have gotten support from ad agencies. In an
email to more than 50 clients last week, the digital ad agency 360i said
it supported the boycott, [The Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ad-agency-encourages-clients-to-join-facebook-ad-boycott-11592517885?mod=tech_lead_pos2)
reported. Some companies have quietly joined the effort, and several ad
agencies have developed guidelines for major companies interested in
participating, said three people with knowledge of recent discussions,
who requested anonymity because the talks are confidential.

“It feels like we’ve come to an inflection point,” said Stephan Loerke,
the chief executive of the World Federation of Advertisers, a trade
group. “There’s a growing awareness that this isn’t a brand safety issue
anymore — it’s a societal safety issue.”

Facebook executives have tried to limit the damage. In an email sent to
some of its largest advertising clients last week, obtained by The New
York Times, the company said it had taken steps to mitigate the effects
of potentially harmful speech on the site.

“There are competing pressures every day when managing a platform,” the
memo said. “Our focus is to act on what is most important: removing hate
speech and content that harms communities while using our platform for
efforts like providing authoritative voting information and registering
people to vote.”

Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president for global marketing
solutions, said in a statement that the company was in discussions with
advertisers and civil rights groups “about how, together, we can be a
force for good.”

“We deeply respect any brand’s decision, and remain focused on the
important work of removing hate speech and providing critical voting
information,” she said in the statement.

Most companies that have turned away from Facebook are not shutting down
their Facebook accounts. They expect to return to buying ads on the
platform after July.

“It almost feels a little hypocritical to me,” said Barry Lowenthal, the
chief executive of the Media Kitchen agency. “How do you justify going
back?”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He suggested that companies make a gradual separation from Facebook as
they experiment with alternatives like Amazon, Snap or TikTok.

“They’re not doing a good job, and advertisers want better protections,”
Mr. Lowenthal said of Facebook.

Facebook generates nearly all its revenue from advertisements. The
research firm eMarketer expects that the platform’s ad revenue will
increase nearly 5 percent this year.

Around the same time of Facebook’s presentation on Tuesday,
representatives of some of the biggest companies that regularly
advertise on the platform gathered online for a previously scheduled
meeting to discuss its handling of misinformation and hate speech.
