As the coronavirus pandemic hits more impoverished countries with
fragile health care systems, global health authorities are scrambling
for supplies of a simple treatment that saves lives: oxygen.

Many patients severely ill with Covid-19, the illness caused by the
coronavirus, require help with breathing at some point. But now the
epidemic is spreading rapidly in South Asia, Latin America and parts of
Africa, regions of the world where many hospitals are poorly equipped
and lack the ventilators, tanks and other equipment necessary to save
patients whose lungs are failing.

The World Health Organization is hoping to raise $250 million to
increase oxygen delivery to those regions. The World Bank and the
African Union are contributing to the effort, and some medical charities
are seeking donations for the cause.

The W.H.O. estimated on Wednesday that with about one million new
coronavirus cases worldwide per week, the world will need 620,000 cubic
meters of oxygen per day, or 88,000 large cylinders.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By a stroke of luck, the W.H.O., UNICEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation in 2017 began searching for ways to increase oxygen delivery
in poor and middle-income countries — not in anticipation of a pandemic,
but because oxygen can save the lives of premature infants and children
with pneumonia.

The organizations began ordering equipment in January, but within weeks
suppliers were swamped by the sudden surge in demand created by the
pandemic.

The W.H.O. has purchased 14,000 oxygen concentrators, which filter
oxygen from the air, to be sent to 120 countries, and the agency hopes
to buy 170,000 more concentrators over the next six months at a cost of
$100 million.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the W.H.O.,
warned that “80 percent of the market is owned by just a few companies,
and demand is outstripping supply.”

Although the machinery needed to generate oxygen is relatively simple,
it must be sturdy enough to withstand the dust, humidity and other
hazards common in rural hospitals in poor countries. Some companies
produce relatively rugged equipment, but prices are rising and
restrictions on international flights are complicating deliveries.

“So, unfortunately, there were 26 deaths, 70 percent of them in less
than 24 hours,” Dr. Barka said. “I can’t say they were all from a lack
of oxygen, but it played a role.”

Alima needs 40 oxygen concentrators, but the agency has just eight, he
said. Because it is hard to move patients from one hospital to another,
some die waiting, gasping for air.

In Congo, many Covid-19 patients arrive at hospitals with critically low
blood oxygen levels — sometimes as low as 60 percent, a level at which
patients must normally be put on a ventilator to survive. (Normal oxygen
saturation levels are 95 percent or more.)

One such patient was a doctor who had for a while refused to go to the
hospital and instead stayed home, taking chloroquine, which is still in
Congo’s national treatment guidelines.

“Then, when his condition deteriorated and he did come, just as he was
nearing the Covid building, he developed convulsions,” Dr. Barka
recalled. “They stopped to give him a drug for them, and he died just at
the gate.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nigeria is also grappling with an oxygen shortage, said Dr. Sanjana
Bhardwaj, UNICEF’s chief of health there. Since May, hospitals in Lagos
and Kano have seen a steady stream of older patients with Covid-19
symptoms who need oxygen.

In nearly every country the virus has hit, rich or poor, about 15
percent of all symptomatic patients develop pneumonia severe enough to
require extra oxygen, the W.H.O. estimates, but not so dire that they
must be put on a ventilator.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Ventilators are rare in poor countries; they can cost up to $50,000, and
patients must be heavily sedated the whole time the breathing tube is
lodged deep in their airways; also, the pressure must be constantly
monitored to prevent lung damage. That requires anesthesiologists and
trained respiratory technicians, positions that many hospitals
lack.

Oxygen can be delivered in two ways. Tanks contain nearly pure oxygen.
For patients who need large volumes and help keeping the air sacs in
their lungs open, tanks can deliver oxygen at high pressure through a
mask strapped tightly over the nose and mouth.

But tanks are heavy, must be refilled at central stations and delivered
by truck, and they pose some risk of explosion and fire. While many poor
countries have plants making industrial-grade oxygen for construction
jobs like welding, it cannot be used on patients because the tanks often
contain rust or oily water that could lodge in the lungs, said Paul
Molinaro, chief of operations support and logistics at the W.H.O.

An alternative is an [oxygen
concentrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_concentrator), which
is usually the size of a suitcase or even a briefcase. Concentrators
pull oxygen out of ambient air by forcing it under pressure through a
“molecular sieve” filled with the mineral zeolite, which adsorbs
nitrogen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most concentrators cost only $1,000 to $2,000. They need electricity but
can run on a generator or batteries, using about as much power as a
small refrigerator.

Typically concentrators can produce about 90 percent pure oxygen. They
do not deliver it under pressure, but the thin tube through which the
oxygen streams can be connected to a continuous positive airway pressure
machine, or CPAP, to enrich the air it blows into the lungs.

Alima has started a campaign, “Oxygen for Africa,” to raise money to
send about 500 concentrators to six poor countries, Jennifer Lazuta, a
spokeswoman, said.

UNICEF [has ordered about 16,000
concentrators](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/oxygen-therapy) for
about 90 countries, but thus far has been able to deliver only about
700, said Jonathan Howard-Brand, an innovation specialist at UNICEF’s
procurement center in
Copenhagen.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune

        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the

        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may

virus.

The W.H.O. has ordered another 14,000, of which 2,000 have been
delivered and 2,000 are in transit, Mr. Molinaro
said.

He and Mr. Howard-Brand described severe delivery problems created by
the epidemic, including delays of up to five weeks. When possible, the
aid agencies ship through the World Food Program, which [has dozens of
planes](https://www.wfp.org/publications/wfp-aviation-2018). But the
concentrators must compete for space with shipments of food, personal
protective gear and other lifesaving goods.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Also, some countries are far from cargo hub cities, while others
restrict all flights, even those containing aid, for fear of the virus
being introduced.

“We need more planes in the air,” Mr. Howard-Brand said.

UNICEF is also buying tens of thousands of pulse oximeters, fingertip
devices to measure blood-oxygen saturation.

In deciding how much equipment to buy, the aid agencies are, to some
extent, flying blind. As New York State learned when it was desperately
collecting ventilators in March, how great the need will be is
unpredictable.

Younger Covid-19 patients and those without other health problems often
survive without supplemental oxygen. Populations in Africa skew younger,
because vaccination and anti-malaria campaigns over the past two decades
have saved many children who otherwise would have died. Wide swaths of
older Africans died of AIDS before H.I.V. therapy became widely
available in the mid-2000s.

(It is [still unclear whether being on H.I.V.
treatment](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/staying-in-hiv-care/other-related-health-issues/coronavirus-covid-19)
increases risks of death from Covid-19, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. But U.N.AIDS, the U.N. program fighting
the disease, [worries that lockdowns and border closings will disrupt
supplies](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/un-warns-risk-low-distribution-aids-drug-amid-covid-lockdowns)
of H.I.V. medicines, which would undoubtedly put H.I.V. patients at high
risk.)

The agencies seek advice from other aid personnel in each country to
estimate how much equipment is needed, Mr. Molinaro said. If he had more
money and time, he added, he would concentrate on ways to increase
supplies of tanked oxygen, which is dangerous to ship and so must be
produced on site.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

In recent years, some public-private partnerships have sprung up to do
that. In East Africa, for example, an aid organization, [Assist
International](https://assistinternational.org/global-health/access-to-oxygen/),
set out several years ago to break local corporate monopolies producing
medical oxygen that many public hospitals in Africa could not afford.

With equipment supplied by the GE Foundation and money from Grand
Challenges Canada and other donors, Assist now has a network of
oxygen-making plants in Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia.

The U.N.’s oxygen-concentrator procurement effort, begun in April, was a
natural extension of the U.N.’s Oxygen Therapy Project, which began in
2017 with Gates Foundation support in an effort to save babies and
children.

By January, the project had found four manufacturers — two in China and
two in the United States — whose machines could stand up to harsh
conditions and which could add voltage stabilizers to prevent damage
from power spikes, which are common in the electrical systems of poor
countries and anywhere that relies on generators for power.

The agencies were just beginning to place orders when the pandemic
began.

“Our timing was immaculate,” said Mr. Howard-Brand, who helped write the
specifications for the new machines. “Now maybe the market will open
up.”
