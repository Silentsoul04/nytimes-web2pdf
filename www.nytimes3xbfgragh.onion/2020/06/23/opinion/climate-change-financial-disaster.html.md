The coronavirus crisis has forced the federal government to step up
suddenly with fiscal stimulus to sustain the U.S. economy and help avoid
a global depression. This necessary intervention comes at a price — a
spike in federal debt that will need to be repaid over the long term.
The resulting pressure on the government, U.S. taxpayers and the broader
economy will intersect with another major fiscal challenge, one that we
have yet to reckon with: [climate
change](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html).

Even before the coronavirus pandemic struck, the federal government’s
spending on climate-related disaster recovery was a rapidly rising
fiscal threat. In response to climate-related disasters in 2017, for
example, Congress [appropriated $136
billion](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R45084.pdf) in additional
funding for recovery — amounting to about $1,000 for every American
taxpayer.

The government faces wide exposure, including repairing damage to
federal property and lands, federal insurance for property and crops,
the cost of making public infrastructure resilient to
[climate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html)
impacts, and disaster aid (including
[relocation](https://www.npr.org/2017/01/10/509176361/alaskan-village-citing-climate-change-seeks-disaster-relief-in-order-to-relocate#:~:text=Alaska%20Climate%20Change%3A%20Village%20Makes%20Historic%20Request%20To%20Be%20Declared,needs%20to%20move%20the%20community.

of entire populations in harm’s way of persistent climate repercussions
like sea level
rise).

Fourteen[billion-dollar](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2010-2019-landmark-decade-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate)
weather and climate calamities struck last year, the fifth year in a row
with 10 or more. And projections don’t look good.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
[estimates](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/) that the average annual
number of disasters causing over $1 billion in damages over the past
five years was double the average over the past four decades. The agency
warned last year, “The number and cost of disasters are increasing over
time due to a combination of increased exposure, vulnerability, and the
fact that climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of
extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters.”

Overall, according to the government’s [national climate
assessment](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/) in 2018, continued
warming “is expected to cause substantial net damage to the U.S. economy
throughout this century, especially in the absence of increased
adaptation efforts.”

BlackRock, the global investment management firm, calculates a [275
percent
increase](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/whitepaper/bii-physical-climate-risks-april-2019.pdf)
in major hurricane risk by 2050 under a “no climate action” scenario
that assumes the continued use of fossil fuels. In California,
devastating wildfires forced the utility PG\&E to declare bankruptcy
last year when its insurance policy of $1.4 billion [paled in
comparison](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2018/11/15/californias-electric-giant-faces-possible-30-billion-in-damages-for-fires-that-have-killed-more-than-100/#5079293238c2)
with damages of $30 billion.

The federal government will bear an increasing share of these losses as
private insurance declines to provide coverage for
[flood](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/06/29/climate/hidden-flood-risk-maps.html)-
and
[wildfire-prone](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-one-can-agree-on-how-to-price-california-home-insurance-for-wildfires-11568649298)
property. U.S. coastal real estate properties have been likened to [junk
bonds](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fopinion%2Farticles%2F2018-05-03%2Fflood-risk-makes-coastal-real-estate-look-like-a-junk-bond%3Fsref%3D8nb4B7zL&data=02%7C01%7Cnsteel%40rmi.org%7Cadec35ab733049a0b57008d816fd9823%7C8ed8a585d8e64b00b9ccd370783559f6%7C1%7C0%7C637284625728410773&sdata=mCgVuOl8Z2sg76JVje%2B100Q5ANUcp2gtGuEpCqupcok%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-05-03/flood-risk-makes-coastal-real-estate-look-like-a-junk-bond?sref=8nb4B7zL.

— “something that will probably go up in value, but has a small to
moderate chance of going to zero,” as the Bloomberg opinion columnist
Noah Smith put it. It’s unsurprising that private insurers have not
filled the gap left by
[declining](http://www.ouazad.com/resources/paper_kahn_ouazad.pdf)
federal flood insurance.

Additionally, the ability of state and local governments to absorb
disaster costs is limited because they cannot borrow as the federal
government can. The only recourse for states overburdened with disaster
costs is to turn to the federal government. And the pandemic has
[underscored the
shortcomings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/climate/fema-volunteer-disaster-response.html)
in the federal government’s capacity to respond to multiple disasters.

Furthermore, banks are [actively offloading risky
mortgages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/27/climate/mortgage-climate-risk.html?campaignId=7JFJX)
onto the government-backed mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
As defaults rise with worsening climate, so will the direct liability of
the federal government. The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s
National Flood Insurance Program is about [$20.5 billion in
debt](https://www.insurancejournal.com/blogs/right-street/2018/09/13/500996.htm)
— meaning the government has so far chosen to absorb losses while also
increasing premiums. As the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco put
it, because of low “risk awareness and insurance affordability,” many
government agencies “have found themselves being expected to act as
[insurers
of](https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/publications/community-development-investment-review/2019/october/insurance-innovation-and-community-based-adaptation-finance/#_ftn2)[*first*](https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/publications/community-development-investment-review/2019/october/insurance-innovation-and-community-based-adaptation-finance/#_ftn2)[resort](https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/publications/community-development-investment-review/2019/october/insurance-innovation-and-community-based-adaptation-finance/#_ftn2).”

A substantial increase in disaster spending could threaten the factor
that has pushed the ballooning federal debt in the first place: the U.S.
government’s low cost of borrowing. U.S. Treasury notes are considered a
safe haven for investors, but there are signs this may be changing.
While the credit rating agencies [Fitch and S &
P](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-ratings-sp/sp-affirms-us-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-says-debt-and-deficit-will-worsen-idUSFWN2BQ1CV)
maintained their U.S. ratings at the beginning of the coronavirus
outbreak, [Fitch
noted](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-affirms-united-states-at-aaa-outlook-stable-26-03-2020)
that the short-term risk of downgrades increased in light of the
economic shock. At the same time, debt projections continue to increase:
The federal deficit, which exceeded [$1 trillion
in 2019](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/13/business/budget-deficit-1-trillion-trump.html),
is expected to reach [$4
trillion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/04/18/record-government-corporate-debt-risk-tipping-point-after-pandemic-passes/)
this year.

To fund climate disaster expenses of the magnitude described above, the
federal government would have to significantly escalate its borrowing.
Rating agencies are increasingly focused on climate-specific fiscal
pressures. As BlackRock stated, Moody’s “warned that climate change
would have a growing negative impact on the creditworthiness of U.S.
state and local insurers.” A 2018
[study](http://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/26007/Climate_Change_Costs.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
by the United Nations Environment Program found that “countries with
higher degrees of climate vulnerability face higher sovereign borrowing
costs.”

What can the government do to reduce its exposure to climate-related
disasters? Cut greenhouse gas emissions and ramp up spending to reduce
property exposure to climate-fueled storms and droughts.

We have a choice between a carbon tax and a spiraling climate disaster
tax. In a fast-approaching future where higher public spending and
escalating debt will require higher levels of taxation, a carbon tax is
a prudent choice. It can provide an important source of revenue,
encourage industries to decarbonize and lower the danger of further
credit rating downgrades — all while decreasing future disaster risk by
reducing emissions.

While doing this now [will not appreciably
affect](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/HeatBucket/heatbucket4.php)
climate disasters for some time, there is no doubt that ambitious action
to reduce emissions worldwide under American leadership can reduce the
long-term financial exposure of today’s young Americans. It will leave
the country better prepared to pay for other crises that arise — like
the one we are currently facing with Covid-19.
