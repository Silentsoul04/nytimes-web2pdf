# N.F.L. Trims Early Preseason Game and Prepares for Training Camps

Team owners canceled the annual Hall of Fame Game, but held firm on
opening training camps in July and the regular season in September.

The N.F.L. on Thursday canceled its annual Hall of Fame Game, an
exhibition scheduled for Aug. 6, so players and coaches grappling with
restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic could have more time to
prepare for the regular season, which, for now, is still set to begin
Sept. 10.

The decision, by team owners in an ad hoc teleconference, gave the
league flexibility to push back, if needed, the start of training camps.
Starting in late July, teams are expected to begin welcoming players to
their facilities.

The league and the players’ union are also discussing other measures,
including further [trimming the preseason
schedule](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/sports/football/nfl-preseason-schedule.html),
which consists of four games per team.

Still, Roger Goodell, the league commissioner, said the N.F.L. was
committed to starting the regular season on time and, if allowed by
state and local officials, having fans in the seats at games.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The most immediate hurdle, though, is preparing for training camps.
While the [league has established safety
protocols](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/sports/football/coronavirus-nfl-union.html)
that have allowed front office members and coaches to return to their
offices, the N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association have not agreed
on a set of guidelines, including testing and quarantines, to govern the
return of players. “Obviously, there’s a lot more to do,” Goodell said.

Allen Sills, the league’s chief medical officer, said in a conference
call with reporters after the meeting that the N.F.L. was in “very
active discussions” with the players’ union on screening, travel and a
“very ambitious” testing program, though “testing alone is not going
to be sufficient to keep everyone healthy.”

“This is all about risk reduction,” he added. “We know we can’t
eliminate risk.”

Unlike other professional leagues whose seasons were interrupted by the
pandemic in March, the N.F.L. has been able to conduct most of its
normal off-season activities, including free agency, the draft and
off-season workouts, remotely rather than in person.

The league did, however, cancel its annual meeting in late March and has
said its slate of regular-season games overseas will be moved back to
the United States.

Training camps will be particularly critical this year because coaches
were not able to work directly with new draft picks, players acquired
via trades, free agents invited to work out and other new players in
April and June. The new [collective bargaining agreement that was signed
in
mid-March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/sports/football/nfl-cba-approved.html)
allows teams to add two players, increasing the roster size to 55 from
53.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The union and the league are discussing the possibility of increasing
the size of rosters even more to make it easier to find substitutes for
players who are infected with the coronavirus and must go into
quarantine.

### Sports and the Virus

#### 

Updated Sept. 8, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - As the United States Open enters its second week without fans,
        an Italian restaurateur stands outside the gates and [bellows

        his favorite player.
      - The coronavirus pandemic has had an [uneven impact on high

        the United States.
      - The [most complicated puzzle in sports is the return of college
        athletics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-cal-athletics-season.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) during
        a pandemic. The University of California, Berkeley is allowing
        The Times an inside look at their journey’s ups and downs.

Teams must report to training camp 47 days before their first
regular-season game. For the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans,
who open the season on Sept. 10, that means reporting on July 25. Other
teams would be required to start training camp by July 28.

The league has said that to maintain competitive balance, all teams must
open training camp at the same time. Doing so may mean pushing back the
start of training camp because the number of [infections has been rising
in several
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage),
including Arizona, Florida and Texas, that host N.F.L. teams.

The number of players who have been infected is also growing. Ezekiel
Elliott, the [Cowboys’ star running back, confirmed that he tested
positive](https://twitter.com/JoriEpstein/status/1275857955611648001)
for the coronavirus this month. Other members of the Cowboys, as well as
staff members and players from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Houston
Texans, the Los Angeles Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, have also
reportedly tested positive. Von Miller, the star linebacker on the
[Denver Broncos, said in April that he had tested
positive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/sports/football/nfl-coronavirus-von-miller-allen.html),
while New Orleans Saints Coach Sean Payton [also tested
positive](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/saints-hc-sean-payton-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-encourages-others-to-heed-warnings-and-stay-inside/).

Some players, including Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady, have been
flouting the union’s social distancing recommendations by practicing in
groups without wearing personal protective equipment, or P.P.E. On
Thursday, [Brady posted a photo of a
workout](https://twitter.com/gregauman/status/1276200193717948416) to
his Instagram account with a paraphrased quotation from Franklin D.
Roosevelt that read, “Only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.”

Alarmed by rising infection rates and informal practices, the players’
union’s medical director, Thom Mayer, sent [a message to
players](https://twitter.com/NFLPA/status/1274413716612792320) last week
urging them not to participate in group workouts during the off-season.

While other leagues, like the N.B.A. and M.L.S., plan for players,
coaches and staff to live and work in an enclosed community, the N.F.L.
has announced no such plans. Anthony S. Fauci, the country’s highest
ranking specialist in infectious diseases, [cast doubt on the N.F.L.’s
approach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/sports/anthony-fauci-nfl-bubble-coronavirus.html).

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Unless players are essentially in a bubble — insulated from the
community and they are tested nearly every day — it would be very hard
to see how football is able to be played this fall,” [Fauci, the
director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
told
CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/us/football-happen-fauci-spt-trnd/index.html)
last week.

With so many unanswered questions about how to begin training camp
safely, the owners have bought themselves some time by eliminating the
Hall of Fame Game.
