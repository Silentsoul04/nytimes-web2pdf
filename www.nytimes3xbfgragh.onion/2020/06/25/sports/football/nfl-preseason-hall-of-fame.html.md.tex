\section{N.F.L. Trims Early Preseason Game and Prepares for Training
Camps}\label{nfl-trims-early-preseason-game-and-prepares-for-training-camps}}

Team owners canceled the annual Hall of Fame Game, but held firm on
opening training camps in July and the regular season in September.

The N.F.L. on Thursday canceled its annual Hall of Fame Game, an
exhibition scheduled for Aug. 6, so players and coaches grappling with
restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic could have more time to
prepare for the regular season, which, for now, is still set to begin
Sept. 10.

The decision, by team owners in an ad hoc teleconference, gave the
league flexibility to push back, if needed, the start of training camps.
Starting in late July, teams are expected to begin welcoming players to
their facilities.

The league and the players' union are also discussing other measures,
including further
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/sports/football/nfl-preseason-schedule.html}{trimming
the preseason schedule}, which consists of four games per team.

Still, Roger Goodell, the league commissioner, said the N.F.L. was
committed to starting the regular season on time and, if allowed by
state and local officials, having fans in the seats at games.

The most immediate hurdle, though, is preparing for training camps.
While the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/sports/football/coronavirus-nfl-union.html}{league
has established safety protocols} that have allowed front office members
and coaches to return to their offices, the N.F.L. and the N.F.L.
Players Association have not agreed on a set of guidelines, including
testing and quarantines, to govern the return of players. ``Obviously,
there's a lot more to do,'' Goodell said.

Allen Sills, the league's chief medical officer, said in a conference
call with reporters after the meeting that the N.F.L. was in ``very
active discussions'' with the players' union on screening, travel and a
``very ambitious'' testing program, though ``testing alone is not going
to be sufficient to keep everyone healthy.''

``This is all about risk reduction,'' he added. ``We know we can't
eliminate risk.''

Unlike other professional leagues whose seasons were interrupted by the
pandemic in March, the N.F.L. has been able to conduct most of its
normal off-season activities, including free agency, the draft and
off-season workouts, remotely rather than in person.

The league did, however, cancel its annual meeting in late March and has
said its slate of regular-season games overseas will be moved back to
the United States.

Training camps will be particularly critical this year because coaches
were not able to work directly with new draft picks, players acquired
via trades, free agents invited to work out and other new players in
April and June. The new
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/sports/football/nfl-cba-approved.html}{collective
bargaining agreement that was signed in mid-March} allows teams to add
two players, increasing the roster size to 55 from 53.

The union and the league are discussing the possibility of increasing
the size of rosters even more to make it easier to find substitutes for
players who are infected with the coronavirus and must go into
quarantine.

Teams must report to training camp 47 days before their first
regular-season game. For the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans,
who open the season on Sept. 10, that means reporting on July 25. Other
teams would be required to start training camp by July 28.

The league has said that to maintain competitive balance, all teams must
open training camp at the same time. Doing so may mean pushing back the
start of training camp because the number of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click\&module=Spotlight\&pgtype=Homepage}{infections
has been rising in several states}, including Arizona, Florida and
Texas, that host N.F.L. teams.

The number of players who have been infected is also growing. Ezekiel
Elliott, the
\href{https://twitter.com/JoriEpstein/status/1275857955611648001}{Cowboys'
star running back, confirmed that he tested positive} for the
coronavirus this month. Other members of the Cowboys, as well as staff
members and players from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Houston Texans,
the Los Angeles Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, have also reportedly
tested positive. Von Miller, the star linebacker on the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/sports/football/nfl-coronavirus-von-miller-allen.html}{Denver
Broncos, said in April that he had tested positive}, while New Orleans
Saints Coach Sean Payton
\href{https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/saints-hc-sean-payton-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-encourages-others-to-heed-warnings-and-stay-inside/}{also
tested positive}.

Some players, including Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady, have been
flouting the union's social distancing recommendations by practicing in
groups without wearing personal protective equipment, or P.P.E. On
Thursday,
\href{https://twitter.com/gregauman/status/1276200193717948416}{Brady
posted a photo of a workout} to his Instagram account with a paraphrased
quotation from Franklin D. Roosevelt that read, ``Only thing we have to
fear, is fear itself.''

Alarmed by rising infection rates and informal practices, the players'
union's medical director, Thom Mayer, sent
\href{https://twitter.com/NFLPA/status/1274413716612792320}{a message to
players} last week urging them not to participate in group workouts
during the off-season.

While other leagues, like the N.B.A. and M.L.S., plan for players,
coaches and staff to live and work in an enclosed community, the N.F.L.
has announced no such plans. Anthony S. Fauci, the country's highest
ranking specialist in infectious diseases,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/sports/anthony-fauci-nfl-bubble-coronavirus.html}{cast
doubt on the N.F.L.'s approach}.

``Unless players are essentially in a bubble --- insulated from the
community and they are tested nearly every day --- it would be very hard
to see how football is able to be played this fall,''
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/us/football-happen-fauci-spt-trnd/index.html}{Fauci,
the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, told CNN} last week.

With so many unanswered questions about how to begin training camp
safely, the owners have bought themselves some time by eliminating the
Hall of Fame Game.
