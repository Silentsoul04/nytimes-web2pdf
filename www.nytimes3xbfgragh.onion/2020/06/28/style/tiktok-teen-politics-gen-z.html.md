# TikTok Is Shaping Politics. But How?

</div>

Two researchers have studied political expression on the app since the
Musical.ly era. Here’s what they found.

As a place where millions of young Americans perform and explore their
identities in public,
[TikTok](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html)
has become a prominent venue for ideological formation, political
activism and trolling. It has [homegrown
pundits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/style/tiktok-politics-bernie-trump.html),
and despite its parent company’s reluctance to be involved with politics
— the service does not allow political ads — it has attracted interest
from campaigns. It is also a space where people can be gathered and
pressed into action quickly.

TikTok was instrumental in the organization of a [mass
false-registration
drive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html)
ahead of a Trump rally in Tulsa, Okla., where many seats were unfilled.
It has amplified footage of police brutality as well as scenes and
commentary from Black Lives Matter protests around the world, with
videos created and shared on the platform frequently moving beyond it.
They carry TikTok’s distinctive and wide-ranging audiovisual vernacular:
often playfully disorienting, carefully edited, arch and musical. It has
been suggested by many, including The New York Times, [that TikTok teens
will save the
world](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/opinion/trump-protest-gen-z.html).

The truth is more complicated. A team of researchers has been analyzing
political expression on TikTok since, well, before it was TikTok. While
nonusers of TikTok may think it’s bursting onto the political stage
rather suddenly, and that it has something like a collective political
identity, the research gives a different picture.

It depicts a diverse, diffuse and not nearly united community of
millions of young people discovering the capabilities and limits of a
platform that is, despite its many similarities with predecessors, a
unique and strange place.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In an email exchange, Ioana Literat, an assistant professor of
communication and media at Teachers College, Columbia University, and
Neta Kligler-Vilenchik, an assistant professor of communication at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, discussed the characteristics of
political expression on TikTok and why it feels like a novel phenomenon.

This interview has been edited.

**The idea that TikTok is an engine for progressive young politics is
gaining some currency among people who don’t use the platform. What
might outsiders be surprised to find on TikTok, in terms of youth
political expression? Is there anything resembling consensus?**

**Ioana Literat:** I’ve noticed this tendency recently, not only on
older social media like Twitter but also in the press. It plays into
larger debates about youth civic attitudes — and especially youth civic
attitudes online — which tend to verge between utopia and dystopia.

On the one hand, youth are hailed (or tokenized — think Greta Thunberg
and the Parkland youth) as the future of democracy, for whom political
expression comes easy. But on the other hand, people are worried about
how they don’t show up at the polls, or fall prey to misinformation, or
don’t care about newspapers anymore. And all of these are true; it’s not
an either/or kind of situation.

**Neta Kligler-Vilenchik:** Extreme views, ranging from dystopian to
utopian, are voiced not only in regard to youth, but also in regard to
any media phenomenon that is significant and new. As early as Socrates’s
concern that the written word would eradicate wisdom, every new
technology has been believed to either be our savior (the internet will
bring people around the world into one global community\!) or our doom
(robots will make us all unemployed\!).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To me, this continuity is quite reassuring, because it shows us that our
fears and hopes are not so much around the traits of the specific new
technology, rather they are broad societal fears and hopes that are
projected onto whatever technology is new and not yet understood. To
most of its adult commenters, TikTok is a big unknown.

**Dr. Literat:** In terms of youth political expression, while there’s a
dynamic and influential liberal activist community on TikTok, there’s
actually plenty of conservative political expression, and [pro-Trump
voices](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/13/style/trump-tiktok.html)
definitely find an audience on the platform.

We found this to be true [in our early research
on](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444819837571)[Musical.ly](http://musical.ly/),
in the aftermath of the 2016 election, and it’s still true today on
TikTok, as we’re gearing up for the 2020 election. On TikTok, you can
find powerful political statements and activist organizing. You can find
young people lip-syncing speeches by Trump or Obama (both earnestly and
sarcastically). You can also find plenty of racist and sexist content,
conspiracy theories and misinformation, and kids showing off their gun
collections and posing with Confederate flags.

It’s hard to refer to what we see on the platform as consensus. Rather,
we find that TikTok enables collective political expression for youth —
that is, it allows them to deliberately connect to a like-minded
audience by using shared symbolic resources.

**Dr. Kligler-Vilenchik:** Shared symbolic resources can be physical
(MAGA hats), visual (the closed fist for the Black Lives Matter
movement) or hashtags (\#alllivesmatter). TikTok-specific elements like
viral dances, popular soundtracks, etc. are also shared symbolic
resources that help facilitate connections and foreground the collective
aspects of youth political expression.

**Are there novel ways in which political conflict unfolds on TikTok? It
doesn’t seem to be especially well suited to the sorts of conflict we’re
familiar with on some older platforms.**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Dr. Literat:** There’s relatively little crosscutting political talk
(i.e. across partisan lines, with politically heterogeneous others). And
when it does happen, it’s not very productive. It’s still a very
polarized discussion of us v. them.

Something that’s pretty special about TikTok in terms of both political
expression and political dialogue/conflict is that it’s all filtered
through young people’s personal identities and experiences. Political
dialogue on the platform is very personal, and youth will often state
diverse social identities — e.g. Black, Mexican, L.G.B.T.Q., redneck,
country — in direct relation to their political views.

Not to say that political talk on other social media platforms is not
personal, but having done comparative analyses, we’re really struck by
just how front-and-center youth identities are on TikTok.

**Dr. Kligler-Vilenchik:** If we return to the idea of collective
political expression as the ability to speak to a like-minded audience
through shared symbolic resources, we see that this enables at least the
potential for a conversation across political views.

So, some users may choose to tag their video with \#bluelivesmatter and
speak to a certain audience. But they can also choose to tag their video
with \#blacklivesmatter, and that way reach a different audience, with a
different view. Often this is done ironically, as a parody of others’
views (e.g., a video tagged \#whitelivesmatter that goes on to explain
the idea of white privilege), but it may also be a way to spark
conversation between sides.

**Lastly, if you’ve been able to check in, have you noticed anything
surprising about youth expression on TikTok around BLM, racism and
policing in the last few weeks?**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Dr. Literat:** The collective aspects of youth political expression —
which materialize, for instance, in frequently used songs like Childish
Gambino’s “This Is America” — are very salient in the context of
BLM-related expression on TikTok.

Like hashtags, these songs function as connective threads among the
videos. At the same time, there is such a wide variety in terms of style
and ethos of expression, from anger to silliness to humor, from
confessionals to original songs to footage of protests to memes to
interviews or oral histories.

There’s also a sense of generational awareness and generational
solidarity, which is connected to this concept of collective political
expression. On footage of protests, you see a lot of comments like “Gen
Z is changing the world,” “our generation is so powerful,” “I love our
generation with all my heart” — which is really interesting because
generations, and especially terms like Gen Z or Gen Alpha, are how
outsiders (academics, commenters, brands, etc.) usually refer to youth.

It may be that youth are reclaiming these terms to assert their agency,
or perhaps these larger societal discourses are seeping into youth
discourse too.

**Dr. Kligler-Vilenchik:** Looking at what’s going on in the U.S. right
now from outside (I’m in Israel), I’m struck by how these same hashtags
are also used by people from outside the U.S. to support the Black Lives
Matter movement and also connect it to localized instances of racism and
anti-government protest.

In Israel, protests in solidarity with BLM were infused with the protest
of Ethiopian-origin Israelis who suffer from racial discrimination and
police brutality. This speaks to how TikTok enables young people to
connect a personalized political message to a broader political moment.
