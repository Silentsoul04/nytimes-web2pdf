# What China’s New National Security Law Means for Hong Kong

</div>

Chinese lawmakers have approved the law, threatening to curb free speech
and protest in Hong Kong after a year of political tumult.

Chinese lawmakers [have approved a national security
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law-rules.html),
drastically curbing political [protest and dissent in Hong
Kong](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/28/world/asia/china-hong-kong-national-security-law.html)
and adding to Beijing’s tensions with Western powers.

The National People’s Congress Standing Committee — an arm of China’s
Communist Party-run legislature — [discussed the draft law twice this
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law.html),
including a three-day session that started on Sunday. But even as Hong
Kong news media reported on Tuesday that the law had passed, the city’s
residents were still waiting to see its full text.

China’s Communist Party leaders have long worried about opposition to
their rule in Hong Kong, which was a British colony until 1997. The
[Basic
Law](https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/images/basiclaw_full_text_en.pdf),
which enshrines Hong Kong’s special legal status, says the
semiautonomous territory should enact legislation that outlaws “any act
of treason, secession, sedition, subversion.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Full details have not been released, but the security law is expected to
deter speech, protests and news media critical of the Chinese
government, threatening the territory’s independent press and democratic
opposition.

Many Hong Kong residents are proudly protective of their rights under
the territory’s separate legal system and have opposed attempts to pass
such legislation. A previous push by Hong Kong’s leaders to enact a
national security law foundered in 2003 after nearly 500,000 people
[joined a street
protest](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/07/02/world/security-laws-target-of-huge-hong-kong-protest.html)
against it.

China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has been impatient to impose control
over Hong Kong. After the territory erupted in monthslong protests last
year over a proposed extradition law, a Communist Party meeting [in
October demanded
steps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/31/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-china.html)
to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong.

The National People’s Congress Standing Committee usually meets every
two months or so. This time, the committee met just a little over a week
[after it first discussed the security legislation at its last
session](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-06/20/c_139153887.htm).
The timing of the latest session suggested that Mr. Xi wanted the law
passed before July 1, the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to
Chinese
sovereignty.

Legal experts had been uncertain how Mr. Xi could introduce a national
security law into Hong Kong without going through the city’s Legislative
Council, a body stacked with pro-Beijing members who have, nonetheless,
hesitated to take such a contentious step.

But Mr. Xi made a bold move to break the impasse in May, when a full
session of the National People’s Congress [nearly unanimously passed a
resolution](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/28/world/asia/china-hong-kong-crackdown.html)
empowering the Congress’s Standing Committee to bring state security
legislation into the Basic Law.

The central government’s decision to impose a law effectively
circumvents the Hong Kong legislature. Even Hong Kong politicians who
have endorsed the law, including the territory’s top official, Carrie
Lam, have said they have [not been shown the full
text](https://sc.isd.gov.hk/TuniS/www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202006/23/P2020062300464.htm)
by Beijing, which will bring into Hong Kong new crimes like inciting
separatism and “colluding with foreign powers.”

The law will also establish a new security agency in the territory to
enforce the security restrictions, and Beijing will create its own
separate security arm in Hong Kong, empowered to investigate special
cases and collect intelligence, according to a summary issued by China’s
legislature.

The legislation also gives the territory’s chief official, who must
answer to Beijing, the power to decide which judges are empowered to
hear trials for state security charges, limiting the autonomy of the
city’s
judiciary.

## Many residents fear the law.

Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s local leader, has sought to reassure the public
that their “legitimate rights and freedoms” will be safeguarded. She and
other politicians who support the law have also said that it will target
only a tiny minority of lawbreakers.

Pro-democracy activists have denounced the proposed law, and the [Hong
Kong Bar
Association](https://www.hkba.org/sites/default/files/20200525%20-%20Proposal%20of%20National%20People%27s%20Congress%20to%20enact%20National%20Security%20Law%20in%20Hong%20Kong%20%28E%29.pdf)
has called it unconstitutional.

The Hong Kong police force has [denied
applications](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1534408-20200627.htm)
from three groups — the League of Social Democrats, the Civil Human
Rights Front and pro-democracy district officials — to hold marches
opposing the law on July 1, the politically sensitive anniversary of
Hong Kong’s handover to Chinese rule, citing risks from the coronavirus
and dangers of violence. If the police decision survives appeal, it
would be the first time since 2003 that a march on July 1 has been
banned, **** the Civil Human Rights Front said. Some protesters may
ignore the order and march.

A survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in mid-June
found that 49 percent of respondents “very much oppose” the security
legislation, while another 7 percent “somewhat oppose” it, [Reuters
reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-poll-exclusive/exclusive-support-dips-for-hong-kong-democracy-protests-as-national-security-law-looms-poll-idUSKBN23W3KO).
But the survey also indicated that public backing for street
demonstrations had softened: Support for protests fell to 51 percent,
down from 58 percent in a poll in
March.

## Western governments object.

As China moved forward with plans to impose security laws in Hong Kong,
foreign governments criticized the decision. Foreign ministers from the
Group of 7 leading industrialized democracies [called on
China](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3089494/group-seven-countries-urge-china-reconsider-hong-kong-national-security)
this month to abandon the law, saying that it would undermine the
autonomy of the territory.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [said on
Friday](https://www.state.gov/u-s-department-of-state-imposes-visa-restrictions-on-chinese-communist-party-officials-for-undermining-hong-kongs-high-degree-of-autonomy-and-restricting-human-rights/)
that the United States would impose visa restrictions on Chinese
officials, including retired ones “believed to be responsible for, or
complicit in, undermining Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy.” He did
not name any officials or say how many might be barred.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain [has
promised](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/world/europe/boris-johnson-uk-hong-kong-china.html)
to allow nearly three million people from Hong Kong to live and work in
the country. Mr. Johnson, however, has left unanswered questions about
how those admitted might be able to obtain British citizenship.

Taiwan said this month that it would expand efforts to provide refuge to
protesters and others who wish to leave Hong Kong. The government said
it could, in certain cases, provide work and study visas, as well as
assistance securing housing and jobs.
