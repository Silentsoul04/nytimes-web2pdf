Before a camping and kayaking trip along the Texas Coast, Pam LeBlanc
and Jimmy Harvey decided to get coronavirus tests. They wanted a bit
more peace of mind before spending 13 days in close quarters along with
three friends.

The two got drive-through
[tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/parenting/kids-covid-19-test.html)
at Austin Emergency Center in Austin. The center
[advertises](https://www.austinemergencycenters.net/covid) a “minimally
invasive” testing experience in a state now battling one of the
country’s worst coronavirus outbreaks. Texas recorded [5,799 new cases
Sunday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html),
and recently
[reversed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-florida-texas-bars-closing.html)some
if its reopening policies.

They both recalled how uncomfortable it was to have the long nasal swab
pushed up their noses. Ms. LeBlanc’s eyes started to tear up; Mr. Harvey
felt as if the swab “was in my brain.”

Their
[tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/parenting/kids-covid-19-test.html)
came back with the same result — negative, allowing the trip to go ahead
— but the accompanying bills were quite different.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The emergency room charged Mr. Harvey $199 in cash. Ms. LeBlanc, who
paid with insurance, was charged $6,408.

“I assumed, like an idiot, it would be cheaper to use my insurance than
pay cash right there,” Ms. LeBlanc said. “This is 32 times the cost of
what my friend paid for the exact same thing.”

Ms. LeBlanc’s health insurer negotiated the total bill down to $1,128.
The plan said she was responsible for $928 of
that.

During the pandemic, there has been [wide
variation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/upshot/coronavirus-test-cost-varies-widely.html)
between what providers bill for the same basic diagnostic test, with
some charging $27, others $2,315. It turns out there is also significant
variation in how much a test can cost two patients at the same location.

Mr. Harvey and Ms. LeBlanc were among four New York Times readers who
shared bills they received from the same chain **** of emergency rooms
in Austin. Their experiences offer a rare window into the unpredictable
way health prices vary for patients who receive seemingly identical
care.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Three paid with insurance, and one with cash. Even after negotiations
between insurers and the emergency room, the total that patients and
their insurers ended up paying varied by 2,700 percent.

Such discrepancies arise from a fundamental fact about the American
health care system: The government does not regulate health care prices.

Some academic research confirms that prices can vary within the same
hospital. One [2015 paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21815) found
substantial within-hospital price differences for basic procedures, such
as M.R.I. scans, depending on the health insurer.

The researchers say these differences aren’t about quality. In all
likelihood, the expensive M.R.I.s and the cheap M.R.I.s are done on the
same machine. Instead, they reflect different insurers’ market clout. A
large insurer with many members can demand lower prices, while small
insurers have less negotiating leverage.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Because health prices in the United States are so opaque, some
researchers have turned to their own medical bills to understand this
type of price variation. Two health researchers who gave birth at the
same hospital with the same insurance compared notes afterward. They
found that one received a surprise $1,600 bill while the other one
didn’t.

The difference? One woman happened to give birth while an out-of-network
anesthesiologist was staffing the maternity ward; the other received her
epidural from an in-network provider.

“The additional out-of-pocket charge on top of the other labor and
delivery expenses was left entirely up to chance,” the co-authors Erin
Taylor and Layla Parast [wrote in a blog
post](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20151103.051586/full/)summarizing
the experience. Ms. Parast, who received the surprise bill, ultimately
got it reversed but not until her baby was nearly a year old.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Trump administration has taken steps to limit patients’
out-of-pocket costs for coronavirus testing and treatment, using relief
funds [to reimburse
providers](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/04/27/hhs-launches-covid19-uninsured-program-portal.html)
for uninsured patients’ bills. Insurers are required to cover patients’
coronavirus tests with no cost-sharing or co-payments. Alex Azar, the
health and human services secretary, reiterated that commitment in [a
Sunday interview on
CNN](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/28/us/politics/coronavirus-sunday-talk-shows.html),
saying, “If you are uninsured, it will be covered by us.”

The testing experience of the Texas group suggests that it doesn’t
always work out that way. Some emergency rooms charge cash prices and
tack on testing fees that insurers are not required to cover. In this
case, the patient who paid cash actually got the best deal. Mr. Harvey
has health insurance but felt it would be a “hassle” to use it for the
coronavirus test. So he paid for his test with two $100 bills after
receiving the nasal swab, and was on his way.

Ms. LeBlanc let the emergency room take a photograph of her insurance
card. She ended up with $6,408 in charges, mostly from an outside lab
called Genesis Laboratory that handled her testing. She received
explanation-of-benefit statements suggesting she would owe more than
$1,000.

Jay Lenner, who also got a drive-through test from the same provider,
used his insurance and received a similarly long list of charges. He
recalls a provider saying he’d be tested only for coronavirus, but bill
records show he was also screened for Legionnaires’ disease, herpes and
enterovirus, among other things.

The emergency room also charged him $1,684 for using its facility and
$634 to see one of its doctors. All told, he ended up with $5,649 in
bills, of which his insurance plan paid $4,914. Mr. Lenner didn’t end up
on the hook for any of it, but he’s still frustrated. “Ultimately, we
pay for this in higher premiums,” he said.

Michelle Tribble, a spokeswoman for Austin Emergency Center, said it
needed to charge high prices because insurers often pay only a small
share of their fees.

“For emergency room visits, the reimbursement to us by insurance
companies is typically a fifth or a third of total charges,” she said.
“If an insurance company were to bill a patient for an out-of-network
visit to our emergency room, our billing company would go to bat for
that patient and would appeal on their behalf.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Austin Emergency Center and Genesis Laboratory had differing
explanations for why patients like Mr. Lenner were screened for so many
conditions. Ms. Tribble said “the lab makes the determination” of what
to test for. Edward Cienki, a spokesman for the laboratory, said,
“Genesis does not order clinical laboratory tests.”

Ms. LeBlanc learned of the discrepancy only because her husband happened
to be on the phone with Mr. Harvey when a price estimate from her
insurer arrived in the mail. Mr. Harvey said, “I hear Pam in the
background saying, ‘What the heck is this?’”

She used the information about what her friend had paid to negotiate her
charges down to $199 as well. And after she reached out to a local
television station, which devoted a
[segment](https://www.kxan.com/investigations/austin-woman-trying-to-sort-out-6400-in-charges-for-one-covid-19-test/)to
her charges, her health plan began investigating the bill.

Last Thursday, after returning from another camping trip, Ms. LeBlanc
learned the bill would be dropped entirely.
