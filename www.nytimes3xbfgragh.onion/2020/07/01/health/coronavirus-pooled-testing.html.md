The Trump administration plans to adopt a decades-old testing strategy
that will vastly increase the number of [coronavirus
tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/health/coronavirus-pool-te.html)
performed in the United States and permit widespread tracking of the
virus as it surges across the country.

The method, called [pooled
testing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/health/coronavirus-pool-te.html),
signals a paradigm shift. Instead of carefully rationing tests to only
those with symptoms, pooled testing would enable frequent surveillance
of asymptomatic people. Mass identification of coronavirus infections
could hasten the reopening of schools, offices and factories.

“We’re in intensive discussions about how we’re going to do it,” Dr.
Anthony S. Fauci, the country’s leading infectious disease expert, said
in an interview. “We hope to get this off the ground as soon as
possible.”

In a call with reporters on Wednesday, Adm. Brett Giroir, deputy
secretary of health and human services, said he expected the program to
be up and running by the end of the summer.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“My assessment is that the data is very strong,” he said. By the time
students return to universities, “pooling will be very mature.”

Given the many advantages, experts said, health officials should have
embraced pooled testing much sooner. The United States military has used
the technique at its bases worldwide, and has done so since it first
[tested men for
syphilis](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177731363) in the
1940s.

Health officials in
[China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/world/asia/coronavirus-testing-china-wuhan.html),
Germany, Israel and Thailand have all deployed pooled testing for the
coronavirus. In Nebraska, a state scientist found a loophole that
allowed him to circumvent federal prohibitions on the method. In
Memphis, Dr. Manoj Jain, an infectious disease expert familiar with
low-cost methods in India, has forged an ambitious plan to use the
strategy.

“I’m just wondering why the federal government does not mandate now that
this be done to preserve the testing capacity,” said Dr. Jain, of Emory
University. “We really haven’t learned from our counterparts in Europe
and Asia.”

Here’s how the technique works: A university, for example, takes samples
from every one of its thousands of students by nasal swab, or perhaps
saliva. Setting aside part of each individual’s sample, the lab combines
the rest into a batch holding five to 10 samples each.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The pooled sample is tested for coronavirus infection. Barring an
unexpected outbreak, just 1 percent or 2 percent of the students are
likely to be infected, so the overwhelming majority of pools are likely
to test
negative.

But if a pool yields a positive result, the lab would retest the
reserved parts of each individual sample that went into the pool,
pinpointing the infected student. The strategy could be employed for [as
little as $3 per person per
day](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ned/GroupTestingInAPandemic.pdf),
according an estimate from economists at the University of California,
Berkeley.

By testing large numbers of people at a fraction of the cost, time and
necessary ingredients, pooled surveillance could be widely adopted by
workplaces, religious organizations, and schools and universities
seeking to reopen.

The method works best in such settings, where the number infected is
likely to be low, rather than in high-risk workplaces like meatpacking
plants.

The technique was used to process tests for H.I.V. as that epidemic took
root in the United States, recalled Dr. Fauci, who said he had been
recommending it to federal officials for months. “Right now, there
clearly is a very open, sympathetic ear to this,” he said.

Asked why the administration’s stance has changed now, Dr. Fauci
referred to the alarming rise in infections nationwide. “Obviously,
things are not going in the right direction,” he said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the absence of federal guidance, some health officials have forged
ahead on their own.

In mid-March, as the number of infections in Nebraska climbed, the state
was running out of supplies needed for coronavirus tests. The state lab
had for years screened pooled samples of donated blood for pathogens and
from pregnant women for sexually transmitted diseases.

Peter Iwen, the lab’s director, estimated that pooling coronavirus
samples could conserve supplies and [increase testing
capacity](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article/153/6/715/5822023) by at
least 70 percent. He tried to persuade officials at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention to allow its assay to be used for pooled
testing.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“They told me it’s an interesting concept, that’s as far as it went,” he
said.

Dr. Iwen also appealed to the Food and Drug Administration. Officials
said the agency could not comment on pending applications for emergency
use authorizations.

But Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska had [declared a state of
emergency](https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/gov-ricketts-issues-emergency-declaration-covid-19)
on March 13, which meant that certain federal and state rules could be
superseded. With permission from the governor, Dr. Iwen moved to put
pooled testing in place.

Looking for ideas to contain a coming surge in coronavirus infections,
Mayor Jim Strickland of Memphis called Dr. Jain, who recalled a World
Health Organization mission to India in November where he had seen
pooled testing for tuberculosis.

Dr. Jain, like Dr. Iwen, found that in the federal government, “there
was no one really encouraging this to be done.” But he proceeded with
the mayor’s blessing. Hundreds of Memphis firefighters, police officers
and city workers volunteered to swab their own noses.

The lab tested the samples in batches of three, five, seven or 10, and
determined that pooling seemed to work best with batches of seven. The
data were submitted to the F.D.A.; the agency has responded positively,
but has not yet authorized the pooled method, Dr. Jain said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Pooled surveillance has its limitations. The savings in time and expense
thin out when the number of infected people rises above 10 per 100.
Because so many pools then are likely to yield positive results,
laboratories wind up testing huge numbers of individual samples.

Nebraska, for example, suspended its program about a month ago when
meatpacking plants in the state exploded with coronavirus infections and
the rate of positive samples arriving at the lab spiked above 10
percent.

The technique also loses accuracy beyond that range. Dr. Jain said that
weakness was not a pressing concern, because pooled testing’s main goal
is to identify people who have a high viral load and could transmit the
virus, not simply to find every infected
person.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

“This is not a diagnostic test, but a screening test,” he said. “The bar
can be much lower for a screening test.”

The F.D.A. has [released
guidelines](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-facilitating-diagnostic-test-availability-asymptomatic-testing-and)
for developers to adapt their tests to pooled samples. The agency is
also asking manufacturers to permit labs to use the tests without being
explicitly authorized by the F.D.A. to do so.

“If the F.D.A. is able to do this, I think it would be a big deal for
the U.S.,” Dr. Iwen said.

Federal law forbids any lab [without the right
credentials](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA)
from conducting diagnostic tests and revealing the results to patients.
But on June 19, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which
oversees lab testing, said it did not consider [pooled surveillance to
be
diagnostic](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/06-19-2020-frequently-asked-questions-covid-surveillance-testing.pdf)
— meaning any private or academic lab can screen and reveal the grouped
results from a pool to the set of patients who contributed samples.

But if a batch tests positive, the retesting of each patient’s sample
would be considered a diagnosis and need to come from a certified lab —
tacking on a delay of several days for the verdict — noted Kelly
Wroblewski, chief of infectious diseases at the Association of Public
Health Laboratories.

“That’s where I think we probably start to disagree with pooling as a
strategy,” Ms. Wroblewski said. The F.D.A. and C.M.S. have always
required screening tests to be done at a certified lab, so the change in
policy needs further discussion, she said.

She added that pooling was also unlikely to be useful at most state
labs, which now tend to see samples from at least 15 infected people for
every 100, well above the recommended cutoff of 10 percent. “I don’t
think it’s going to solve all our problems,” she said.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the C.D.C., warned that any
testing strategy was unlikely to succeed without isolation of those
tested until results are available, and reasonable options for isolating
away from the home for anyone who is found to be infected.

“What I find both frustrating and dangerous is the consistent failure to
understand that testing, in and of itself, pooled or not, does little or
no good,” Dr. Frieden said in a email.

“What good is testing if the results take four days to come back and
infectious people aren’t isolated in the interim? What good is testing
if contact tracing doesn’t identify and warn exposed people quickly?”

Dr. Fauci acknowledged that the country was not adequately isolating
people. But, he added, above a certain level of infection, “the core
paradigm of identification, isolation and contact tracing just doesn’t
work.”

Faced with rising cases in multiple states, he said, the administration
is consulting with statisticians to estimate the ideal proportions for a
pool in a particular location.

In the meantime, more states have come around to the idea. Dr. Iwen said
that in the past three weeks, about a dozen state lab directors had
contacted him to ask about Nebraska’s experience.

Even in states like Arizona, where the percentage of positive tests may
exceed 20 percent, pooled testing could be used in settings such as
schools where the prevalence is likely to be much lower, he said —
especially as the shortage of testing supplies continues to be a
problem.

“We’re being asked to expand surveillance testing to large populations
of people, and there quite frankly is not enough reagents to be able to
do that,” he said, referring to chemicals used in diagnostic tests.
“It’s becoming a national discussion now.”
