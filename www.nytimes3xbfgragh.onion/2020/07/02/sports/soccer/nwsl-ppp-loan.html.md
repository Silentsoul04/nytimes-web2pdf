# Federal Loan Saved a Soccer Season Nearly Lost to the Pandemic

</div>

The N.W.S.L. was one of millions of businesses that took Paycheck
Protection Program loans this year. The money got the league and its
players through eight uncertain weeks.

As the coronavirus pandemic spread early this year, shutting down large
portions of the United States economy, the federal government handed out
more than $520 billion in forgivable loans to more than five million
small businesses. Called the [Paycheck Protection
Program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/us/ppp-small-business-loans.html),
the money was to be used to replace the incomes of employees suddenly
unable to work as cities and states entered lockdowns to reduce
infection rates.

The recipients ranged from clothing stores to car dealerships to coffee
shops.

They also included a women’s professional soccer league.

The National Women’s Soccer League confirmed Thursday afternoon that it
had received an unspecified amount from the program, and had used the
money as a bridge to pay players for two months. It expects the loan to
be forgiven.

Other sports entities were publicly involved in the rocky beginnings of
the Paycheck Protection Program. The Los Angeles Lakers — the
eighth-richest sports franchise in the world, by one measurement —
[secured a $4.6 million
loan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/us/politics/coronavirus-treasury-payment-protection-program.html)
before quickly returning it amid news reports that smaller companies in
desperate need of the funds were finding it hard to access the program.
The United States Soccer Federation [returned the money it had received,
too](https://www.espn.com/soccer/united-states-usa/story/4095017/us-soccer-returns-paycheck-protection-loan-to-us-treasury),
once it became clear that the layoffs and furloughs it had implemented
would disqualify it for loan forgiveness.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the N.W.S.L. desperately needed the money as it sought to salvage
its eighth season — not to mention several hundred jobs. One hundred
percent of the funds were used to pay player salaries for more than two
months, the league said.

“Our sole intent in applying for the P.P.P. loan was to continue player
compensation,” said Lisa Baird, the league’s first-year commissioner.
“With ours, the calculus was pretty simple. Either you’re going to pay
your players or you’re going to furlough them. What could we do?”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The decision to apply for the loan came amid Baird’s tumultuous start as
commissioner. She officially took over the position on March 10. Two
days later, she shut down the league in response to the pandemic. She
called this period “the fog.” The league, like every other business, was
scrambling.

“Nobody knew what was going on,” she said.

Baird said the N.W.S.L., as a small operation with a brief history and
only a few hundred employees, was almost entirely reliant on stadium
ticket sales and local sponsorships for revenue. Those disappeared when
this spring’s games were called off. When Baird took the job, the league
had only two national sponsors.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After consulting with league officials and owners, Baird said she
gathered a thousand backup documents — “literally a thousand” — and sat
at her computer for six hours to personally submit the application.

“Over 85 percent of our total monthly expenses is player compensation,”
she said of the league’s finances. “I didn’t even want to stare at the
alternatives. For me, I had to have this happen.”

In important ways, the N.W.S.L. fulfilled the strict qualifications set
out by the federal government relief program: A relatively young
business, it had fewer than 500 employees; the pandemic had effectively
barred its employees from working; and its workers’ incomes, and perhaps
careers, could have disappeared altogether if the league had been unable
to play matches.

Baird, who has only 16 people on staff to go along with more than 200
players, described the P.P.P. funding as the bridge that allowed them to
escape the early danger of the pandemic. (The league’s top players and
biggest earners — more than two dozen members of the women’s national
team — are paid by U.S. Soccer.)

The loan gave the league the wiggle room to plan an improvised
summertime tournament [that began last week in
Utah](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/sports/soccer/nwsl-anthem-protest-kaiya-mccullough.html)
and to secure commitments from [three new national
sponsors](https://twitter.com/NWSL/status/1265612731186634755). Those
new deals, Baird said, will help ensure that players will be paid and
get all of their health benefits for the rest of the
year.

The Lakers episode, though, showed how touchy people could be about
learning that sports teams and leagues — not to mention prominent brands
like Shake Shack and the Fortune 500 car retailer AutoNation — had
[applied for and received relief
funds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/us/politics/coronavirus-treasury-payment-protection-program.html).
In England, soccer teams like Tottenham and Newcastle United were
criticized by their own fans for seeking large government loans amid the
coronavirus crisis.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Baird said that she and the league’s owners, who include wealthy
businessmen, [a prominent French soccer
club](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-women-nwsl/lyon-parent-company-acquires-nwsls-reign-fc-idUSKBN1YO002)
and even [the governor of New Jersey](https://skybluefc.com/ownership/),
had weighed the pros and cons and discussed the possibility of receiving
negative attention for applying for the loan. But they quickly realized
that it was too important for them to be able to pay the players, she
said. In the N.W.S.L., rank-and-file players are employees of the
league, not of the individual teams.

“That benefit outweighed anything that we could think of in terms of
optics,” Baird
said.

Baird said she expected the league’s P.P.P. loan would qualify for
forgiveness because 100 percent of the money was used for payroll (the
government requires that at least 60 percent of the funds be used for
payroll for a loan to be forgiven) and because the N.W.S.L. did not lay
off any employees, another condition.

“I pray for that in my nightly prayers,” said Baird, who said she and
some other highly compensated league officials had taken pay cuts in a
separate attempt at belt-tightening.

Having used the loan as a lifeboat, Baird on Thursday cautiously deemed
the summer and the nascent tournament a success.

An entire team, the Orlando Pride, dropped out before play even began
after six players and four staff members tested positive for the virus.
But the first game — in which players made headlines for kneeling during
the national anthem — drew the highest television rating in the league’s
history.

“It gives us confidence that we can be a small business that can make it
through this time,” Baird said. “That’s a key thing: We’re not a large
business. We’re a small business.”
