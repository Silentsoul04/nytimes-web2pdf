On Aug. 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th
Amendment. Eight days later, ratification was certified by the secretary
of state. The right to vote for women across the United States was
officially enshrined in the Constitution.

The codification of suffrage was the result of nearly a century of
activism, which began even before the Seneca Falls convention in 1848.
From those early years to the formation of the National American Woman
Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1890 to the Woman Suffrage Procession in
Washington in 1913, generations of American women and men devoted their
lives to fighting for the vote. The movement was a decades-long game of
democratic Telephone: Of the 68 women who gathered in that town in
upstate New York and declared what was then a radical notion — that all
men *and* women were created equal — only one, [Charlotte Woodward
Pierce](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/only-one-woman-who-was-seneca-falls-lived-see-women-win-vote-180964044/),
would live to see their dream become a reality.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And their struggle did not end with the amendment. Well after 1920,
there were many women in the United States, including Native Americans
and Chinese immigrants, who were not able to vote and many more,
particularly African-Americans, for whom it was extremely difficult. One
hundred years later, the country is continuing to grapple with many of
the same questions the suffragists raised, not only who gets to vote but
also what it means to be a citizen and how to ensure that all Americans
are equal in the eyes of the law. And as we mark this centennial, the
generation that came after the suffragists, and the ones that have come
after that, are still in the fight.

“Learning your history is an essential tool, and a call to action,” said
Liza Mickens, a great-great-granddaughter of the suffragist Maggie Lena
Walker. “I’m honored to be a part of this legacy.” (Interviews have been

Adella’s portrait — the one that’s the cover of my book “[Princess of
the Hither Isles: A Black Suffragist’s Story from the Jim Crow
South](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300242607/princess-hither-isles)”
— hung in my parents’ apartment, so she’s always been a visible,
physical presence in my life, even though she died when my father was
only 6 years old. And, of course, I was named for her. When I was in my
early 40s, a young historian who was working on a Ph.D. dissertation
about Black women in the suffrage movement was the first one to show me
Adella’s writings. I hadn’t had that kind of specifics before, and I got
totally hooked on trying to find out more about her as a suffragist. My
father was dead by that time, so I asked my mother, “Did you know all
this?” And her response was, “Of course.” Not only was Adella involved,
but my mother’s mother was, too: They were both light-skinned enough to
pass, so the two grandmothers, well before my parents were born, would
go together to white suffrage conferences in the South, and then come
back and share the information they learned with the Black community.

But even before I knew the details of my family’s story, voting and
political involvement were very much a part of my growing up. One of my
first memories is of my hand reaching up for my mother’s as she walked
with me to the New York Public Library, down through this back labyrinth
to where the voting booths were. I always knew that this was something
very precious, and not to be taken for granted.

jobs — my grandmother Nora was the first woman in the country to get a

were civically active all the time. Nobody sat me down and told me about
Elizabeth or Harriot: I learned vicariously through these two powerful

If you want to know about democracy, and the tools of democracy, then
learn about the suffrage movement. This was warfare, and the suffragists
used every single weapon available: petitions, lobbying, newspapers,
speeches, marches — everything except the gun. That’s why it’s called
the world’s greatest bloodless revolution. These women worked their full
lifetimes, and then the next generation did the same, and the next. I’m
very proud to be the daughter of the daughter of the daughter of the
daughter. People talk about the mitochondrial DNA that passes down
through the mother. That’s the powerhouse within the cell. And I’m proud
to have that power boost.

My grandmother Alfreda was very purposeful when I was growing up about
making sure we knew who her mother was, and passing down her values,
while also not putting pressure on us to live up to anybody else’s
legacy. People underestimate how much pressure there is for children
dealing with a parent who’s such a public figure, and I think that’s why
my grandmother was so determined that we would have our own identities.

At the same time, she was relentless about making sure Ida was not
forgotten. She was the one who found the manuscript for her mother’s
incomplete autobiography. She was a widow raising five children on her
own, and she would stay up working on it when the kids were asleep. She
managed to get it
[published](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo49856620.html)
in 1970. We now have four generations of my family that have created or
supported some kind of [work around Ida’s
legacy](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ida-B-the-Queen/Michelle-Duster/9781982129811),
and it all started with my grandmother.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I can only imagine that Ida might be slightly disappointed if she saw
where we are now. She spent over 50 years fighting for equality and
justice, and here we are, almost 90 years after she died, still
fighting. We still haven’t reached the point where there is true racial
and economic and gender equality in this country. Then again, maybe she
wouldn’t be surprised, because she knew that social change takes a long
time.

Most of what I know about Mary came from reading books written by others
and from reading things she wrote herself. She was a woman who would go
all over, selling her newspaper (the first to be published by a Black
woman in North America) and sharing ideas of freedom and liberty. I’ve
been just fascinated by her and her life and how feisty she was and the
things she was able to accomplish at a time when women were not being
heard.

In 1998, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame in
Seneca Falls, N.Y. I went to the ceremony with my cousin Dorothy Shadd
Shreve. The evening before, we were all given candles and lined up, 10
abreast, to march down the main road to the hall. Dorothy was in her
90s, but there she was, in her high heels, walking very forcefully down
the street. As we marched arm-in-arm with all these remarkable women,
the people from the town lined up on both sides of the street and
applauded. I remember Dorothy saying, “And we’re still fighting for the
rights of women\!” I’ll never forget that experience.

My father died when I was 2 years old, so I grew up not knowing a lot
about the Ewing family. But at a family reunion about 25 years ago, I
kept hearing about Prince Albert Ewing and Isabella, my
great-great-grandparents. It was a surprise to me to hear about people
who I’m related to, who lived in the city where I’ve always lived and
who were so involved in the Nashville African-American community.

This was before the days of online genealogy, so I did the old-fashioned
work of going to courthouses and libraries to discover more information.
They were both enslaved, Prince Albert at a place called [Travellers
Rest](https://historictravellersrest.org/) and Isabella at the
[Hermitage](https://thehermitage.com/). They were married in 1871 and
purchased some land near the Hermitage, where they built a house. That’s
where I found their voting cards. Prince Albert was a magistrate in the
1880s. He was elected three times. But Isabella couldn’t vote for him.
So it was very important, even though he was no longer on the bench,
that she went to register as soon as she could.

There’s all this talk that women were “given” the right to vote. Women
were not given the right to vote: They fought for the right to vote.
They organized for the right to vote. They demanded the right to vote.
This didn’t happen by magic. They really had to fight for it.

My grandmother was quite a gal. She was one of the first women to
graduate from Nashua High School, and she had a career as a secretary at
the Nashua Card, Gummed and Coated Paper Company (later known as the
Nashua Corporation) before she married at 32. She was unique and
progressive for her time, very independent. And my grandfather was very
supportive. Both of my grandparents stood up for what they believed in.

He died before I was born, and she died when I was about 13. My
grandmother never really talked to me about women’s rights in much
detail because I was so young. But I’ve been very active politically, so
it must be in the blood. Speaking out seems to run in the family, and
the women are quite strong. We don’t sit back. We’re not passive. And
Delia wasn’t either.

My brother and I were brought up telling Maggie Walker’s story, and it’s
a responsibility I take very seriously. But the family narrative I grew
up telling was focused on the work she did as the first African-American
woman to charter a bank in the United States. It wasn’t until recently,
as part of my work campaigning in Virginia for the [Equal Rights
Amendment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/us/era-virginia-vote.html),
that I really learned about her involvement in the political field.
Knowing her, though, it didn’t come as a surprise: In everything she
did, her focus was on empowering her community.

She was not necessarily out and marching — Maggie was partially disabled
because of diabetes — but she organized. When women did get the right to
vote, she made sure it wasn’t just for white women: She registered
hundreds of Black women to vote that first year. She and other
contemporaries also formed a [“Lily Black”
ticket](https://digitalsc.lib.vt.edu/exhibits/show/womens-history-2016/item/4697),
in response to the “lily white” ticket in the Republican Party, and in
1921 she became the first Black woman to run for statewide office in
Virginia.

This 100th anniversary is coming at a pivotal time. We’re seeing the
call for Black voices to be highlighted in this country, where they’ve
been silenced for so long. It’s so important for young Black women to
have somebody like Maggie to look up to, and being able to use my voice
to share her story is a huge honor.

I was 7 when Mary passed away, so I remember her just as great-grandma.
She had a corner store where we would hang out when I was a kid, and she
would read our palms. I always kind of knew what she did — we all knew
she was the first woman legislator in Wyoming and that she had worked
hard in the Democratic Party for suffrage — but it wasn’t until fairly
recently that I spent more time researching her accomplishments.

The history of political movements is forgotten pretty rapidly after
things are changed one way or the other — how the movement went forward,
how long sometimes it takes to change a social norm and what needs to be
done to get actual change accomplished. What we learn from the
suffragists is how hard people worked to get something done for future
generations because they believed it was truly the right thing to do. My
great-grandma taught a kind of Jeffersonian attitude: You do what you
can do for society with the gifts you’re given. That was how she looked
at life, and that’s what she
did.
