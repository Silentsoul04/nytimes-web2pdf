<div class="css-53u6y8">

The New York-based aesthetician [Isabelle
Bellis](https://isabellebellis.com/), who is accustomed to using her
hands for much of the day — lifting, sculpting and massaging the facial
muscles of her clients — has felt a noticeable loss lately. Since
deciding to permanently close her Manhattan studio after the pandemic
hit, Bellis has turned to gardening, at her home in rural Connecticut,
as a way to keep her fingers nimble and active — and, she says, to “fill
the void.”

But to lend support to her regulars, who miss her healing touch, and to
anyone else looking to clear pores, de-puff under-eye bags and calm
inflammation, she and many other facialists who are physically distant
from their clients have also been dispensing at-home care tips. The Los
Angeles-based aesthetician [Joomee Song](https://faceworksinc.com/), for
example, has been fielding emails and sending out curated care packages
of skin products while [Elaine Ng
Huntzinger](https://linktr.ee/elainehuntzinger) has teleconferenced with
clients to offer pointers on gua sha — the ancient Chinese facial toning
practice — from her Paris apartment. Much can be done remotely, the
experts say: Masks and creams can impart treatment-like benefits and
high-tech tools can substitute, when necessary, for a professional’s
deft **** hands. Here, **** four **** quick but effective facials to
incorporate into your routine, **** to brighten, lift and revitalize
your complexion.

### <span>**Brightening and Smoothing**</span>

While exfoliating gently each day, or even once a week, can work
wonders, sometimes a deeper cleanse is called for — especially in
summer, when sweat and sunscreen can lead to buildup and a dull, uneven
complexion. For a facial that will counteract this effect, Song
recommends beginning by **** lightly sweeping a gauze pad saturated in a
pore-refining toner, such as Circumference’s [Active Botanical Refining
Toner](https://www.circumferencenyc.com/collections/shop-skincare/products/active-botanical-refining-toner),
$60, over the face. For a more powerful remedy, buff with a dermaplaning
tool — Dermaflash’s
[One](https://dermaflash.com/products/one-device?variant=32635171045516),
$139, has a vibrating edge that lightly removes the top layer **** of
skin. Then, apply a potent brightening serum, such as Klur’s [Brilliant
Light](https://klur.co/collections/shop/products/brilliant-light), $80,
which contains ferulic acid and vitamins C and E, ingredients that work
in harmony to reduce dark spots. To speed absorption when applying any
serum, Huntzinger **** recommends rubbing it between your fingers for a
few seconds, then tapping it into your skin. “Next, I make fast,
brush-like motions from my jawline to my cheekbones,” she says. “With my
fingers, I lightly pat around my eyes, and finish by pressing my face
with my whole hand, making sure the serum has fully penetrated.”
Finally, slather on a moisturizer with sunscreen to prevent any
discoloration from returning.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Hydrating and Healing**</span>

Facialists typically **** rely on multiple products — including mists,
essences and concentrates — to give skin a fresh, plumped appearance. If
you don’t have the patience (or budget) for quite so many layers but
want to achieve a dewy look, **** start by finding a single,
high-quality serum that contains hyaluronic acid — a humectant that
pulls in moisture like a sponge. Bynacht’s [Hypercharged Glass Skin
Serum](https://shen-beauty.com/collections/bynacht/products/hypercharged-glass-skin-serum),
$320, is made with a blend of eight hyaluronic acids — of varying
molecular weights — to ensure it reaches the skin’s deepest layers (a
more affordable option is L’Oréal Paris’s [1.9% Pure Hyaluronic Acid 7
Replumping
Ampoules](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/skin-care/products/face-serums/revitalift-derm-intensives-1-9-pure-hyaluronic-acid-7-replumping-ampoules.aspx?shade=revitalift-derm-intensives-1-9-pure-hyaluronic-acid-7-replumping-ampoules),
$25). Apply the serum with a gentle touch — starting at the center of
the face and then moving out to the sides and up to the temples — for a
relaxing massage, says Song. Follow with a creamy mask, such as Epara’s
[Intense Hydrating
Mask](https://www.eparaskincare.com/products/intense-hydrating-mask),
£105 (about $133), or a sheet mask: 111Skin’s [Y Theorem Bio Cellulose
Facial
Mask](https://111skin.com/collections/face-masks/products/y-theorem-bio-cellulose-facial-mask?variant=31977084715093),
$32, delivers softening amino acids into the skin via a bio-cellulose
film.

### <span>**Calming and Sculpting**</span>

Manual lymphatic drainage massage helps remove excess fluid (lymph) in
the body with carefully choreographed motions that can be difficult for
a novice to master at home. A more accessible technique is gua sha, says
Huntzinger, which involves gliding a stone tool (she likes the versions
by [Lanshin](https://shop.lanshin.com/collections/gua-sha-tools-1)) over
your face to boost circulation and release muscle tension. Start by
applying a mist, oil or serum so the stone has some slip (try Rose
Ingleton MD’s [Skin Calming
Booster](https://www.rosemdskin.com/collections/frontpage/products/rose-skin-calming-booster),
$70). Position the notched edge of the tool at the center of your chin,
keeping the stone flat against the skin. Lightly drag the stone along
your jawline, moving it up to your right ear. Repeat this five times,
then do the same on the other side of your jaw, moving the stone up to
your left ear. Continue this process by working in zones: across the
cheeks, under the eyes, and forehead, always beginning in the center of
the face, and moving upward to the sides. Another option, says the
Dallas-based facialist Joanna Czech, is a toning microcurrent device,
such as the NuFace
[Trinity](https://www.joannaczech.com/products/nuface-trinity-facial-toning-device?_pos=3&_sid=88913c290&_ss=r),
$325, which zaps muscles with (mostly painless) pulsating electrical
currents for a noticeable lift. Follow with a toning serum — Czech
swears by Biologique Recherche’s [Serum VG
Tensil](https://www.joannaczech.com/products/serum-vg-tensil), $72 — and
a firming cream, such as Estée Lauder’s [Revitalizing Supreme+ Global
Anti-Aging Cell Power
Crème](https://www.esteelauder.com/product/681/42475/product-catalog/skincare/revitalizing-supreme/global-anti-aging-cell-power-creme),
$87.

### <span>**Decongesting and Clarifying**</span>

Now that **** many of us are homebound, Bellis says, there’s an
opportunity to “liberate one’s skin from the pore-clogging effects of
daily makeup.” To further clear the complexion, Bellis recommends
beginning with a double cleanse: Lather on an emollient balm to dissolve
debris, then an alpha-hydroxy wash to eliminate excess oil (try
Holifrog’s [Kissimmee Vitamin F Therapy Balmy
Wash](https://holifrog.com/collections/holiwashes/products/kissimmee-vitamin-f-therapy-balmy-wash),
$42, and [Shasta AHA Refining Acid
Wash](https://holifrog.com/collections/holiwashes/products/shasta),
$38). From there, minimize acne-causing bacteria with a blue-light
therapy device — Huntzinger is a fan of Foreo’s
[Espada](https://www.foreo.com/espada), $134 — or consider **** a
pore-refining clay mask, such as Aesop’s [Chamomile Concentrate
Anti-Blemish
Masque](https://www.aesop.com/us/p/skin/treat-masque/chamomile-concentrate-anti-blemish-masque/),
$45, followed by a non-greasy moisturizer (try Shani Darden’s
[Weightless Oil-Free
Moisturizer](https://www.shanidarden.com/collections/shani-darden/products/shani-darden-daily-oil-free-moisturizer),
$48). Bellis likes to finish by applying a cold compress made from a
chilled herbal tea blend of calendula, chamomile, rose hips and fresh
mint, which, she says, contains antihistamines that **** reduce
swelling. “And make enough so you have a cup to drink,” she adds: a
facial should be relaxing whether the setting is a spa or your living
room — and **** hydrating will only give your skin an added boost.
