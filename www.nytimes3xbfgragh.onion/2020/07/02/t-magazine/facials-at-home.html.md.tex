The New York-based aesthetician
\href{https://isabellebellis.com/}{Isabelle Bellis}, who is accustomed
to using her hands for much of the day --- lifting, sculpting and
massaging the facial muscles of her clients --- has felt a noticeable
loss lately. Since deciding to permanently close her Manhattan studio
after the pandemic hit, Bellis has turned to gardening, at her home in
rural Connecticut, as a way to keep her fingers nimble and active ---
and, she says, to ``fill the void.''

But to lend support to her regulars, who miss her healing touch, and to
anyone else looking to clear pores, de-puff under-eye bags and calm
inflammation, she and many other facialists who are physically distant
from their clients have also been dispensing at-home care tips. The Los
Angeles-based aesthetician \href{https://faceworksinc.com/}{Joomee
Song}, for example, has been fielding emails and sending out curated
care packages of skin products while
\href{https://linktr.ee/elainehuntzinger}{Elaine Ng Huntzinger} has
teleconferenced with clients to offer pointers on gua sha --- the
ancient Chinese facial toning practice --- from her Paris apartment.
Much can be done remotely, the experts say: Masks and creams can impart
treatment-like benefits and high-tech tools can substitute, when
necessary, for a professional's deft **** hands. Here, **** four ****
quick but effective facials to incorporate into your routine, **** to
brighten, lift and revitalize your complexion.

\hypertarget{brightening-and-smoothing}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Brightening and
Smoothing}}{Brightening and Smoothing}}\label{brightening-and-smoothing}}

While exfoliating gently each day, or even once a week, can work
wonders, sometimes a deeper cleanse is called for --- especially in
summer, when sweat and sunscreen can lead to buildup and a dull, uneven
complexion. For a facial that will counteract this effect, Song
recommends beginning by **** lightly sweeping a gauze pad saturated in a
pore-refining toner, such as Circumference's
\href{https://www.circumferencenyc.com/collections/shop-skincare/products/active-botanical-refining-toner}{Active
Botanical Refining Toner}, \$60, over the face. For a more powerful
remedy, buff with a dermaplaning tool --- Dermaflash's
\href{https://dermaflash.com/products/one-device?variant=32635171045516}{One},
\$139, has a vibrating edge that lightly removes the top layer **** of
skin. Then, apply a potent brightening serum, such as Klur's
\href{https://klur.co/collections/shop/products/brilliant-light}{Brilliant
Light}, \$80, which contains ferulic acid and vitamins C and E,
ingredients that work in harmony to reduce dark spots. To speed
absorption when applying any serum, Huntzinger **** recommends rubbing
it between your fingers for a few seconds, then tapping it into your
skin. ``Next, I make fast, brush-like motions from my jawline to my
cheekbones,'' she says. ``With my fingers, I lightly pat around my eyes,
and finish by pressing my face with my whole hand, making sure the serum
has fully penetrated.'' Finally, slather on a moisturizer with sunscreen
to prevent any discoloration from returning.

\hypertarget{hydrating-and-healing}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Hydrating and
Healing}}{Hydrating and Healing}}\label{hydrating-and-healing}}

Facialists typically **** rely on multiple products --- including mists,
essences and concentrates --- to give skin a fresh, plumped appearance.
If you don't have the patience (or budget) for quite so many layers but
want to achieve a dewy look, **** start by finding a single,
high-quality serum that contains hyaluronic acid --- a humectant that
pulls in moisture like a sponge. Bynacht's
\href{https://shen-beauty.com/collections/bynacht/products/hypercharged-glass-skin-serum}{Hypercharged
Glass Skin Serum}, \$320, is made with a blend of eight hyaluronic acids
--- of varying molecular weights --- to ensure it reaches the skin's
deepest layers (a more affordable option is L'Oréal Paris's
\href{https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/skin-care/products/face-serums/revitalift-derm-intensives-1-9-pure-hyaluronic-acid-7-replumping-ampoules.aspx?shade=revitalift-derm-intensives-1-9-pure-hyaluronic-acid-7-replumping-ampoules}{1.9\%
Pure Hyaluronic Acid 7 Replumping Ampoules}, \$25). Apply the serum with
a gentle touch --- starting at the center of the face and then moving
out to the sides and up to the temples --- for a relaxing massage, says
Song. Follow with a creamy mask, such as Epara's
\href{https://www.eparaskincare.com/products/intense-hydrating-mask}{Intense
Hydrating Mask}, £105 (about \$133), or a sheet mask: 111Skin's
\href{https://111skin.com/collections/face-masks/products/y-theorem-bio-cellulose-facial-mask?variant=31977084715093}{Y
Theorem Bio Cellulose Facial Mask}, \$32, delivers softening amino acids
into the skin via a bio-cellulose film.

\hypertarget{calming-and-sculpting}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Calming and
Sculpting}}{Calming and Sculpting}}\label{calming-and-sculpting}}

Manual lymphatic drainage massage helps remove excess fluid (lymph) in
the body with carefully choreographed motions that can be difficult for
a novice to master at home. A more accessible technique is gua sha, says
Huntzinger, which involves gliding a stone tool (she likes the versions
by \href{https://shop.lanshin.com/collections/gua-sha-tools-1}{Lanshin})
over your face to boost circulation and release muscle tension. Start by
applying a mist, oil or serum so the stone has some slip (try Rose
Ingleton MD's
\href{https://www.rosemdskin.com/collections/frontpage/products/rose-skin-calming-booster}{Skin
Calming Booster}, \$70). Position the notched edge of the tool at the
center of your chin, keeping the stone flat against the skin. Lightly
drag the stone along your jawline, moving it up to your right ear.
Repeat this five times, then do the same on the other side of your jaw,
moving the stone up to your left ear. Continue this process by working
in zones: across the cheeks, under the eyes, and forehead, always
beginning in the center of the face, and moving upward to the sides.
Another option, says the Dallas-based facialist Joanna Czech, is a
toning microcurrent device, such as the NuFace
\href{https://www.joannaczech.com/products/nuface-trinity-facial-toning-device?_pos=3\&_sid=88913c290\&_ss=r}{Trinity},
\$325, which zaps muscles with (mostly painless) pulsating electrical
currents for a noticeable lift. Follow with a toning serum --- Czech
swears by Biologique Recherche's
\href{https://www.joannaczech.com/products/serum-vg-tensil}{Serum VG
Tensil}, \$72 --- and a firming cream, such as Estée Lauder's
\href{https://www.esteelauder.com/product/681/42475/product-catalog/skincare/revitalizing-supreme/global-anti-aging-cell-power-creme}{Revitalizing
Supreme+ Global Anti-Aging Cell Power Crème}, \$87.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Decongesting and
Clarifying}}{Decongesting and Clarifying}}\label{decongesting-and-clarifying}}

Now that **** many of us are homebound, Bellis says, there's an
opportunity to ``liberate one's skin from the pore-clogging effects of
daily makeup.'' To further clear the complexion, Bellis recommends
beginning with a double cleanse: Lather on an emollient balm to dissolve
debris, then an alpha-hydroxy wash to eliminate excess oil (try
Holifrog's
\href{https://holifrog.com/collections/holiwashes/products/kissimmee-vitamin-f-therapy-balmy-wash}{Kissimmee
Vitamin F Therapy Balmy Wash}, \$42, and
\href{https://holifrog.com/collections/holiwashes/products/shasta}{Shasta
AHA Refining Acid Wash}, \$38). From there, minimize acne-causing
bacteria with a blue-light therapy device --- Huntzinger is a fan of
Foreo's \href{https://www.foreo.com/espada}{Espada}, \$134 --- or
consider **** a pore-refining clay mask, such as Aesop's
\href{https://www.aesop.com/us/p/skin/treat-masque/chamomile-concentrate-anti-blemish-masque/}{Chamomile
Concentrate Anti-Blemish Masque}, \$45, followed by a non-greasy
moisturizer (try Shani Darden's
\href{https://www.shanidarden.com/collections/shani-darden/products/shani-darden-daily-oil-free-moisturizer}{Weightless
Oil-Free Moisturizer}, \$48). Bellis likes to finish by applying a cold
compress made from a chilled herbal tea blend of calendula, chamomile,
rose hips and fresh mint, which, she says, contains antihistamines that
**** reduce swelling. ``And make enough so you have a cup to drink,''
she adds: a facial should be relaxing whether the setting is a spa or
your living room --- and **** hydrating will only give your skin an
added boost.
