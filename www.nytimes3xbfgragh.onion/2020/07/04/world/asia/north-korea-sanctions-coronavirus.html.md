SEOUL, South Korea — On New Year’s Day, [North
Korea](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/world/asia/north-korea-floods-coronavirus.html)’s
leader, Kim Jong-un, called for a “frontal breakthrough to foil the
enemies’ sanctions.” The strategy meant finding new sources of income,
legal or illegal, and mainly from China.

Sending North Korean workers to China. Bringing more tourists from
there. Smuggling banned cargo, like coal or oil, [across the border at
night](http://vod.kbs.co.kr/index.html?source=episode&sname=vod&stype=vod&program_code=T2011-1097&program_id=PS-2019197532-01-000&section_code=05&broadcast_complete_yn=N&local_station_code=00&section_sub_code=06)
or between ships[on high
seas.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/18/world/asia/north-korea-oil-smuggling.html)

But there was one thing Mr. Kim did not foresee: the coronavirus.

Barely three weeks after Mr. Kim unveiled his New Year’s resolution,
[North Korea shut down ​its
border](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html)
with China to protect itself against the emerging outbreak in the city
of Wuhan. It was no ordinary border​ closure.

China accounted for 95 percent of the North’s trade. Consumer goods, raw
materials, fuel and machine parts smuggled into the North across their
870-mile border kept North Korean markets and factories sputtering
along, despite United Nations sanctions designed to curb the Kim
regime’s nuclear ambitions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With the border sealed, the North’s official exports to China, already
hobbled by the sanctions, have crashed even further. In March, they were
worth just $610,000, according to Chinese customs data — down 96 percent
from a year earlier. The North’s [newly opened ski and spa
resorts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/03/world/asia/north-korea-resorts-sanctions.html)are
empty of Chinese tourists, and its smuggling ships [sit idle in their

The virus has isolated the North Korean economy as no sanctions could.
It has devastated the regime’s ability to bring in money through legal
and illegal trade, leaving it scrambling to protect the country’s
diminishing foreign currency reserves.

“To North Korea, Covid-19 is a black swan, none of its policymakers saw
it coming,” said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for
Policy Studies in Seoul.

​North Korea [claims it has had no coronavirus
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html).
But it was one of the first countries to shut its border, aware that its
woefully underequipped public health system made it particularly
vulnerable to mass infection.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The pandemic could hardly have come at a worse time for Mr. Kim, whose
attempts to win sanctions relief in talks with President Trump have been
fruitless. North Korea’s recent acts of hostility toward South Korea,
including [the destruction of the inter-Korean liaison office in the
North,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/world/asia/north-korea-explosion-liaison-office.html)have
been seen in part as acts of economic
desperation.

“If you peel North Korea’s problem like an onion, at the core is its
economy, and its economic trouble comes down to whether it can lift

Seoul.

The North Korean economy has languished for decades, hobbled by
communist mismanagement, a famine in the late 1990s and the gradually
tougher sanctions imposed by the United Nations since 2006, when the
North carried out its first nuclear test.

Mr. Kim has tried to boost the economy with domestic reforms, aimed at
creating a “socialist system of responsible business operation.”
Factories and collective farms were given more incentives to increase
productivity, including the right to keep surpluses.

Mr. Kim also ramped up exports of coal, iron ore, textiles and seafood
to China, achieving economic growth of 3.9 percent in 2016, the highest
since the late 1990s, according to South Korea’s central bank.

But the North also rapidly expanded ​its weapons ​programs,
testing[three intercontinental ballistic
missiles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/30/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test.html)
in 2017, as well as what it said was [a hydrogen
bomb](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/03/world/asia/north-korea-tremor-possible-6th-nuclear-test.html).
In response, the United Nations Security Council tightened the noose
around the North’s economy by banning all of its major exports.​

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 2017. It contracted by 4.1 percent
the following year, with its exports to China plummeting 86 percent.

By February 2019, when Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump held their second summit
meeting, in Vietnam, the North Korean leader was desperate ​for relief​.
The Security Council had required China, Russia and other countries to
expel all [North Korean
workers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/02/20/world/asia/north-koreans-toil-in-slavelike-conditions-abroad-rights-groups-say.html)
by ​December, which threatened to deprive the North of another key
source of income, estimated at $500 million to $1 billion a year.

But Mr. Kim’s hopes of easing the sanctions ended when the Vietnam talks
collapsed.

In his ​grim New Year’s message​, Mr. Kim seemed determined to slog
through the sanctions, asking North Koreans to prepare to “tighten our
belts” again. He also vowed to boost his nuclear weapons program
further, hoping that a more advanced nuclear arsenal would give him more
leverage with Mr. Trump or his successor. He [threatened to end his
moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile
tests,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/31/world/asia/north-korea-kim-speech.html)
warning that ​the world would soon witness ​his “new strategic weapon​.”

State-run television echoed that sentiment later in January, in a
broadcast about Mr. Kim’s [brief meeting with Mr. Trump last
summer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/30/world/asia/trump-north-korea-dmz.html)
on the inter-Korean border. “We don’t intend to sell our pride and
national power for some spectacular economic transformation,” Mr. Kim
was quoted as telling Mr. Trump, after the American leader promised the
North a better economic future if it gave up its nuclear weapons first.

At the time, Mr. Kim had reason to be so defiant.

After hitting bottom in 2018, his country’s trade with China grew 15
percent last year, according to data compiled by the Korea International
Trade Association. It exported practically anything not banned by United
Nations sanctions: cheap watches assembled with Chinese components;
artificial eyelashes; wigs, mannequins, soccer balls and tungsten.

China also sent more tourists to the North after Mr. Kim’s third summit
meeting with its leader, Xi Jinping, in June 2018. Tourism was one North
Korean industry that had not been affected by the sanctions, and Mr. Kim
has been [busy building massive new resort

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The North also continued to circumvent the sanctions. Last year, it
[exported $370 million worth of
coal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-sanctions-un-exclusive/exclusive-north-korea-enhanced-nuclear-missile-programs-in-2019-in-breach-of-sanctions-u-n-report-idUSKBN20426J)
in illicit ship-to-ship transfers to Chinese barges, according to the
United Nations. And despite the ban on work permits for North Koreans,
China allowed many to be employed on short-term tourist or student
visas, according to analysts and news reports​ in South
Korea​.

But the trade imbalance with China created its own concerns.

Even as the sanctions hit the North’s exports hard, the country
continued to buy cooking oil, flour, sugar and other consumer goods, as
well as construction materials, from China. The imports were needed to
keep its industries going, as well as [the unofficial
markets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/30/world/asia/north-korea-economy-marketplace.html)
that have helped many people to survive, as the North’s food rationing
system fails to meet the population’s needs.

Since 2017, North Korea has reported a trade deficit of more than $2
billion every year. In comparison, the North’s total exports last year
were $260 million.​

“The clock is ticking and the bomb could explode any time,” Kim
Byung-yeon, a​ Seoul National University​ economist​,
[wrote](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2019/12/18/columns/Kim-in-a-cage/3071650.html?detailWord=)
in December, predicting that the North’s foreign currency reserves would
shrink by $1 billion a year, leading inexorably to a crisis.

North Korea has tried to replenish its coffers with revenues from
illegal smuggling and

as well as “loyalty donations” from ​what are known as donju —
tradespeople with political connections, who have hoarded foreign
currency obtained through smuggling​ and other enterprises.

Mr. Kim’s government also runs shops in Pyongyang, the capital, where
the moneyed class spends foreign currency on imported goods. And it has
profited by selling Chinese smartphones to an estimated six million
cellphone subscribers in the country.

“The debate has been about how quickly or slowly the North’s foreign
currency would diminish,” Mr. Go said. “But there is no doubt now that
Covid-19 has accelerated the
speed.”

​Recently, signs have emerged of growing stress on the North’s economy,
especially its foreign currency reserves.

The government recently [issued public
bonds](https://www.dailynk.com/english/north-korea-begun-issuing-public-bonds/)
for the first time in 17 years, reported Daily NK, a Seoul-based website
that uses informants inside ​the ​North. Mr. Kim tested the elites’
loyalty by asking them to buy bonds with foreign currency, it said.

The authorities have also cracked down harder on the use of foreign
currency in markets in an effort to shore up the won, the local
currency, said Jiro Ishimaru, a chief editor at [Asia Press
International](http://www.asiapress.org/rimjin-gang/)in Japan, who has
monitored the North Korean economy for years with the help of
correspondents there.

To save on foreign currency, ​Mr. Kim has encouraged his people to
produce more goods at home, like snacks, cosmetics and beverages. But
Covid-19 has hit those sectors as well, because they depended on Chinese
raw materials to produce the goods.

“Kim Jong-un thought he could survive with tourism revenues, smuggling
and Chinese help,​ but his plans have crumbled because of the
coronavirus,” said Mr. Ishimaru​. “If the virus has taught him anything,
it is how dependent his economy is on China.”
