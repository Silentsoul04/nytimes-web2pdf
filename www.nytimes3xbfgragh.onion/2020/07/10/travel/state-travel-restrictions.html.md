*This list will be updated as states continue to announce changes to
their travel advisories. Are we missing an update? Email us at*
[*travelrestrictions@NYTimes.com*](mailto:travelrestrictions@NYTimes.com)*.*

While dog days of summer are winding down in the United States, the
pandemic is still ongoing. Airlines are working to make it easier for
fliers to make and adjust travel plans domestically by eliminating [most
change
fees](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/08/31/business/bc-us-airlines-change-fees.html),
but travelers still face a lot of logistics, with constantly evolving
state restrictions from [mandatory testing to quarantine
requirements](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html). amid the
ongoing pandemic

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that [travel
increases a person’s chance of getting and spreading the
virus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftravelers%2Ftravel-in-the-us.html).
“Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from
Covid-19,” the federal agency cautions.

For those who do take a trip, the C.D.C. says that each mode of
transportation has its own risks, and offers a series of recommendations
for safety: that people wear a face mask in public, wash hands
frequently, avoid touching their face, keep six feet from others, cover
coughs and sneezes, and use drive-through service and curbside pickup at
restaurants and stores.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Here is a summary of current restrictions in the United States for
leisure travelers, although some requirements do not apply to those
spending less than a day in the state. Many states also have exemptions
for essential workers who are on the job, including health care workers,
members of the military and others, but even [they are subject to some
restrictions](https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/covid-19-essential-workers-in-the-states.aspx).

With the number of coronavirus cases surging across the country, check
the areas you plan to visit before you travel. Some municipalities or
counties may have more stringent regulations than issued by their state.

### <span>[Alabama](https://alabama.travel/my-trip/staying-safe)</span>

As of Sept. 1, there were no statewide restrictions in Alabama.

### <span>[Alaska](https://covid19.alaska.gov/travelers/)</span>

All nonresidents must upload proof of a negative or pending virus test
taken within 72 hours before departure to [an online travel
portal](https://www.alaska.covidsecureapp.com/), where they can also
submit a travel declaration and self-isolation plan. The state requests
a second test be done seven to 14 days after arriving in Alaska.

Visitors arriving without a previously taken test can get one for $250,
and must quarantine while awaiting results at their own cost. Testing is
free for Alaska residents, who also have the option of a two-week
quarantine instead of a test.

### <span>[Arizona](https://tourism.az.gov/covid-19-updates-2/)</span>

As of Sept. 1, there were no statewide restrictions in
Arizona.

### <span>[Arkansas](https://www.arkansas.com/travel-advisory/covid-19)</span>

As of Sept. 1, there were no statewide restrictions in
Arkansas.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>[California](https://www.visitcalifornia.com/latest-covid-19-coronavirus)</span>

As of Sept. 1, there were no statewide restrictions in
California.

### <span>[Colorado](https://covid19.colorado.gov/prepare-protect-yourself/prevent-the-spread/travel)</span>

As of Sept. 1, there were no statewide restrictions in
Colorado.

### <span>[Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/Covid-19-Knowledge-Base/Travel-In-or-Out-of-CT)</span>

With rare exceptions, those coming into Connecticut after more than 24
hours in a state or area with a high rate of confirmed infections must
self-quarantine for 14 days from their last contact with the affected
state.

The states currently affected by the order are Alabama, Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia
and Wisconsin. Visitors or residents returning from Guam, Puerto Rico or
the U.S. Virgin Islands face the same restrictions.

Someone whose home state is added to the list after they are already
vacationing in Connecticut is asked to quarantine, but isn’t required
to. People under self-quarantine may leave for medical visits, to obtain
medication or to shop for groceries. A person who cannot quarantine
because they are coming in for a funeral, for instance, may show proof
of negative results for a coronavirus test taken in the previous 72
hours. Those who have been tested but have not received the results are
required to quarantine until negative results are received and submitted
to the
state.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.
