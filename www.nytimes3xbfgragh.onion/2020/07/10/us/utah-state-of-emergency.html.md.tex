Police
Shooting}\label{utah-governor-declares-state-of-emergency-after-protests-over-police-shooting}}

Protests erupted after the district attorney in Salt Lake City said
there would be no charges against the officers involved in the May
shooting of Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal.

Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah declared a state of emergency Thursday in
response to protests in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/salt-lake-city-autism-shooting.html}{Salt
Lake City} that erupted after the authorities said the fatal police
shooting of a 22-year-old man in May was justified.

The Salt Lake County district attorney, Sim Gill, announced on Thursday
that there would be
\href{https://slco.org/district-attorney/press-releases/palacios-carbajal-oici/}{no
criminal charges} against the two Salt Lake City Police Department
officers who shot the man, Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal, on May 23.

After the announcement, protesters who had gathered for weeks in front
of the district attorney's office, part of the nationwide movement
against police violence and racism, marched on 500 S, a major street in
the downtown area. The police said that the protests disrupted traffic
and broke windows, and that officers were sprayed with pepper spray. The
officers tried several times to disperse the protests, the department
said.

\href{https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/07/09/protesters-angry-bernardo/}{The
Salt Lake Tribune reported} that some demonstrators spilled red paint on
the road in front of the district attorney's office and that others
threw bottles at police officers in riot gear. Officers pushed
protesters to the ground and hit them with clubs, and a police car
rammed into a protester's vehicle that was being used as a barricade,
the newspaper reported.

At least one officer was injured and at least two people were arrested,
the Police Department said.

The governor's order, in effect until midnight on Monday, closed the
State Capitol building and its grounds to everyone except for employees
and officers.

The district attorney's announcement and the demonstrations came as
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html?searchResultPosition=12}{the
protests} around the country, following the death of George Floyd in
Minneapolis police custody in May, have called for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/us/what-does-defund-police-mean.html}{funding
cuts},
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/nyregion/police-records-50a.html}{policy
changes and accountability} for the police.

Nathan S. Morris, a lawyer for the family of Mr. Palacios-Carbajal, said
in a statement on Thursday that in deciding not to press charges, Mr.
Gill ``took upon himself the decision to exonerate the officers at the
expense of a fair judicial process, rather than permitting a jury of
Bernardo's peers to decide the fate of the officers.''

Mr. Morris said by telephone on Friday that the family would be filing a
wrongful-death lawsuit.

``As a family, we will not stop in our pursuit of justice for Bernardo
through all means that are available to us,'' he said, reading from the
statement, prepared on behalf of the family.

Mayor Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City said on Thursday that the
district attorney's report provided ``significant
\href{https://twitter.com/slcmayor/status/1281321341975588864}{evidence
of the justifiable actions}'' of the officers, but that it was also
likely to disappoint those who wanted the officers to face charges.

``I know that for some, today's decision does not feel like justice,''
she said in a statement. ``It has become increasingly apparent in our
city and across the nation that there is a difference between what so
many feel is morally correct, and what is considered appropriate and
justified under the law.''

Chief Mike Brown of the Salt Lake City Police Department welcomed the
results of the investigation, saying it provided ``transparency and
accountability.''

In a report to Sheriff Rosie Rivera of Salt Lake County and to Chief
Brown, Mr. Gill recounted the events on
\href{https://slco.org/contentassets/932acae5b89840fb943984301a4d5aad/noreplyslcounty.com_20200709_074341.pdf}{the
night of the shooting}, citing a summary of the investigation by a unit
of the Unified Police Department of Greater Salt Lake, which examines
critical incidents involving the police.

On May 23, just after 2 a.m., Officer Neil Iversen and a partner
responded to a 911 call by a person who reported that a Hispanic man had
entered the caller's hotel room and robbed the caller at gunpoint, the
report said. Shortly afterward, another caller reported that two men had
kicked in the door of their room at the same hotel during an armed
robbery.

When they arrived at the hotel, the officers saw a man, later identified
as Mr. Palacios-Carbajal, searching through bags he was holding. He was
ordered to show his hands, but instead he fled, the report said.

Officer Iversen chased Mr. Palacios-Carbajal across a parking lot,
through an alley, and across a street. As he was running, Mr.
Palacios-Carbajal tripped and fell three times, each time dropping and
retrieving an object, the report said.

The third time he dropped the object, Officer Iversen saw that it was a
gun, and after Mr. Palacios-Carbajal picked it up and ran, Officer
Iversen fired, the report said.

By then a sergeant and another officer, Officer Kevin Fortuna, had
arrived, it said. Officer Fortuna and Officer Iversen later told
investigators that the man had rolled over on his back and raised his
right arm with the gun in his hand, and that the two officers had fired
at him until they believed he was ``no longer a threat,'' the report
said.

The medical examiner's report said he had been shot in his back and
right side 13 to 15 times, the investigators' summary said.

The officers' body cameras corroborated their statement that they had
shouted ``drop it'' multiple times and that they believed Mr.
Palacios-Carbajal could shoot at them at any time, the report said. The
report said investigators had concluded the officers' actions satisfied
state law that ``justifies use of deadly force.''
