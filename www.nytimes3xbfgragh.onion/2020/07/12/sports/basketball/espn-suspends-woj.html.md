ESPN’s most prominent basketball reporter has been suspended for a
two-word vulgar email reply to the office of a United States senator on
Friday morning in response to the senator’s critical statements about
the N.B.A.’s relationship with China.

The reporter, Adrian Wojnarowski, sent the email to the office of Josh
Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, who posted a screenshot of
it [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1281604989593559040).

The suspension, which was confirmed by someone close to Wojnarowski,
means he will not be traveling this week to report on the N.B.A.’s
resumed season at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney
World in Florida. On a [recent podcast
episode](http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=29399672), Wojnarowski
said he had sent a number of packages to the Orlando area in advance of
his planned arrival on Sunday.

Hours after sending the email, Wojnarowski
[apologized](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1281650976319868930),
saying he was “disrespectful” and “made a regrettable mistake.” ESPN
[called](https://twitter.com/ESPNPR/status/1281651168406654978) his
email “inexcusable” and said it would address it with him internally. A
spokesman declined to comment on the suspension.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Washington Post
[reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/12/adrian-wojnarowski-suspended-espn-email-senator-josh-hawley/)
the suspension would be from one to two weeks.

Wojnarowski was responding to an email sent by Hawley’s press office to
a number of journalists, criticizing the N.B.A. for “kowtowing to
Beijing” and its decision to allow players to [wear social justice
messages on their
jerseys](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29430249/equality-tops-list-nba-players-most-popular-social-justice-jersey-messages)
during the coming restart of the N.B.A. season in Florida.

The list of acceptable messages, which was agreed to by the N.B.A. and
the union representing the players, includes “Black Lives Matter” and “I
Can’t Breathe.” None reference last year’s widespread protests in Hong
Kong or [China’s increasing
grip](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/world/asia/hong-kong-students-protests-china.html)
on the city.

The matter called into question Wojnarowski’s distance from a league he
covers and appeared to be defending. Hawley has been known to
selectively criticize the N.B.A.’s relationship with China.

The N.B.A. has been a frequent target for many Republicans since the
[league’s rift with
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/06/sports/daryl-morey-rockets-china.html)
began before the season started. Several castigated the N.B.A. —
accusing the league of not firmly standing behind Daryl Morey, the
Houston Rockets’ general manager, who posted an image on Twitter that
was supportive of the pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters in October.
This [incensed the Chinese
government](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/17/sports/basketball/nba-china-adam-silver.html),
which has since limited its business with the N.B.A.

Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, even called for the N.B.A.
commissioner, Adam Silver, to [testify on the
subject](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/10/13/in-hong-kong-cruz-decries-china-dictatorship-blasts-nba-for-censoring-houston-rockets-gm/).
When prominent and frequently outspoken league figures like Steve Kerr,
LeBron James and James Harden were asked about Morey’s comments, they
either demurred or [declined to support
Morey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/sports/basketball/lebron-james-china.html).

When it comes to the leader of their own party, President Trump,
Republicans have mostly been silent, including after Trump [said to
Axios](https://t.co/465G1hhrEf?amp=1) that he wanted to avoid punishing
China for its mass internment of ethnic
[Uighurs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-court.html)
last year because of ongoing trade talks. Trump has also spoken warmly
about President Xi Jinping of China, referring to him as “a friend of
mine” and “an incredible guy,” and urged the country to [investigate the
Bidens](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/03/us/politics/trump-china-bidens.html).

After Wojnarowski’s tweet, conservative critics like the sports blogger
Clay Travis pounced. Travis [sarcastically
tweeted](https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/1281623169678422016)
about ESPN’s “left-wing bias,” and Hawley reshared that tweet with his
followers. Travis’s site, Outkick, later was first to report about
Wojnarowski’s suspension.

For years, conservative critics, and often some competitors, have
[accused
ESPN](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/01/sports/espn-layoffs-sports-politics-bias.html)
of liberal bias and claimed, with little evidence, that it has resulted
in lower ratings. Still, Jimmy Pitaro, who became ESPN’s president in
2018, has sought to steer the network in a direction that focuses more
on what happens on the field. In the last few months, that position has
been challenged, as there have been few sports to cover because of the
coronavirus pandemic and as athletes have spoken out about racism in the
wake of the killing of George Floyd in police custody.
