Adrian Wojnarowski, who is known for his ``Woj bombs'' of breaking news,
emailed a different kind to a U.S. senator.

ESPN's most prominent basketball reporter has been suspended for a
two-word vulgar email reply to the office of a United States senator on
Friday morning in response to the senator's critical statements about
the N.B.A.'s relationship with China.

The reporter, Adrian Wojnarowski, sent the email to the office of Josh
Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, who posted a screenshot of
it \href{https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1281604989593559040}{on
Twitter}.

The suspension, which was confirmed by someone close to Wojnarowski,
means he will not be traveling this week to report on the N.B.A.'s
resumed season at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney
World in Florida. On a
\href{http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=29399672}{recent podcast
episode}, Wojnarowski said he had sent a number of packages to the
Orlando area in advance of his planned arrival on Sunday.

Hours after sending the email, Wojnarowski
\href{https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1281650976319868930}{apologized},
saying he was ``disrespectful'' and ``made a regrettable mistake.'' ESPN
\href{https://twitter.com/ESPNPR/status/1281651168406654978}{called} his
email ``inexcusable'' and said it would address it with him internally.
A spokesman declined to comment on the suspension.

The Washington Post
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/12/adrian-wojnarowski-suspended-espn-email-senator-josh-hawley/}{reported}
the suspension would be from one to two weeks.

Wojnarowski was responding to an email sent by Hawley's press office to
a number of journalists, criticizing the N.B.A. for ``kowtowing to
Beijing'' and its decision to allow players to
\href{https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29430249/equality-tops-list-nba-players-most-popular-social-justice-jersey-messages}{wear
social justice messages on their jerseys} during the coming restart of
the N.B.A. season in Florida.

The list of acceptable messages, which was agreed to by the N.B.A. and
the union representing the players, includes ``Black Lives Matter'' and
``I Can't Breathe.'' None reference last year's widespread protests in
Hong Kong or
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/world/asia/hong-kong-students-protests-china.html}{China's
increasing grip} on the city.

The matter called into question Wojnarowski's distance from a league he
covers and appeared to be defending. Hawley has been known to
selectively criticize the N.B.A.'s relationship with China.

The N.B.A. has been a frequent target for many Republicans since the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/06/sports/daryl-morey-rockets-china.html}{league's
rift with China} began before the season started. Several castigated the
N.B.A. --- accusing the league of not firmly standing behind Daryl
Morey, the Houston Rockets' general manager, who posted an image on
Twitter that was supportive of the pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters in
October. This
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/17/sports/basketball/nba-china-adam-silver.html}{incensed
the Chinese government}, which has since limited its business with the
N.B.A.

Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, even called for the N.B.A.
commissioner, Adam Silver, to
\href{https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/10/13/in-hong-kong-cruz-decries-china-dictatorship-blasts-nba-for-censoring-houston-rockets-gm/}{testify
on the subject}. When prominent and frequently outspoken league figures
like Steve Kerr, LeBron James and James Harden were asked about Morey's
comments, they either demurred or
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/sports/basketball/lebron-james-china.html}{declined
to support Morey}.

When it comes to the leader of their own party, President Trump,
Republicans have mostly been silent, including after Trump
\href{https://t.co/465G1hhrEf?amp=1}{said to Axios} that he wanted to
avoid punishing China for its mass internment of ethnic
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/world/asia/china-xinjiang-uighur-court.html}{Uighurs}
last year because of ongoing trade talks. Trump has also spoken warmly
about President Xi Jinping of China, referring to him as ``a friend of
mine'' and ``an incredible guy,'' and urged the country to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/03/us/politics/trump-china-bidens.html}{investigate
the Bidens}.

After Wojnarowski's tweet, conservative critics like the sports blogger
Clay Travis pounced. Travis
\href{https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/1281623169678422016}{sarcastically
tweeted} about ESPN's ``left-wing bias,'' and Hawley reshared that tweet
with his followers. Travis's site, Outkick, later was first to report
about Wojnarowski's suspension.

For years, conservative critics, and often some competitors, have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/05/01/sports/espn-layoffs-sports-politics-bias.html}{accused
ESPN} of liberal bias and claimed, with little evidence, that it has
resulted in lower ratings. Still, Jimmy Pitaro, who became ESPN's
president in 2018, has sought to steer the network in a direction that
focuses more on what happens on the field. In the last few months, that
position has been challenged, as there have been few sports to cover
because of the coronavirus pandemic and as athletes have spoken out
about racism in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in police
custody.
