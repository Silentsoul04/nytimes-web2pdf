# Texas Hospital Says Man, 30, Died After Attending a ‘Covid Party’

A 30-year-old man who believed the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/texas-coronavirus-rio-grande-valley-starr-county.html)
was a hoax and attended a “[Covid
party](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/arts/music/illegal-parties-coronavirus-europe.html)”
died after being
[infected](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html)
with the virus, according to the chief medical officer at a
[Texas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/texas-coronavirus-rio-grande-valley-starr-county.html)
hospital.

The official, Dr. Jane Appleby of Methodist Hospital in San Antonio,
said the man died after deliberately attending a gathering with an
infected person to test whether the coronavirus was real.

In her statements to news organizations, Dr. Appleby said the man had
told his nurse that he attended a Covid party. Just before he died, she
said the patient told his nurse: “I think I made a mistake. I thought
this was a hoax, but it’s not.”

Health experts and public officials have cast doubt over whether “Covid
parties” are a real phenomenon, and [past reports of such parties have
fallen
apart](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/us/coronavirus-covid-parties.html)
or remained unconfirmed upon closer examination.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Times could not independently verify Dr. Appleby’s account. On
Monday, the San Antonio health department said its contact tracers did
not have any information “that would confirm (or deny)” that such an
event had happened there.

In recent days, the hospital distributed video of Dr. Appleby
[describing the
case](https://abcnews.go.com/US/30-year-man-dies-attending-covid-party-thinking/),
along with a press statement. She did not say when or where the party
took place, how many people attended or how long afterward the man was
hospitalized with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. She
said she was sharing the story to warn others, especially in Texas,
where cases are surging.

The hospital, citing patient confidentiality rules, declined to publicly
identify the man. His family did not respond to several interview
requests passed along through the
hospital.

Asked about skepticism about the story, Laura Breeden, a spokeswoman for
Methodist Healthcare, said, “I was not there; however, Jane Appleby is
our chief medical officer. I believe what she says is true.”

There were 8,332 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the state on
Saturday, according to a [New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html).
Over 258,000 cases and more than 3,200 deaths have been recorded in
Texas so far. At least five people between the ages of 30 and 39 have
died from coronavirus in San Antonio according to [virus-tracking
efforts
there](https://covid19.sanantonio.gov/About-COVID-19/Case-Numbers-Table-Data).

Past reports of “Covid parties” have fallen apart. County health
officials in southeastern Washington State [reported in
May](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/us/coronavirus-covid-parties.html)
that they had evidence that at least two coronavirus cases were linked
to one or more so-called Covid-19 parties, then quickly reversed
themselves, saying that the parties may have been more innocent
gatherings.

In Alabama, [reports that students were
gathering](https://www.wbrc.com/2020/07/03/covid-parties-tuscaloosa-whats-really-going/)
to bet on who could get infected with the virus first — with the
sickened winner taking home a pot of money — [led to warnings from the
University of
Alabama](https://abc3340.com/news/local/university-of-alabama-responds-to-covid-parties-being-thrown-in-tuscaloosa)
to students about the parties’ risks, but state health officials were
unable to confirm the events even happened.

The idea seems to have its origin in a practice from the days before
there was a chickenpox vaccine. Some parents hosted chickenpox parties
to infect their children with the disease, as it was thought to be more
dangerous to contract as an adult.

The vaccine is the safest way to protect against chickenpox now that it
is available, though some, [including former Gov. Matt
Bevin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/21/us/kentucky-governor-chickenpox.html)
of Kentucky, still allowed their children to participate in such
gatherings to contract the illness.

A Covid party would be “dangerous, irresponsible and potentially
deadly,” said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill
Hospital in Manhattan.

“Attending such a party may be a path to an early demise, if not chronic
and unrelenting fatigue, chest pain, difficulty breathing and daily
fevers, if you do survive,” Dr. Glatter said.

The coronavirus does not behave like the chickenpox, he said, and
deliberate infection with either virus is a bad idea.

The United States recently hit a [record

of new Covid-19 cases per day, with over 68,000 confirmed cases on
Friday.

Being infected by the coronavirus has yet to be proved to provide
immunity, so reinfection is still possible.

In an [Op-Ed
article](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/opinion/coronavirus-parties-herd-immunity.html)
for The Times, Dr. Greta Bauer, a professor of epidemiology and
biostatistics, warned against so-called coronavirus parties, noting that
even young people can be hospitalized and face long-term damage from the
virus.

“It is important that we don’t take unnecessary risks with unknown
consequences,” Dr. Bauer wrote. “If we can avoid infection, we need to
do exactly that.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that people infected
with the coronavirus [should not attend
gatherings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html),
and that any event where people are mingling without face coverings or
social distancing is inherently high risk.

A California man [died from Covid-19 after going to a
party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/02/man-who-went-party-warned-people-not-be-an-idiot-like-me-day-before-dying-covid-19/)
— not held for the purpose of infecting its attendees — where people did
not wear masks and an infected person had attended.
