The posthumous debut album by the Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke, who was
shot and killed in February, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album
chart this week, arriving as one of the biggest releases of a slow
summer in the music business, one of countless industries greatly
affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

“Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,” Pop Smoke’s third career release
following two mixtapes, had the largest opening week since [Lady Gaga’s
“Chromatica” in early
June](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/arts/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-billboard.html),
earning the equivalent of 251,000 albums sold, factoring in both
streaming and traditional sales. Songs from the album were streamed 268
million times — the fourth best streaming week of the year — while
[bundles of the music and
merchandise](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/09/business/media/billboard-charts-bundles.html)
helped lead to 59,000 units in sales, according to Nielsen.

Pop Smoke, born Bashar Jackson, was shot and killed during a home
invasion in the Hollywood Hills earlier this year, interrupting his
meteoric mainstream rise from the streets of Canarsie, Brooklyn, where
he was at the forefront of the [bubbling drill
scene](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/arts/music/fivio-foreign-big-drip-brooklyn-drill.html).
Last week, the Los Angeles Police Department [arrested five
men](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/arts/music/pop-smoke-arrests.html)
in connection with the crime.

In the No. 2 spot this week is the original Broadway cast recording of
“Hamilton,” which reached its highest chart placement in its 250th
week on Billboard, surging nearly 300 percent thanks to the July 3
streaming premiere of the [filmed version of the
show](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/movies/hamilton-review-disney-plus.html)
on Disney+. The cast album, released in September 2015, previously
peaked at No. 3 on the chart in 2016, following its 11 wins at that
year’s Tony Awards. This time, songs from “Hamilton” were streamed 90
million times — a record for cast recordings — and the album sold 32,000
units, for a one-week total of 102,000.

The arrival of Pop Smoke and the resurgence of “Hamilton” bumped the
rapper Lil Baby’s “My Turn,” which sat at No. 1 for the last four weeks
in lieu of major new releases, to No. 3 in its 19th week on the chart.
“Blame It on Baby” by DaBaby fell one spot to No. 4, while Post
Malone’s “Hollywood’s Bleeding” landed at No. 5.
