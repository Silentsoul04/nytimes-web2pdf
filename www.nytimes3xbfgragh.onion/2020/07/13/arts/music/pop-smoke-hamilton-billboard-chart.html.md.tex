The posthumous debut album by the Brooklyn rapper Pop Smoke, who was
shot and killed in February, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album
chart this week, arriving as one of the biggest releases of a slow
summer in the music business, one of countless industries greatly
affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

``Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,'' Pop Smoke's third career
release following two mixtapes, had the largest opening week since

Gaga's ``Chromatica'' in early June}, earning the equivalent of 251,000
albums sold, factoring in both streaming and traditional sales. Songs
from the album were streamed 268 million times --- the fourth best
streaming week of the year --- while

of the music and merchandise} helped lead to 59,000 units in sales,
according to Nielsen.

Pop Smoke, born Bashar Jackson, was shot and killed during a home
invasion in the Hollywood Hills earlier this year, interrupting his
meteoric mainstream rise from the streets of Canarsie, Brooklyn, where
he was at the forefront of the

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/arts/music/pop-smoke-arrests.html}{arrested
five men} in connection with the crime.

In the No. 2 spot this week is the original Broadway cast recording of
``Hamilton,'' which reached its highest chart placement in its 250th
week on Billboard, surging nearly 300 percent thanks to the July 3
streaming premiere of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/movies/hamilton-review-disney-plus.html}{filmed
version of the show} on Disney+. The cast album, released in September
2015, previously peaked at No. 3 on the chart in 2016, following its 11
wins at that year's Tony Awards. This time, songs from ``Hamilton'' were
streamed 90 million times --- a record for cast recordings --- and the
album sold 32,000 units, for a one-week total of 102,000.

The arrival of Pop Smoke and the resurgence of ``Hamilton'' bumped the
rapper Lil Baby's ``My Turn,'' which sat at No. 1 for the last four
weeks in lieu of major new releases, to No. 3 in its 19th week on the
chart. ``Blame It on Baby'' by DaBaby fell one spot to No. 4, while Post
Malone's ``Hollywood's Bleeding'' landed at No. 5.
