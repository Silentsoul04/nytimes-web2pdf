# Trump’s Falsehoods on Police Shootings, Biden, Coronavirus and China

</div>

Speaking in the Rose Garden and in an earlier television interview, the
president made incorrect, misleading and exaggerated statements on a
wide variety of topics.

In [a rambling, campaign-style
appearance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/trump-news-conference.html)
in the Rose Garden at the White House and in [an interview with CBS
News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-black-americans-killed-police-white-too/)
on Tuesday, [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/10/us/trump-white-house-shooting.html)
ranged across many topics, sprinkling questionable assertions throughout
his remarks.

What Was Said

*Catherine Herridge, CBS News reporter: “Why are African-Americans still
dying at the hands of law enforcement in this country?”*

*Mr. Trump: “So are white people. So are white people. What a terrible
question to ask. So are white people. More white people, by the way.
More white people.”*  
*—* [*in an interview on
CBS*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJUmK3fUTs)

**This is misleading.** Although more white Americans have been killed
by
[police](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/us/politics/democrats-biden-defund-police.html)
than Black Americans, Black Americans are killed at a far higher rate
than white Americans. Since 2015, The Washington Post [has
logged](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/)
2,499 white Americans killed by police for a rate of 13 per million,
compared with 1,301 Black Americans for a rate of 31 per one million.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A [2018 report](https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2018/11-15-Police-Force.pdf)
by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found “consistent patterns of
racial disparities in police use of force” and urged the Trump
administration’s Justice Department to monitor and train local police
departments.

The commission, an independent federal panel, cited data from The Post
and [The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings)
showing much higher death rates for Black, Latino and Native American
people in officer-involved killings.
[Researchers](https://policeviolencereport.org/) [have also
found](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141854)
that Black Americans are also more likely than white Americans to be
unarmed when killed.

“The best available evidence reflects high rates of use of force
nationally, and increased likelihood of police use of force against
people of color, people with disabilities, L.G.B.T. people, people with
mental health concerns, people with low incomes and those at the
intersections of these groups,” the commission wrote in a letter
addressed to Mr. Trump.

What Was Said

*“Biden personally led the effort to give China permanent
most-favored-nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a
country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn’t
have it, never did, probably never even asked for it because they didn’t
know what they were doing.”*  
— in a news conference at the White House

**False. “**Most favored nation” refers to a principle of fair trade
that members of the World Trade Organization [confer on each
other](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm).
The United States has enjoyed “most favored nation” status from all
members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade since 1947, and
all 164 countries in the W.T.O., except Cuba.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Countries may carve out their own exceptions to this rule, but there are
just a few examples. The United States has declined to grant this
status, also known as normal trade relations, to just two countries:
[Cuba and North
Korea](https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-310?language=en_US). Cuba
reciprocates American sanctions, while North Korea is not a W.T.O.
member.

Furthermore, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and Mr.
Trump’s presumptive 2020 Democratic opponent, was “never the leader” in
making the most-favored-nation status permanent for China, said Gary
Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Rather,
it was an initiative of former President Bill Clinton and established by
former President George W. Bush.

“Permanent M.F.N. status was not a ‘tremendous advantage’ for China,”
Mr. Hufbauer said. “For decades, under both Republican and Democratic
presidents, the U.S. regularly granted M.F.N. status to China. Permanent
M.F.N. did not lower any U.S. tariffs on imports from China. It just
eliminated the need for an extension every two years.”

What Was Said

*“If you look at the job he did on swine flu — I looked at a poll, they
have polls on everything nowadays and he — they got very bad marks on
the job they did on the swine flu. H1N1. He calls it N1H1. H1N1. Got
very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they
stopped very early on, testing.”*

**False.** Mr. **** Trump was referring to the performance of Mr. Biden
and the Obama administration in dealing with the potential for an
earlier pandemic**.** Diagnostic tests for the swine flu were [approved
and shipped
out](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus.html)
less than two weeks after the H1N1 virus was identified in April 2009
and a day before the first death in the United States. From May to
September 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shipped
more than 1,000 kits, each one able to test 1,000 specimens.

Gallup polls showed that 67 percent of Americans were very or somewhat
confident in the government’s ability to handle the H1N1 outbreak. This
February, [77
percent](https://news.gallup.com/poll/286277/high-confidence-government-handle-coronavirus.aspx)
of Americans told Gallup the same about the government’s ability to
handle the coronavirus outbreak — but that percentage has slid as the
pandemic has continued and the death toll has increased. In March, [61
percent](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/296681/ten-key-findings-public-opinion-coronavirus.aspx)
said the same. By April, just [50
percent](https://news.gallup.com/poll/309614/health-institutions-rated-best-covid-response.aspx)
approved of Mr. Trump’s response.

Overall, about 56.7 percent of Americans now disapprove of Mr. Trump’s
response, according to polls aggregated by
[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What Was Said

*“We have just about the lowest mortality rate.”*

**This lacks evidence.** It is difficult to [ascertain accurate death
rates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/coronavirus-death-rate.html)
for the coronavirus and compare them across countries because of
differences in population, testing rates and health care systems. But
based on existing data, Mr. Trump’s claim is not accurate. Out of the 20
countries most affected by the pandemic, the United States has the
sixth-highest case fatality rate at 4 percent and the second highest
rate of deaths per 100,000 people at 41.45, [according to Johns Hopkins
University.](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)

What Was Said

*“Think of this: If we didn’t do testing — instead of testing over 40
million people, if we did half the testing, we’d have half the cases. If
we did another — you cut that in half, you’d have yet again half of
that.”*

**False.** The suggestion that the number of positive cases is directly
proportional to the number of tests conducted is false. Ramped-up
testing does not account for the recent surge in cases. The spread of
the disease does.

In early June, the United States was conducting about 450,000 to 500,000
[tests daily](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/usa)
and the number of daily positive cases hovered around 20,000, for a
positive rate of around 4 percent.

This month, daily testing varied from about 600,000 to 800,000. By Mr.
Trump’s logic, that would roughly correlate to daily positive cases of
between 24,000 and 32,000. But in reality, the number has hovered around
60,000 cases in recent days as the positive testing rate doubled to
about 8 percent.

What Was Said

*“These are the actual key elements of the Biden-Sanders unity
platform.”*

**This is exaggerated.** Mr. Trump was referring to
[recommendations](https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf)
put forth by six policy [task
forces](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/us/politics/biden-bernie-sanders.html)
assembled by both allies of Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of
Vermont, his rival in the Democratic primary. Some of his claims — such
as saying Mr. Biden wants to reach carbon-neutrality, increase the
refugee admissions cap, create a pathway for citizenship for
undocumented immigrants and abolish the death penalty — were accurate.
But many others were dramatized.

The recommendations include a 100-day moratorium on deportations of
people already in the United States — not stopping “all deportations”
indefinitely, as Mr. Trump said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rather than “abolish immigration detention” altogether, the task force
recommended ending the use of for-profit detention facilities and
seeking alternatives for unauthorized immigrants who “do not present a
threat to public safety.”

The task forces did not call to “abolish immigration enforcement,” as
Mr. Trump said, but asked for more oversight of enforcement agencies and
reforms in practices.

They also did not support granting “work permits for illegal
immigrants,” but rather asked for changes to the temporary work visa
program and stronger labor protections for temporary workers.

The task forces did not call to “abolish our police departments,” though
they did recommend creating guidelines on use of force, ending racial
profiling and banning chokeholds.

Rather than “abolish prisons” and “all charter schools,” the
recommendations call for an end to using for-profit private prisons,
banning for-profit charter schools, if they receive federal funding, and
subjecting all charter schools to more scrutiny.

What Was Said

*“We want strong closed borders with people able to come in through
merit through a legal process. They don’t want to have any borders at
all. They’re going to rip down the wall. It was hard to get that built.
And now it’s almost completed, it will be completed by a little after
the end of the year.”*

**This is exaggerated.** The Biden-Sanders unity task forces recommended
halting the use of Pentagon funds to build Mr. Trump’s border wall, but
did not say to tear down existing portions. The president’s claim that
the wall is “almost completed” is also inaccurate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

First, it is unclear exactly what Mr. Trump’s current vision of a
finished wall would look like. Despite promising a wall stretching for
[1,000
miles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/18/us/politics/trump-border-wall-immigration.html)
— along a nearly 2,000 mile border where barriers already had existed
for 654 miles — during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump has conceded that
his wall may not be that long.

The Trump administration has received enough funding, including
transfers from the Department of Defense, to build 738 miles. It has
completed 235 miles and is on track to complete about 450 miles by the
end of the year, according to Customs and Border Protection.

Other false Claims

Mr. Trump also repeated a number of other claims that The New York Times
has previously fact-checked:

  - He
    [falsely](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/04/us/politics/fact-checking-trump-china.html)
    claimed that before the coronavirus epidemic, China was having its
    “worst year, as you know, in 67 years.” (China’s economy grew at
    its slowest rate in [29
    years](https://www.ft.com/content/62524508-3825-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4)
    last year.)

  - He claimed “even experts didn’t want to” place restrictions on
    travel from China. (His health secretary
    [said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/18/us/trump-coronavirus-statements-timeline.html)
    the restrictions were put in place in consultation with health
    officials).

  - He
    [falsely](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/15/us/politics/fact-check-trump-european-union.html)
    claimed that the European Union “was formed in order to take
    advantage of the United States.” (It was created with the support of
    the United States to diminish the risk of wars and promote economic
    cooperation.)

  - He claimed that he “rebuilt” a “totally depleted” military. (The
    military has received some new equipment, but [continues to use
    aging
    supplies.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/13/us/politics/fact-check-trump-military-west-point-speech.html))

  - He claimed that Mr. Biden’s son Hunter “walked out with $1.5
    billion” from China. (This
    [refers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/03/us/politics/hunter-biden-china.html)
    to a company associated with the younger Mr. Biden, but there’s no
    evidence he was personally paid.)

  - He claimed, despite little evidence, that mail-in ballots would lead
    to “tremendous fraud.” ([Voter fraud is extremely
    rare.)](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-vote-fraud-ballot.html)
