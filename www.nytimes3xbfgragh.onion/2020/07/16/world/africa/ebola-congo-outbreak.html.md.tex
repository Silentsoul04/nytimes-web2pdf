Outbreak}\label{who-asks-for-help-fighting-growing-ebola-outbreak}}

The W.H.O.'s current funds for fighting an Ebola outbreak surging in
Congo will only last a few more weeks.

The World Health Organization raised the alarm Thursday about a growing
Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and warned of an
imminent shortage of funds to fight the deadly disease.

The organization said that 56 cases have been reported in Equator
Province, which is greater than the total number of cases recorded in
the province's last outbreak in 2018.

Efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic have complicated the
response to the Ebola outbreak, according to Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the
W.H.O.'s regional director for Africa.

``We must not let Covid-19 distract us from tackling other pressing
health threats,'' Dr. Moeti said. ``The current Ebola outbreak is
running into headwinds because cases are scattered across remote areas
in dense rain forests.''

The W.H.O. said in a statement that it has mobilized \$1.75 million to
combat the Ebola outbreak, which was declared on June 1, but that will
only last a few more weeks. She called for additional funding to help
with vaccinations, testing, contact tracing, treatment and health
education.

Another Ebola outbreak in the east of the country

declared over} on June 25 after two years and 2,280 deaths.

Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the W.H.O.'s emergency
health program, who has worked extensively on Ebola, said on Monday that
as of July 12 there were 17 deaths from confirmed Ebola cases and three
more from suspected cases.

He said that while the numbers may appear low, the threat of spread is
worrisome, especially because of the extreme logistical problems for
health care workers to access remote, affected communities.

``Any one of those individual cases can result in amplification of the
disease,'' he said.

Dr. Moeti said more than 12,000 people have been vaccinated in Equator
in the six weeks since the outbreak started, beginning four days after
the outbreak was declared.
