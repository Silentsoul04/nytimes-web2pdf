LOS ANGELES — Responding to [soaring coronavirus
infections](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html)
and growing concern from teachers, Gov. Gavin Newsom of
[California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/us/ca-schools-reopening.html)
announced new rules on Friday that would force many of the state’s
districts to teach remotely when school starts next month.

More than 80 percent of the state’s population lives in counties that
would currently not qualify for
[schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/us/ca-schools-reopening.html)
to reopen based on their surging caseloads and hospitalization rates.
The rules would also require most students to wear masks in classrooms
and force schools that do hold in-person classes to shut down if enough
students or employees test positive for the virus.

“We all prefer in-classroom instruction for all the obvious reasons,”
Mr. Newsom said, “but only if it can be done safely.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The announcement comes at the end of a week in which many school
districts across the state and the country, including California’s two
largest, [Los Angeles and San
Diego](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html),
abandoned plans for in-person instruction, saying they would start the
school year remotely, and in which California announced [a sweeping
rollback](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html)
of plans to reopen businesses.

our newsletter from the Golden State.\]*

Education leaders in Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Arlington, Va., and
Broward County, Fla., also said this week that they planned to open the
academic year online, despite [pressure from President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html)
and some Republican governors who want students in their classrooms five
days a week.

In Texas, where state officials had previously put limits on online
schooling, [new
guidelines](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdI6_hZWkAAG24Y.jpg) were issued
Friday that would allow as many as eight weeks of online-only
instruction when schools return next month.

And leaders of Chicago’s public school system, the nation’s
third-largest district after New York and Los Angeles, said on Friday
that they were planning for a mix of in-person and online classes. But
they stressed that the announcement was a tentative framework, with a
final plan expected in August. New York City schools are also planning
an in-person and online mix.

The California rules announced on Friday would require schools in
counties that the state has put on a “watchlist” — [based on
indicators](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx)
that include new infections per capita, the test positivity rate and the
hospitalization rate — to teach online until conditions improve.
Currently, 33 of the state’s 58 counties, including many of the most
populated, [are on the
list](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CountyMonitoringDataStep2.aspx).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Counties would have to be off the list for at least two weeks before
their classrooms would be allowed to reopen, but the decision would
still be up to local officials on whether to resume in-person classes,
the governor said.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_1_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Many districts in those counties had already said they would start the
academic year online, including San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, Long
Beach, Santa Ana and San Bernardino. But at least a few districts that
had planned to hold in-person classes would be required to switch.

“Quite frankly, we are going to have to pivot, which is my new least
favorite word,” said Eimear O’Farrell, the superintendent of Clovis
Unified School District in Fresno County, which is on the watchlist.

On Wednesday, the [Central Valley
district](https://www.cusd.com/CUSDAt-A-Glance.aspx) with about 43,000
students [had rolled
out](https://www.fresnobee.com/news/coronavirus/article244300057.html)
what Ms. O’Farrell described as a painstakingly developed plan to
welcome students back to classrooms in August.

“It is a challenge and a source of frustration for us,” she said in a
virtual news conference on Friday afternoon. “Every superintendent has
been aiming to get this information out in time.”

The statewide rules would also require teachers and staff members in
schools that are allowed to reopen to maintain six feet of physical
distance with one another and children, and mandate masks for students
in third grade and up. Younger children would be encouraged but not
required to wear face coverings, and all children would be encouraged to
maintain six feet of distance.

The guidelines recommend that school employees be tested regularly for
the coronavirus, something teachers across the country have been pushing
for, although the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
said doing so [is not
necessary](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-testing.html),
and scaling up testing has been a challenge.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Newsom’s unveiling of a statewide framework for schools marked a
contrast to his usual reluctance to apply one set of policies for all of
California, which he has often described as a kind of [nation-state unto
itself](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/us/california-coronavirus-newsom-nation-state.html),
with roughly 40 million residents spread across a vast and varied
geography.

By and large, [Californians have said they are
supportive](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/us/california-newsom-coronavirus.html)
of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. But Mr. Newsom
has been hesitant to impose statewide orders, instead repeating that
“localism is determinative” and allowing counties to drive much of
their own reopening.

The results have been at times confusing for residents attempting to
navigate [a patchwork of
restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-california-reopening-phases.html)
— though on Monday, in response to climbing numbers of new cases and
shrinking hospital capacity in some areas, he announced the most
[sweeping statewide
rollback](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html)
yet of efforts to reopen many businesses.

Still, the state’s efforts have met pushback from conservative
officials, largely in more rural parts of the state where the virus has
hit less hard, but also in some populous counties.

In Orange County, where local officials have taken public stances
[against many of the state’s
restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/07/14/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-school-politics.html),
the [Board of Education voted this week to
recommend](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/07/15/wagner-chau-back-away-from-controversial-school-board-recommendation/)
that schools reopen without requiring students to wear masks — a
decision that sparked widespread outcry. But the board is largely
advisory and does not carry authority over the county’s more than two
dozen districts, and many education leaders there have said they will
adhere to state and county public health
recommendations.

### School Reopenings ›

#### Back to School

Updated Sept. 11, 2020

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.

  -   - School officials in Des Moines are refusing to hold in-person
        classes, [despite an order from Iowa’s governor and a judge’s
        ruling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/des-moines-school-opening-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup),
        risking school funding and their jobs because they think it’s
        unsafe.
      - The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had one of the
        most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus
        under control. But it [failed to account for students
        partying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/health/university-illinois-covid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).
      - College students are [using apps to shame their
        schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/technology/coronavirus-quarantines-college.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup) into
        better coronavirus plans.
      - For some families, the pandemic [has meant a return to their
        native
        languages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/parenting/family-second-language-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).

That difficulty is mirrored at the federal level, where guidance on the
safety of reopening schools has been unsteady.

On Friday, the C.D.C. postponed releasing new guidance amid a clash with
Mr. Trump, who this month criticized the agency’s proposed school
reopening guidelines as [“very tough and
expensive.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html)
A copy of the draft rules to which Mr. Trump apparently objected,
outlined in a [document obtained by The New York
Times](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html)
and marked “For Internal Use Only,” warned that fully reopening schools
remained “the highest risk” for spreading the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But without being able to send their children to school, parents must
shoulder huge burdens, which affects their ability to work. Tens of
millions of school children are [falling behind
academically](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html),
and the trends will widen existing socioeconomic gaps.

Some educators [are fearful and angry about the prospect of returning to
schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/us/virus-teachers-classrooms.html)
with unanswered questions. The 310,000-member California Teachers
Association [urged state
leaders](https://aarjb2jw4n53e35fhbquj418-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CTA-Elected-Leaders-COVID-Letter-7.8.20.pdf)
this month to require districts to start the year “under robust distance
learning protocols” and described even a hybrid model as “high-risk.”

On Friday, the president of the California Federation of Teachers, which
represents 120,000 school employees, said the state’s new guidelines did
not go far enough to protect them. He objected to the state’s
willingness to allow waivers for some schools in counties on the
watchlist, as well as the lack of mandatory social distancing and
testing for all students.

“This updated guidance still allows for an ‘acceptable amount of harm’
to come to our students, their families and our education
professionals,” the president, Jeff Freitas, said in a statement,
demanding that schools across California continue to provide remote
learning until “the governor can ensure adequate safety measures
throughout the state.”

Erin Springer, who teaches fifth grade at a charter school in Inglewood,
said that starting the new year with remote learning has felt inevitable
since the beginning of summer. She said she wished the call had been
made sooner, so that she and her colleagues could have prepared.

“Almost every teacher I know felt like we were just wasting time,” Ms.
Springer said.

Mr. Newsom emphasized that education officials across the state would be
working hard to ensure that all students would have access to “rigorous
distance learning,” including access to devices and connectivity and
live interactions every day with teachers and other students.

He added that leaders would pay specific attention to students who are
homeless, in the foster care system, or who are English language
learners. The state, he said, has put $5.3 billion in additional money
toward those efforts.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We want to create some sense of equivalency,” Mr. Newsom said.

In Marin County, a Bay Area suburb that is on the state’s watchlist,
Brooke Palizi, a mother of two elementary school students, said the
district recently announced that parents would be able to choose between
letting their children attend socially distant in-person classes, remote
learning, and a virtual academy akin to home schooling.

The new guidelines, she said, at least take the guesswork out of her
children’s back-to-school plans.

“A decision’s been made, instead of it being up in the air, which is
annoying,” she said.
