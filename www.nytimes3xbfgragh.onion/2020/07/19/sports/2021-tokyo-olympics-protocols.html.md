# The Tokyo Olympics Will Open a Year From Now. Maybe.

Japan has largely controlled the coronavirus. Large parts of the rest of
the world, especially the United States, have not. A year before the
rescheduled Games, that is still a major problem.

A year from now, the world will begin to gather in Japan to celebrate
the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, which were originally supposed to
begin this week.

[Or maybe they
won’t.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/sports/olympics/coronavirus-tokyo-olympics.html)

Four months after the International Olympic Committee and officials in
Japan [postponed the
Games](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/sports/olympics/tokyo-olympics-date-coronavirus.html)
amid soaring coronavirus infection rates and lockdowns across the world,
uncertainty prevails. The unpredictable nature of the virus is making it
impossible for officials to say definitively that the Games will happen
or, if they do, what they might look like.

Maybe there won’t be spectators. Maybe only people living in Japan will
be able to attend. Or maybe only those from countries where the virus is
under control. Will there be an Olympic village, the traditional home
for the roughly 10,000 competitors? Will athletes from the United
States, where the [pandemic shows no signs of
abating](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storylines_menu),
be allowed to attend?

In a news conference last week, [Thomas
Bach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/sports/olympics/olympics-coronavirus-bach-ioc.html),
the president of the I.O.C., said that planning for the Games now
involves multiple options. All of them, he said, prioritize the health
of the athletes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It includes all different countermeasures,” Bach said of the planning.
“An Olympic Games behind closed doors is clearly something we do not
want. We are working for a solution that safeguards the health of all
the participants and is also reflecting of the Olympic spirit.”

Bach has said a further postponement is not an option at the moment; if
the Games cannot be held next summer, they will not be held at all.

[As sports leagues everywhere
struggle](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2020/07/14/nba-players-in-orlando-bubble-positive-coronavirus-tests/)
to return to some semblance of normalcy while balancing virus outbreaks
and safety concerns, the challenges of planning a global event that is
still a year away have only grown — or merely been exacerbated as hot
spots for infections continue to shift.

“People right now are focused on the health of the citizens of their
countries,” said Harvey Schiller, the former chief executive of the
United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee.

No one doubts the resolve of the I.O.C. and its local organizers in
Japan, who desperately want to hold the Games, given the resources
they’ve already committed and the money at stake. Japan has already
spent roughly $12 billion to prepare for the Games. The I.O.C. stands to
lose the billions of dollars in [revenues from media
rights](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/05/08/sports/olympics/nbc-extends-olympic-tv-deal-through-2032.html),
tickets and sponsorships if the Games do not happen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Despite a recent spike in coronavirus cases and a[ban on travel from 129
countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html), the
official line in Japan remains that the postponed 2020 Games will open
on July 23, 2021, in Tokyo.

Shortly after Yuriko Koike, the governor of Tokyo,[won a second
term](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/05/world/asia/tokyo-governor-election.html?searchResultPosition=2)
earlier this month, she met with Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to
discuss measures to contain the virus. “I would like to lead the
Olympics and Paralympics next year as proof that we have overcome the
coronavirus,” she said.

On Wednesday, Tokyo raised its pandemic alert level to red, its highest
classification, in response to a recent spike in cases concentrated in
the metropolis’s sprawling nightlife district. In the last two weeks,
Tokyo has recorded several consecutive daily records, hitting a peak of
293 new infections last Friday.

Compared with other international cities, Tokyo has been relatively
successful in containing the virus. A city of 14 million people, it has
reported less than 9,000 cases and 326 deaths since February, compared
with more than [3.5 million cases and nearly 140,000 deaths in the
United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).
Traditionally the financial engine of an Olympics, the United States
currently poses perhaps the biggest threat to the
Games.

### Sports and the Virus

#### 

Updated Sept. 8, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

        his favorite player.
      - The coronavirus pandemic has had an [uneven impact on high

        the United States.
      - The [most complicated puzzle in sports is the return of college
        athletics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-cal-athletics-season.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) during
        a pandemic. The University of California, Berkeley is allowing
        The Times an inside look at their journey’s ups and downs.

Part of Japan’s strategy has been to close its borders to citizens
traveling from 129 countries, including the United States and large
portions of Europe, Africa, Latin America and the rest of Asia. Japan
has recently announced plans to negotiate some reciprocal travel between
Japan and Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Vietnam, but it has not
indicated when it plans to reopen its borders to travelers from the rest
of the world.

Even inside Japan, citizens remain wary about traveling: a plan to
encourage domestic travel was met with resistance as people worried that
Tokyo residents could spread the virus to other parts of the country. On
Friday, the country’s tourism minister discouraged Tokyo residents from
visiting other prefectures and said that government travel discounts
would not apply to travelers to or from Tokyo.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Polls suggest the public is also wary of the Olympics. In a survey late
last month by The Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan’s largest daily
newspapers, 59 percent of those polled said they wanted the Olympics to
be postponed again or canceled. Koike, though, was recently re-elected
governor of Tokyo in a landslide, even as she adhered to the official
position of holding the Games in 2021.

In a sign of the continuing havoc that the coronavirus is inflicting on
the global sports calendar, the I.O.C. on Wednesday postponed the 2022
Summer Youth Olympic Games, planned for Senegal, until 2026. Bach said
holding three Olympics Games — the Tokyo Games, the 2022 Winter Olympics
in Beijing and the 2024 Summer Games in Paris — plus youth Games in 2022
and 2024 was too overwhelming. The same day, Richard W. Pound, a
longtime member of the I.O.C. from Canada, floated the possibility of a
cancellation of the Beijing Games [in an interview with
Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-beijing-pound-interview/olympics-no-tokyo-games-likely-means-no-beijing-either-says-pound-idUSKCN24G30L).
On Friday, Bach said specific plans for how the Tokyo Games would unfold
were still far from complete.

“How can you know already in detail maybe the most complex event to
organize in the world?” Bach said in a news conference in which he
announced his intention to seek another term as I.O.C. president. “You
can put potential developments together, but you cannot have a solution
today.”

The coronavirus has forced NBC, which has committed about $8 billion for
the United States [media rights to the Games
through 2032](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/05/08/sports/olympics/nbc-extends-olympic-tv-deal-through-2032.html)
and is the I.O.C.’s leading source of revenue, to consider reducing its
contingent of roughly 2,000 workers and hundreds of guests. NBC also has
had to rethink how it will present the story of the Olympics, since that
story has changed significantly.

“It’s impossible to predict what the circumstances will be a year from
now,” said Molly Solomon, the executive producer of NBC’s Olympics
production. With social distancing limiting her team’s access to
athletes, they have asked competitors to document their training
regimens so the network has footage of this transformative experience.
“I do think this has a chance to be the most memorable Games in
history,” Solomon said.

During a recent conference call with athletes, though, leaders of the
U.S.O.P.C. had few concrete answers. No one could say if athletes would
still have to share rooms in the Olympic Village, if the common dining
hall would be a potentially germ-spreading buffet, or if the American
team — traditionally the biggest contingent at any Games — might have to
be housed separately from people representing other nations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Athletes are yearning for more concrete communication directly from the
I.O.C. and other organizations,” said Han Xiao, chairman of the
U.S.O.P.C.’s Athletes’ Advisory Council.

The United States team of more than 500 athletes might have to be
smaller, though so far the I.O.C. has maintained that it does not plan
to reduce the number of events or participants.

“There is a lot of speculation and proposals, but not one specific plan
that anyone is able to focus on,” said Christian Taylor, a two-time gold
medalist in the triple jump.

Rick Adams, the chief of sport performance at the U.S.O.P.C., said the
organization remained focused on Plan A — a typical Olympic Games with
most athletes living and eating in the Olympic Village and using a
training center the U.S.O.P.C. will set up in Tokyo’s Setagaya City
neighborhood. But the organization also has considered how it would
adjust if it has to come up with an alternative plan for housing and
feeding its team, and for shrinking its support staff.

“We understand what a pivot might look like,” Adams said. “We know how
to adjust quickly and would be able to do that.”

Xiao, the athletes’ council chairman, said thinking about travel
restrictions is keeping athletes awake at night. Many need to compete to
qualify for the Games, and also to hone their skills for an event that
for many is the zenith of their athletic lives. Doing that properly
requires the intensity of competition, Xiao said. But athletes also need
assurances that they will be allowed to take part.

Governments generally can’t interfere with a qualified athlete’s right
to participate in the Games, but those debates are usually related to
political issues. The coronavirus has changed the equation.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Our athletes are used to, ‘You can’t infringe upon my right to
compete,’” Xiao said. “But this is going to be a real challenge to try
to figure out where that line is.”
