\textbf{Tesla} on Wednesday reported a profit of \$104 million, a result
that surprised analysts, who were expecting the electric carmaker to
lose money as the coronavirus pandemic squeezed the company on two
fronts.

Sales for the second quarter, which ended in June, slowed while much of
the economy shut down and as millions of people lost their jobs and cut
back on spending. And for nearly two months, the company was forced to
halt production at its main plant in Fremont, Calif.

``We were able to achieve a fourth consecutive profitable quarter,'' the
company's chief executive, Elon Musk, said in a conference call with
analysts. ``Although the auto industry was down about 30 percent
year-over-year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the
year.''

started work on a fourth car factory} at a site near Austin, Texas, Mr.
Musk said, where it will produce its forthcoming pickup truck, the
Cybertruck, and a new semi truck, along with its Model 3 and Model Y.

Tesla's surprise profit set it up for another major milestone:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/22/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/tesla-s-and-p-500}{potential
inclusion in the S\&P 500 index}. The index is one the most widely
followed measures of the performance of the American stock market, with
more than \$11 trillion worth of mutual funds and other investments
measured against it.

It's unusual for companies with market values as large as Tesla ---
roughly \$290 billion --- not to be included in the S\&P 500. But the
company's inability to consistently generate profits has made it
ineligible so far. (Criteria for inclusion require the sum of the
company's fully audited profits in the four most recent quarters to be
positive.)
