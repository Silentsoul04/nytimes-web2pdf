In late June, Holly Aubry, who owns a public relations firm in New York,
got the first aesthetic treatments she’d ever had in her life: Botox,
filler and a brow suture lift.

She had never spent much money or time on beauty treatments; she had had
few facials, and shopping at Sephora was rare. But when Dr. Lara Devgan,
a plastic surgeon in New York, reopened her office last month, Ms. Aubry
went in for a consultation and got treated the same day. That office
visit was one of the few outings she had taken since March.

Ms. Aubry, 40, could pinpoint her unease: “Hearing the sirens from my
apartment. Being constantly terrified of getting sick. Having my kids
home, compromising my ability to run my company. Seeing what the
pandemic has done to the economy. All of it made me stressed, and I
started noticing that I was aging rapidly.”

Throughout the lockdown, wait lists for nonessential, noninvasive
skin-care appointments — those laser procedures, fillers and Botox
injections — grew. Dr. Ben Talei, a plastic surgeon in Los Angeles,
reported that he and his colleagues are seeing people who are clamoring
for care now, especially for anything that has healing time.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“They want to do it now while it’s not interfering with their work and
social lives,” Dr. Talei said.

A surge of catch-up appointments was probably predictable. But what will
the aesthetic world look like after an initial surge? Will more of us
have a list of things we’d like to fix after becoming better acquainted
with our features over innumerable virtual meetings?

Or, after a long break from a doctor’s office and a reliance on at-home
skin care, will we realize that we don’t need medical intervention after
all?

Then there’s the most important consideration of all: How do we do any
of this safely?

## The pandemic will change how we look.

With masks covering most of our faces, we’ll likely turn our attention
to our eyes, doctors say. Dr. Devgan expects more requests for under-eye
filler, Botox brow lifts and eyelid surgery.

“I also think that as we cover our faces, we’ll reveal more of our
bodies,” she said. “That will create an emphasis on the aesthetics of
the torso, buttocks and legs.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As practices reopen, doctors are indeed seeing an increase in requests
for body treatments. Typically, summer would be a slow time for
surgeries as people plan for beach vacations spent in revealing
clothing. But these days, said Dr. Sachin Shridharani, a plastic surgeon
in New York, “because the pandemic has limited travel, they’re doing
these procedures now.”

According to the Aesthetic Society, a professional organization and
advocacy group for board-certified plastic surgeons that gathers data
from plastic surgery practices nationwide, liposuction and tummy tucks
made up 31 percent of total procedures in June, up from 26 percent in
June 2019. Breast procedures were up 4.3 percent over last June.

“In my own practice, if you take into account the time that we were
closed, breast augmentations and breast lifts are up significantly when
compared to last year,” said Dr. Herluf Lund, a plastic surgeon in St.
Louis and the president of the Aesthetic Society.

Nonsurgical body treatments, particularly injectables, are in demand as
well.

“We’re seeing a lot of interest in what can be done with a syringe
instead of a scalpel,” Dr. Shridharani said. Injectables, typically
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the face, can be
effective at tackling body concerns.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

For instance, Dr. Shridharani treats patients with Kybella, an acid that
is injected to dissolve a double chin, to melt fat in the abdomen, arms
and thighs. He also has been injecting small amounts of diluted
Sculptra, a product that stimulates the body to produce more collagen,
into arms and thighs to help smooth crepey skin. (Dr. Shridharani is
compensated financially for work with the companies that manufacture
Kybella and Sculptra.) What may be on the wane are the excessive fillers
and Botox that we’ve grown used to seeing on celebrities and
influencers. Steven Pearlman, a plastic surgeon in New York, said that
he expects the baby-smooth, motionless foreheads and overfilled lips and
cheeks — already diminishing in popularity — to retreat even more
rapidly now.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“People have seen their faces relax into something more natural during
the lockdowns,” Dr. Pearlman said. “And because of all that’s going on
in society, too, they are going to realize it’s not important to have
that extreme
look.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Social media habits will change, too.

It’s tough to say whether or not we’ll be sharing (or oversharing)
scenes from our Botox appointments on Instagram. In a climate of
coronavirus concerns, economic suffering and mounting national unrest,
posting one’s very expensive cosmetic procedures on social media could,
and arguably should, invite criticism.

At the end of May and the beginning of the Black Lives Matter protests,
aesthetic doctors noticeably paused their streams of striking
before-and-after shots. “We wanted to be sensitive, of course,” Dr.
Pearlman said. “Everyone was considering, ‘What is the right thing to
post at this moment, and should we be posting at
all?’”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

On the other hand, social media has been an essential mode of connection
during monthslong lockdowns. People have grown comfortable sharing
life’s details with their followers. Perhaps we will land in a middle
ground where instead of posting about procedures on their own social
media feeds, more patients will allow their doctors to share their
procedure photos.

“I wouldn’t have given my permission to post before going through this
experience,” Ms. Aubry said. “But I wanted other women who were feeling
as I did to know that there are options, and they shouldn’t have any
shame in pursuing
them.”

## But is it safe to have aesthetic procedures right now?

In medicine, everything is about risk-benefit,” said Dr. Adolf Karchmer,
an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at Harvard
Medical School. “Some people feel they need these procedures for
psychological or even professional benefit.” The risk of getting the
coronavirus when out in the world will never be zero, but offices should
enact safety protocols to reduce the risk to a negligible level, he
said.

Dr. Karchmer served on a task force that developed Project AesCert,
safety guidelines for reopening. For patients, there are a few main
lessons.

First, safety begins before you arrive at the office. Practices will be
screening patients based on presence of symptoms, potential exposures
and pre-existing conditions. Some practices may turn away individuals at
high risk for Covid-19.

“The first thing the patient should be asking is, ‘What is this practice
saying about their safety protocols,’” Dr. Lund said. “When you call,
can they describe without hesitation what they’re doing? Is it on their
website?”

When you arrive, you’ll have your temperature taken. Paperwork will have
been handled online before your appointment. Everyone should be in
masks. The doctor will have on personal protective equipment, likely an
N95 mask, face shield, gown and gloves.

Doctors are in agreement that many consultations and follow-ups will by
default be done virtually to keep traffic in office to a minimum.

“Because of the risk of coronavirus exposure, the stakes are higher than
ever for aesthetics,” Dr. Devgan said. Medical resources are still not
optimal, she said, making it a bad time to have a complication from a
procedure.
