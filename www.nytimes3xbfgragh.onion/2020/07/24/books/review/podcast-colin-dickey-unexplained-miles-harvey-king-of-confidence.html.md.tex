In his new book,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/books/review/the-unidentified-colin-dickey.html}{``The
Unidentified,''} Colin Dickey writes about Bigfoot, alien visitations
and other phenomena that science seems unable to explain --- and looks
at the cults that have developed around them.

``I wanted to dig a little deeper into the genealogy of where some of
these beliefs come from,'' Dickey says. ``I really wanted to understand
how we became a culture that is yearning for the unbelievable, that is
yearning for something that is beyond the reach of science and
religion.''

Miles Harvey visits the podcast to talk about his new book,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/books/review/king-of-confidence-miles-harvey-james-jesse-strang.html}{``The
King of Confidence,''} his fascinating history of James Jesse Strang, a
19th-century grifter who ruled over a breakaway religious colony.

``From an early age, he dreamt of being a lawyer, a politician, a
statesman,'' Harvey says. ``At one point in these journals, he talks
about how he wants to marry Britain's Princess Victoria, who was then
not Queen Victoria, and he says: `If only I had a chance to do this, I
could pull it off.' So, he was an amazing self-actualizer in a time
where self-reinvention was just rampant. This was the great age of the
self-made man. And I always think how similar Strang's career was to
Abraham Lincoln's: both these country lawyers, both state reps,
postmasters. And for a long time, Strang was more famous than Lincoln.''

Also on this week's episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the
publishing world; and Dwight Garner and Parul Sehgal talk about what
people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
