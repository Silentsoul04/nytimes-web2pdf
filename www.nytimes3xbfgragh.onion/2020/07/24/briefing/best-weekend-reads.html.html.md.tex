of this strange summer. I hope you get a chance to savor the small joys

Representative John Lewis,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/john-lewis-dead.html}{who
died last Friday}, was an apostle of nonviolence who was bloodied at
Selma and across the Jim Crow South in the historic struggle for racial
equality. Pictured above in 1967, he was later called the conscience of
the Congress.

As the news emerged that Mr. Lewis had died,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/politics/john-lewis-dies-reaction.html}{bipartisan
praise poured in} for the civil rights icon from the nation's political
elite. His
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/us/John-Lewis-Atlanta.html}{death
was also mourned by many in Atlanta}, where he connected the lions of
the civil rights movement to a new generation of activists in the city.
