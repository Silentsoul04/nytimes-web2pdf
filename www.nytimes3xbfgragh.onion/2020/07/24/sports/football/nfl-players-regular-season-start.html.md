# Wary of Other Leagues’ Battles, N.F.L. and Players Agree on Terms to Return

As training camps get underway, the two sides finalized plans to reduce
the salary cap and scrap preseason games, an agreement that paves the
way for the regular season to begin as scheduled on Sept. 10.

The N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association have finalized the last
key financial issues related to this season, paving the way for an
on-time start to the regular season on Sept. 10.

In the deal reached late Friday after a vote by the union’s 32 team
representatives, the salary cap — or the maximum amount teams can spend
on their rosters — will remain at just under $200 million per team this
season. But the cap will have a minimum of $175 million next season. Any
shortfalls in revenue next year will be made up by reducing the salary
cap through the 2023 season.

The owners also agreed to a player proposal to scrap all preseason games
to reduce the risk of infection.

The sides had already agreed on several measures to reduce the risk of
infection from the coronavirus as teams return to camps, meetings and
practices, including outlining who can be inside team facilities and
daily player testing for the virus.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the owners and the players’ union had remained deadlocked on
thornier questions, even as players began reporting to team facilities
this week, leading some star players to [start a public relations
offensive on social
media](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/sports/football/nfl-training-camp-players.html)
pushing for their concerns. Those included how much players will be paid
if the season is shortened or canceled, and how to reduce the players’
share of the loss of revenue if teams do not allow fans at games this
season.

All players have to report to training camp by July 28. But with each
team required to test players and staff members at least twice before
allowing them to enter their facilities to take physicals, it is more
likely that practices will begin in early August.

Though all sides hope to open the regular season on Sept. 10, it remains
unclear whether teams will allow any fans to attend. Earlier this week,
the league said that fans would be [required to wear
masks](https://twitter.com/NFLprguy/status/1285995479596228615) at games
and both the [Giants and Jets became the first N.F.L.
franchises](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/sports/football/jets-giants-rutgers-fans-metlife-stadium.html)
to say that they would play regular-season games at MetLife Stadium
without spectators, heeding New Jersey’s prohibitions on mass
gatherings. Some teams like the Miami Dolphins and the New England
Patriots have announced plans to limit their stadium’s capacity to allow
for fans.

“The season will undoubtedly present new and additional challenges, but
we are committed to playing a safe and complete 2020 season, culminating
with the Super Bowl,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement.

The league earns about one-quarter of its $15 billion in annual revenue
from local sources, including ticket sales, parking, food and beverage
sales, luxury boxes and sponsorships. The loss of income from these
fan-less games could cost the owners and players several billion
dollars, though the precise amount will not be determined until the end
of the season.

The players and the league agreed on the wide-ranging parameters, having
had the benefit of observing other professional leagues negotiate
returns with their
unions.

### Sports and the Virus

#### 

Updated Sept. 8, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - As the United States Open enters its second week without fans,
        an Italian restaurateur stands outside the gates and [bellows

        his favorite player.
      - The coronavirus pandemic has had an [uneven impact on high

        the United States.
      - The [most complicated puzzle in sports is the return of college
        athletics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-cal-athletics-season.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) during
        a pandemic. The University of California, Berkeley is allowing
        The Times an inside look at their journey’s ups and downs.

Although the N.F.L. and union locked horns the talks were considered to
be [less acrimonious than those between Major League
Baseball](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/sports/baseball/rob-manfred-mlb-season.html)
and its players’ union.

While the owners are taking some steps, like selling additional
sponsorships, to reduce their revenue losses, the players and owners had
to decide[how to offset the players’ share of the
losses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/sports/football/nfl-salary-cap-no-fans.html).
The owners wanted to put 35 percent of player salaries this season in
escrow, determine what the losses were at the end of the year and return
any difference.

The players preferred to spread out the losses over as many as 10 years
by reducing the salary cap. They ultimately agreed to recoup the losses
over three seasons.

In the new [collective bargaining agreement signed in
March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/15/sports/football/nfl-cba-approved.html),
the players are owed 48 percent of league revenue, which means they are
on the hook for that percentage of any losses. That labor deal does not
include a clause that would allow the owners to forgo paying the players
following certain extraordinary events, like natural disasters or terror
attacks.

Still, the start of training camp was never in doubt because the owners
have the right to open camps at their discretion, and players who do not
report could face penalties. But the union had pushed for a host of
steps and the negotiations over player health and safety largely
concluded just before the first rookies had to report to training camp
on July 20.

The league also agreed to test the players every day for the first two
weeks they are in camp and if the rate of positive tests is below 5
percent, tests will be provided every other day.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to the players’ union, 95 players and staff members tested
positive for the coronavirus during the off-season. The league expects
potentially hundreds of players to test positive when the nearly 2,900
rookies, veterans and free agents travel from across the country to get
tested by their teams before they begin training camp.
