*In this new series, The Artists, an installment of which will publish
every day this week and regularly thereafter, T will highlight a recent
or little-shown work by a Black artist, along with a few words from that
artist, putting the work into context. Today, we’re looking at a piece
by Howardena Pindell, a painter and mixed-media artist whose work
explores themes of racism, sexism and
xenophobia.*

**Name:** [Howardena Pindell](https://www.howardenapindell.org/)

**Age:** 77

**Based in:** New York City

**Originally from:** Philadelphia

**When and where did you make this work?** In my studio in New York
City. I moved out of my loft to a large apartment on account of the rent
increase in 1987. I had a loft in SoHo on Broome Street. I worked on it
in the room I now use as a bedroom. My ceilings are about 10 feet high,
**** and I was able to install tract lighting.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Can you describe what’s going on in it?** It is part of my
“Autobiography” series. (It is in the collection of the [Studio Museum
in
Harlem](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/studio-museum-in-harlem).)
I have four portraits of myself, one as a little child holding a ball,
which I find interesting since I use the circle, and one with the foot
of my ex-boss at the Modern stepping on my head \[Pindell worked at the
Museum of Modern Art from 1967 to 1979\]. She was not pleasant. I lay
down on the canvas and cut out my figure and put in realistic portrait
heads, which I painted from photographs of me at various ages. It also
deals with issues of **** racism in the upper right area where there is
a target. I enjoy using text and images. I think my childhood exposure
to ancient Egyptian art, in which text is image and image is text, ****
influenced me. A family friend said that there was a mummy in the
[Philadelphia
Museum](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/organization/philadelphia-museum-of-art)
that looked like me. I was taken to the museum as a result. It was a
Fayum, an encaustic mummy with the portrait painted on a linen-like
cloth wrapping. I went to see the pyramids, in Luxor and Thebes, and the
tombs in the Valley of the Kings in 1974.

**What inspired you to make this work?** I had been in a car accident in
1979 as a passenger and sustained a head injury. After that, I moved
from abstraction to works that **** had a personal narrative and in some
cases dealt with issues of racism and women’s rights. One painting in
the series dealt with wife-burning in India. It was seen many years ago
as an honor to jump onto one’s husband’s burning funeral pyre. It
apparently still happens in more remote areas, although it has been
outlawed. The wife’s hands were traced onto the Hindu temple’s ****
outside walls. I **** lived in India for **** about four months and have
lived in the desert. I also have friends there.

**What’s the work of art in any medium that changed your life?** I feel
that my transition **** from oil to acrylic changed my life. I was
trained as a figurative painter and used oil. I went to Yale’s School of
Art and Architecture for my M.F.A. and was very influenced by the range
of work I saw there. After I graduated, my work gradually became more
abstract. I liked manipulating textures that I could get with acrylic.
Oil takes a year to completely dry and can crack. Acrylic can crack if
you freeze it, and you cannot heat it as the fumes are toxic. You can
heat up oil paint with wax to create works that are **** encaustic, just
do not hang it over the
fireplace.
