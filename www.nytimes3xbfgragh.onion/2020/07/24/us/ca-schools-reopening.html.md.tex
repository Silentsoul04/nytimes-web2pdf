Analise Yaldoo, a reader in San Diego, asked: ``How come bars,
restaurants, etc. are allowed to open but not my college campus? I
understand the health risk, but why are schools not a priority in being
reopened?''

Ms. Yaldoo, who attends San Diego State University, says that her online
classes are not a replacement for the real thing. ``I see everyone out
and about at beaches and bars and gyms and malls yet I am being denied
my college experience,'' she wrote last month.

Virtual learning has allowed classes to continue throughout the
pandemic, but critics of online classrooms say that the format is
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/virtual-learning-challenges.html}{hard
on educators} and students, especially those who come from low-income
households and for students with special needs.

And proponents of returning to school point to promising evidence that
children affected with Covid-19 generally
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/20/parenting/coronavirus-children-spread-covid-19.html}{fare
better than adults}. One
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-children-schools.html}{South
Korean study} found that children younger than 10 transmit the virus to
others much less often than adults do. However, the same study also
found that those between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at
least as well as adults.

Some countries have successfully reopened schools, but
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/health/coronavirus-schools-reopen.html}{as
my colleagues reported}, no nation has begun sending children back to
school with infection rates like the ones currently in the United
States.

I asked Brad Pollock, who has a Ph.D. in epidemiology and is the
associate dean for public health sciences at the University of
California, Davis, School of Medicine, about why schools in California
will remain closed. As chair of the University of California's Public
Health Covid-19 Working Group, he has been tracking the pandemic since
early March.

``It's a very complex situation,'' Dr. Pollock said.

\textbf{Why schools have not reopened}

California's case count has skyrocketed in recent weeks, and on
Wednesday it passed another grim milestone. With more than 422,000
cases,
\href{https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/template/oakv2?campaign_id=49\&emc=edit_ca_20200723\&instance_id=20550\&nl=california-today\&productCode=CA\&regi_id=68519573\&segment_id=34150\&te=1\&uri=nyt\%3A\%2F\%2Fnewsletter\%2Fd06fbed3-5fc5-5726-96ee-09eb885ed4c7\&user_id=ac4ca2966d3316b2e2f6ffbb6a584192}{California
has more coronavirus cases than any other state}, according to The New
York Times's database. California also broke its single-day record on
Wednesday, with more than 12,100 new cases announced.

\emph{{[}See The Times's}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html}{\emph{map
tracking coronavirus cases}} \emph{across the state.{]}}

As my colleague
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/california-schools-reopening-newsom.html}{Jill
Cowan reported} last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced new rules that
would force many of the state's districts to teach remotely when school
starts next month. More than 80 percent of the state's population lives
in counties that would currently not qualify for schools to reopen based
on their surging caseloads and hospitalization rates.

``We all prefer in-classroom instruction for all the obvious reasons,''
Mr. Newsom said, ``but only if it can be done safely.''

California's two largest school
districts,\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html}{Los
Angeles and San Diego}, said they would start the year remotely and the
California State University chancellor, Timothy White, said that remote
learning at the universities in the system could be extended
\href{https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/education-lab/article244114417.html}{throughout
the academic year}.

\emph{{[}Read the full story on}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/california-schools-reopening-newsom.html}{\emph{the
state's reopening plan}}\emph{.{]}}

\textbf{When will it be safe for schools to reopen?}

The statewide rules announced last week would require schools in
counties that have been put on a ``watch list'' ---
\href{https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx}{based
on indicators} that include new infections per capita, the test
positivity rate and the hospitalization rate --- to teach online until
conditions improve. Currently, 33 of the state's 58 counties, where more
than 80 percent of the state's population lives,
\href{https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CountyMonitoringDataStep2.aspx}{are
on the list}.

Counties would have to be off the list for at least two weeks before
their classrooms would be allowed to reopen, but the decision would
still be up to local officials on whether to resume in-person classes,
the governor said.

Given the rising number of infections in California, only a safe and
effective vaccine that is distributed enough to drive up the effects of
herd immunity will make it safe for children and teachers to return to
classrooms, according to Dr. Pollock.

``Vaccination is really the way out of this,'' he said. ``You're not
going to have enough herd immunity in the population at the current
infection rates, even if they increase. We'll have a vaccine long before
the number of infected individuals survive and develop natural
immunity.''

Even with vaccinations in place, Dr. Pollock thinks that safety
precautions, like practicing social distancing and using personal
protective equipment, will still probably have to be in place in
schools.

\textbf{So, until then, virtual learning?}

Some parents, despondent over having to endure additional months of
online learning with their children, are scrambling to put together
\href{https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/template/oakv2?campaign_id=9\&emc=edit_nn_20200723\&instance_id=20544\&nl=the-morning\&productCode=NN\&regi_id=68519573\&segment_id=34125\&te=1\&uri=nyt\%3A\%2F\%2Fnewsletter\%2F24324301-f498-593b-8489-bd33767d6a8c\&user_id=ac4ca2966d3316b2e2f6ffbb6a584192}{home-schooling
pods and microschools}.

For universities, however, the pandemic has accelerated the use of
virtual classrooms, and the introduction of new
technology\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/education/learning/coronavirus-online-education-college.html}{will
leave a lasting impact on college classrooms, according to some
experts}.

Dr. Pollock said he imagined that, after the pandemic, his faculty at
U.C. Davis may carry these virtual lessons forward in some way, either
in a hybrid learning model or to make classes more accessible to
students.

After a successful quarter teaching entirely online, he sees proof in
the concept. ``Somebody told me that this couldn't be done,'' he said.
``Well, you know, I guess it could be done because we did it.''
