# True Crime Podcasts at the Intersection of Race

</div>

True crime is the lifeblood of podcasting. Here’s a list of shows that
make racial justice their
focus.

When people think of true crime podcasts, they inevitably think of
“Serial.” But the genre is vast, and the podcasts listed here
represent that diversity: a mother who investigates the death of her own
son, a journalist recovering the lost history of a nearly forgotten race
massacre, two friends telling each other stories about their favorite
serial killers of color. They all have one thing in common: These
stories are also about how racism and inequality intersect with the
deeply flawed systems of criminal justice.

## [Somebody](https://theintercept.com/podcasts/somebody/)

Produced by the digital news outfit The Intercept,
“[Somebody](https://theintercept.com/podcasts/somebody/)” is an
investigation into the 2016 death of 22-year old Courtney Copeland in
Chicago. What makes the show stand out is its host, Shapearl Wells, who
is Copeland’s mother. After the police refused to release any
information or look into the night Copeland was found outside a police
station with a fatal bullet wound, Wells decided to get to the bottom of
what happened herself. The result is a deeply personal story of a
mother’s pursuit of justice, enhanced by the music and testimony of
one of Copeland’s friends from high school, Chance the Rapper.

## [Black Wall Street 1921](https://www.blackwallstreet-1921.com/)

The recent HBO series “Watchmen” renewed America’s attention to what is
thought to be one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American
history: the race massacre that destroyed Greenwood, an affluent
district in Tulsa, Okla., known as “Black Wall Street.” In this
meticulously narrated podcast, the reporter Nia Clark uses new and
archival interviews to paint the fullest picture of the intertwined
economic and racial conditions that exploded into two days of mass death
and property destruction at the hands of white terrorists, and of what
happened in the
aftermath.

## [Missing and Murdered: Finding Cleo](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/findingcleo)

There is an epidemic of violence against Native women in North America.
The [U.S. Department of
Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/ovw/blog/protecting-native-american-and-alaska-native-women-violence-november-native-american)
found that Native American women are murdered at a rate of more than 10
times the national average, and one in three Native women will
experience sexual violence at some point in her life. A [Canadian
national
inquiry](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/03/world/canada/canada-indigenous-genocide.html)
last year called the country’s crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous
women in recent decades “a Canadian genocide.” The investigative
reporter Connie Walker, who is Cree and from the Okanese First Nation in
Saskatchewan, tells the stories of some of these women and girls in
“Missing and Murdered.” In the first season, Walker hosted an
eight-part series on the 1989 unsolved murder of 24-year-old Alberta
Williams in British Columbia. The second season centers on the
unexplained disappearance of a Saskatchewan girl, Cleopatra Semaganis
Nicotine, who was, along with her five siblings, a victim of the forced
separation of Indigenous children from their families by social workers
in Canada, known as the “[Sixties
Scoop](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/06/world/canada/indigenous-forced-adoption-sixties-scoop.html).”
But Cleo vanished, and her family has spent decades trying to find her,
believing she was raped and murdered. Walker’s shoe-leather reporting
eventually does answer the question: What happened to
Cleo?

## [74 Seconds](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/04/24/74-seconds-podcast-peabody-mpr-news)

In this Peabody Award-winning Minnesota Public Radio series, the title
refers to the time elapsed after the police officer Jeronimo Yanez
turned on his lights to pull over Philando Castile’s white Oldsmobile in
2016 in a Minneapolis suburb, and the moment Yanez fired seven bullets
into the elementary-school cafeteria worker. The hosts Jon Collins,
Riham Feshir and Tracy Mumford start their 22-part story with some of
the events that led up to that fateful day and follow the case through
its
verdict.

## [Fruit Loops](https://fruitloopspod.com/#:~:text=Fruitloops%20is%20a%20weekly%20podcast,by%20serial%20killers%20of%20color.)

Murder doesn’t necessarily lend itself to humor, but the 2016 podcast
“[My Favorite
Murder](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/05/19/style/my-favorite-murder-podcast-murderinos.html)”
— in which funny people tell each other the stories of serial killers
and horrific crimes — put “[comedy murder
podcasts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/16/arts/television/the-transgressive-appeal-of-the-comedy-murder-podcast.html)”
on the map. Still, it is hardly the only pod of its kind. Enter Wendy
and Beth Williams (both pseudonyms), two best friends and true-crime
lovers who noticed the dearth of diversity in the genre, in terms of
those shows’ hosts and the subjects they choose. Their show “Fruit
Loops” has many of the same beats as other buddy chat shows; the
difference is in their topic of choice. Wendy, a millennial who
identifies as Black and Latinx, and Beth, a white Gen X’er, swap stories
of serial killers of color and their victims, because, as they say,
contrary to popular belief, “not all serial killers are white\!” Like
all true crime co-hosts, the pair chew on and reacts to the details of
each case, but from multiracial, multigenerational perspectives.
