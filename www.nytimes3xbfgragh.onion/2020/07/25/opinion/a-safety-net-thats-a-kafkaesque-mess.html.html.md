In July 1988, a crowd of roughly 40 protesters gathered outside the Los
Angeles Federal Building. As they chanted, their leader, Dr. Paul
Longmore, a visiting scholar at Stanford, set fire to a biography of
George Washington on a small barbecue grill.

Dr. Longmore did not hate our first president — far from it. The [book
he was burning was in fact one he had
written](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/08/11/129127432/paul-longmore-historian-and-advocate-for-disabled-dies).
A survivor of polio who relied on a ventilator and personal care aides
paid for by Medicaid, Dr. Longmore had organized the demonstration to
protest Social Security Administration policies that prevented him from
being paid for writing it.

Supplemental Security Income — a cash assistance program whose
beneficiaries also get Medicaid coverage — sharply limits the income and
assets of those who receive it. If Dr. Longmore were to receive
royalties from his publisher, he stood to lose over $20,000 a year in
services, without which he could not survive.

Dr. Longmore would later have an illustrious academic career, becoming
[a founder of disability
history](https://longmoreinstitute.sfsu.edu/paul-k-longmore). In time,
his activism would lead to modest changes to Social Security rules on
book royalties. But even as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the
Americans with Disabilities Act, disabled people still struggle with
byzantine rules for work.

Today, over eight million people receive S.S.I. benefits (not to be
confused with Social Security Disability Insurance, which offers
assistance on less onerous terms to those with sufficient work history).
[Slightly more than
half](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_monthly/2020-06/table02.html)
are working-age adults with disabilities. Of these,
[approximately 340,000](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_asr/2018/sect07.html#_blank)
work. While impairment plays some role in this low employment rate, so
too does the complexity of the system and the dire consequences of
making a wrong move.

[Working beneficiaries](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf) of
S.S.I. generally keep their first $85 in income each month, after which
they lose $1 in benefits for every $2 of earnings, what amounts to a 50
percent marginal “tax rate.” Receiving food and shelter from family or
friends [cuts the amount of the benefit by
one-third](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-living-ussi.htm#_blank).
Beneficiaries are prohibited from saving more than $2,000. This [limit
has been the same
since 1984.](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/disability_trends/sect05.html)

Beneficiaries can keep additional assets and income by setting up a Plan
to Achieve Self Support — a written plan that must be submitted to and
approved by the agency — but doing so is sufficiently complex [that
only 568
people](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_asr/2018/sect07.html#_blank)
in the entire country made use of this option in 2018. Nor are benefits
so generous that recipients have no need to work — the [monthly federal
S.S.I. payment for 2020](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/SSI.html) was a
mere $783. While many states supplement this, recipients still face
terrible poverty.

Keeping track of these arcane details would be difficult for anyone. For
low-income adults with intellectual disabilities and mental illnesses,
[who make up
most](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/ssi_asr/2018/sect07.html#_blank)
working S.S.I. recipients, it is nearly impossible. Failure to do so can
have awful consequences. The agency often overpays working disabled
recipients, [only to notify them that they must pay back thousands of
dollars](https://newrepublic.com/article/158095/civil-legal-system-no-money-no-lawyer-no-justice),
sometimes years after the fact.

Looking at the mess facing S.S.I. recipients who try to work, one feels
that a terrible mistake has been made. But history tells a different
story: this Kafkaesque nightmare was a deliberate choice.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the Social Security Act passed in 1935, its architects had a
problem. Amid the Great Depression, the elderly faced horrifying
poverty. And yet, because Social Security’s Old Age Insurance program
required beneficiaries to have paid into the system in order to get
benefits, the existing generation of seniors could never qualify for the
program. To rectify this, Congress funded states to establish public
assistance programs for seniors, single mothers and the blind.

But offering immediate cash assistance presented a risk. If recipients
of public assistance could get help on the same easy terms as “earned
benefits” like Old Age Insurance, what motivation would they have to pay
into Social Security?

Before Social Security’s passage, blind activists had convinced several
states to establish blindness pension programs that gave a flat cash
grant with limited asset and income restrictions. States [established
similar benefits for the
elderly](https://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/ces/ces2witte2.html) too.
Many wished to let those receiving benefits participate in the work
force and receive help from family and friends, seeing government help
as perfectly compatible with living a “normal” life.

In the law’s early years, federal officials, including the Social
Security Board’s chairman Arthur Altmeyer, feared that generous state
public assistance programs would build momentum for replacing Old Age
Insurance with a more progressive alternative. In the 1930s, Social
Security still faced attacks from left-wing critics like the [Congress
of Industrial
Organizations](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/77HrgPensions.pdf)
and [the populist Townsend
movement](https://www.ssa.gov/history/towns5.html). Social Security paid
higher benefits to higher-paid workers and relied on a payroll tax that
let the wealthiest pay a lower percentage of their income (a problem
that still exists today). Critics wanted equal benefits for all,
financed by a redistributive payroll tax.

To protect against this possibility, Altmeyer made getting public
assistance as unpleasant as he possibly could. States were told that
they could not receive federal money unless they conducted intrusive
investigations of every applicant, reducing benefits to those who
received food or shelter from family or friends. Programs that permitted
beneficiaries to work and save were told to adopt more restrictive
eligibility standards or be denied funding.

Inevitably, this sparked backlash. In 1940, the National Federation of
the Blind was founded to fight “the oppression of the social worker and
the arrogance of the governmental administrator.” It lobbied Congress to
let beneficiaries benefit from their labor, securing incremental
improvements.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Altmeyer’s vision remained largely intact. Public assistance
maintained an aggressive means test. When disability and aging programs
were federalized into the Supplemental Security Income program in 1971,
these restrictions came with them.

Today, economists [refer](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26041) to
Altmeyer’s strategy as an “ordeal” — a burden imposed on those receiving
benefits that yields no benefit to others. The purpose of an ordeal is
not to help the beneficiary or others in society. Instead, ordeals
deliberately make a program or service worse in order to discourage
people from using it.

Ordeals are a common attribute of programs serving the poor. Since
beneficiaries cannot be charged money they do not have, policymakers
impose a cost in time and suffering. Such indignities are designed to
weed out those who would rather go without than brave the bureaucratic
gantlet.

Ordeals are also typical in other disability programs: Medicaid’s [bias
in favor of institutional
care](https://readingroom.law.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2416&context=gsulr)
serves a similar purpose, deterring people from seeking services by
elevating institutions over higher-quality community supports. Even if
in-home care is less costly for most, institutions are prioritized since
many are willing to go without rather than place themselves or their
loved ones inside one. The program is deliberately made worse to
discourage use.

Ordeals likely do save some taxpayer money. But they impose tremendous
human cost. They are also only politically viable when imposed upon the
marginalized — more powerful constituencies are able to demand a higher
class of service from their government.

The Covid-19 pandemic exposed many middle-class Americans [to some of
the](https://www.theledger.com/news/20200706/state-feds-probe--jobless-benefits-system-mdash-but-who-will-fix-it)
[indignities in public
programs](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/lives-on-hold-covid-19-pandemic-exposes-failures-of-wisconsin-unemployment-insurance-system/article_96810941-894d-5bb9-9485-16912cb2be57.html)
[more typically relied upon by the
poor](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/from-our-experts/can-the-us-safety-net-handle-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-recession).
One hopes that this experience will spark empathy, an all too rare
phenomenon in American politics, and perhaps reform. In one promising
sign, Joe Biden recently proposed to increase S.S.I. benefits while
easing asset and income restrictions [in his campaign’s disability
plan](https://joebiden.com/disabilities/).

Still, ordeals will likely remain a common feature in both disability
and poverty policy well after the pandemic is over. As we enter the
A.D.A.’s fourth decade, challenging them will be one of the disability
rights movement’s most important tasks.
