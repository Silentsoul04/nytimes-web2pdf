Brett Kavanaugh [invoked
it](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/27/17911474/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-crying).
Mitch McConnell [used it
too](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/mcconnell-trump-must-apologize-for-repugnant-comments-229332).
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have [each talked about
it](https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/damon-affleck-father-of-daughters-excuse-harvey-weinstein.html),
and this week, Representative Ted Yoho joined their ranks: He, too, is
now a member of the having-a-daughter-makes-me-an-ally-to-women — or at
the very least, should-excuse-my-bad-behavior — club.

“Having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I’m very cognizant
of language,” Representative Yoho said in a speech on the House floor
this week, denying that he called Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman
Congresswoman from New York, a “fucking bitch” [after a confrontation on
the steps of the
Capitol](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/508259-ocaasio-cortez-accosted-by-gop-lawmaker-over-remarks-that-kind-of).

Mr. Yoho later expressed regret for the “abrupt manner of the
conversation,” in which he told Ms. Ocasio-Cortez that her statements
about poverty and crime in New York City were “disgusting.” But, he
noted, “I cannot apologize for my passion or for loving my God, my
family and my country.”

On Thursday, in [a speech on the House
floor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/politics/aoc-women-ted-yoho.html)
that has since gone viral — in which she read the vulgarity into the
Congressional record — Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said, “I am someone’s daughter
too.” She said she’d planned to ignore the insults — it’s “just another
day” as a woman, she said — but changed her mind after Mr. Yoho decided
to bring his wife and daughters into the fray.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Our culture is full of platitudes about fathers and daughters: the
Hallmark card, the weeping dad at the wedding. But invoking daughters
and wives to deflect criticism is a particular kind of political trope —
and one that’s been used throughout history to “excuse a host of bad
behavior,” said the historian Barbara Berg.

The love a man has for the female members of his family, particularly
his offspring, is presumed to have special power — to humanize the other
half of the population, to allow him to imagine the world his daughter
will inhabit. Sometimes, in fact, this happens. Other times, the
Daughter Excuse comes across mostly as cynical ploy.

“As if familial affiliation alone equals enlightened attitudes towards
women,” said Susan Douglas, a professor of communication and media at
the University of Michigan. “It’s like claiming ‘I have a Black friend‚’
as if that makes you anti-racist.”

There is social science that’s shown there is *something* to being the
father of a daughter.

In a study called “[The First-Daughter
Effect](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/82/3/493/5095700),”
Elizabeth Sharrow, an associate professor of public policy and history
at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and her colleagues,
determined that fathering daughters — and firstborn daughters, in
particular — indeed played a role in making men’s attitudes toward
gender equality more progressive, particularly when it came to policies
like equal pay or sexual harassment protocols. The researchers also
determined that those dads of firstborn daughters were, in 2016, more
likely to support Hillary Clinton or a fictional female congressional
candidate delivering a similar pitch.

“Our argument is not that it is genetics or biology, but that it is
proximity,” said Dr. Sharrow. In other words: The daughters help the
fathers see the problems they may have previously dismissed.

Witness basketball star[Stephen
Curry](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/09/14/yes-stephen-curry-is-right-having-a-daughter-does-change-fathers-political-outlooks-but-only-if-shes-the-firstborn/),
who has
[written](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/stephen-curry-womens-equality)
about how “the idea of women’s equality has become a little more
personal for me, lately, and a little more real,” since having a
daughter.

Or Dick Cheney, whose views on same-sex marriage shifted earlier than
many might have expected [because of his
daughter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/12/27/vice-looks-back-how-dick-cheneys-daughter-mary-shaped-his-views-same-sex-marriage/),
who is gay.

And yet.

Daughters influencing fathers’ views for the better is far different
from fathers using their daughters as “shields and excuses for poor
behavior,” as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez described Mr. Yoho in her speech.

It’s also different from fathers using them as “props,” as Dr. Berg puts
it, to emphasize their alignment with women’s causes — or, by contrast,
their disgust over behaviors perceived to be in opposition to them.

Consider Justice Kavanaugh, who — during his testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault by Christine
Blasey Ford — spoke repeatedly of his daughters (as well as his wife and
mother) and noted that coaching his daughter’s basketball team was what
he loved “more than anything I’ve ever done in my whole life” — as if
loving coaching and allegedly treating women badly as a teenager are
mutually exclusive.

“Men have often pointed to their relationships with and love for *some*
women — especially wives and daughters — to combat claims that they have
mistreated *other* women,” said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center
for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “We have seen
this both inside and outside of politics, especially when men are
subject to accusations of sexual harassment and assault.”

In the wake of the 2016 reports on comments made by Donald Trump on the
now-infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, a host of fathers-of-daughters
came out to condemn the behavior. Mr. McConnell noted that “as the
father of three daughters” he believed that Mr. Trump “needs to
apologize directly to women and girls everywhere,” while Mitt Romney
said that the comments “[demean our wives and
daughters](https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/784546373525966849).”
(It is perhaps worth noting that Mr. Trump, too, has daughters.)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Similarly, in response to revelations of sexual misconduct by Harvey
Weinstein, both Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who had worked with the
disgraced Hollywood producer, expressed their disgust on behalf of their
female offspring. We “need to do better at protecting our friends,
sisters, co-workers and daughters,” Mr. Affleck [said on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/BenAffleck/status/917787533802655744),
while Mr. Damon
[explained](https://deadline.com/2017/10/matt-damon-harvey-weinstein-russell-crowe-sexual-abuse-scandal-interview-1202185574/)
that “as the father of four daughters, this is the kind of sexual
predation that keeps me up at night.”

Women, too, have at times invoked men’s daughters — and other female
relatives — in trying to appeal to some men. When asked about Mr. Yoho’s
behavior, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
[said](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/aoc-speech-today-nancy-pelosi-ted-yoho-congress-floor-a9635191.html):
“What’s so funny is, you’d say to them, ‘Do you not have a daughter? Do
you not have a mother? Do you not have a sister? Do you not have a wife?
What makes you think that you can be so’ — and this is the word I use
for them — ‘condescending, in addition to being disrespectful?’”

The caveat, of course, is the qualification. “Qualifying your outrage
against misogyny as due to your role as a father or husband implies
that, absent those roles, you would be either unaware of or
unconcerned,” said Dr. Dittmar.

Or as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez put it: “Having a daughter does not make a man
decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with
dignity and respect makes a decent man.” Why should daughters still have
to be a prerequisite to respect?
