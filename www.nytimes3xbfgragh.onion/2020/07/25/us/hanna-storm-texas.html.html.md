CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Already battered by the coronavirus pandemic,
southeast Texas faced a new but no less frightening foe on Saturday, as
Hurricane Hanna slammed the coast with heavy rains and powerful winds.

Hanna strengthened from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane on
Saturday, becoming the first hurricane to hit the southern coastal
region of Texas since Hurricane Harvey struck the area in August 2017
and caused the worst rainstorm in United States history.

Hanna’s eye made landfall on Padre Island, about 60 miles north of the
U.S.-Mexico border, at about 5 p.m. on Saturday, with winds of 90 m.p.h.
As the National Weather Service
[warned](https://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=TXZ242&warncounty=TXC273&firewxzone=TXZ242&local_place1=3%20Miles%20NNE%20Kingsville,%20Naval%20Air%20Station%20TX&product1=Hurricane+Warning#.XxxWW55KjIV)
that the strong winds could peel roofs from homes, mangle trees and
cause power failures, mayors and local officials turned from one crisis
mode to another.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The cities and counties in the path of Hanna are some of the same
communities that have seen a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases and
hospitalizations as Texas has [become one of the largest hot spots in
the
country](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html).
In a state that is no stranger to bad weather, the typical
hurricane-prep ritual was altered by social distancing and face
coverings, with fever checks required to enter officials’ news briefings
and sandbag distribution provided by workers who covered their faces in
masks and
bandannas.

When natural disasters strike, swift and effective disaster response by
local, state and federal officials has always been difficult. The
pandemic has made it even harder.

“Hurricanes can be deadly events,” Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news
conference on Saturday afternoon. “We cannot allow this hurricane to
lead to a more catastrophically deadly event by stoking additional
spread of Covid-19.”

Mr. Abbott said he was issuing a disaster declaration for 32 counties.
Chief W. Nim Kidd of the Texas Division of Emergency Management said the
Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, usually used for concerts, rodeos and
other events, would be converted into a reception center for people who
had fled their homes. San Antonio officials were quick to make clear
that the arena was not serving as a shelter, but only as a location
where evacuees would be given vouchers to stay at hotels in the area.

It was another example of how social distancing is changing where, when
and how emergency shelters operate. Officials in California announced
recently that the coronavirus was affecting their wildfire preparations,
including by having fewer inmates available to assist because of
infections and quarantines. But there have been unexpected benefits,
too. In late March, a destructive tornado tore through Jonesboro, Ark.,
and the heart of its commercial district, but [not a single person
died](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/29/us/tornado-coronavirus-arkansas.html),
in part because businesses were closed and residents were already
sheltered at home from the virus.

As Hanna’s outer bands reached Nueces County, which includes Corpus

past seven days alone, officials<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>reminded residents fleeing low-lying areas to bring their face

“We’re riding two horses right now, so be sure to take care of what
keeps you safe through the Covid experience,” Mayor Joe McComb of Corpus
Christi said at a news conference on Friday. Moments later, a woman in a
mask and gloves carefully wiped down the podium to sanitize it before
the city manager stepped forward.

On Saturday, the mayor told reporters that people who had welcomed
friends or relatives into their homes to ride out the hurricane should
wear masks while indoors. “Wear the mask in the house,” Mr. McComb said.
“I know that probably sounds kind of crazy, but keeping safe sounds
pretty
good.”

The mayor’s message to the public on Saturday was simple: Keep doing
what you have been doing during the pandemic — stay at home.

“I know we’ve been staying at home for five months because of the
corona,” Mr. McComb said, adding, “And so staying home doesn’t sound
real popular, but right now this is a real important matter.”

The rise in cases in Nueces County was fueled, in part, by visitors from
Houston and elsewhere who [flocked to its
beaches](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/11/us/coronavirus-texas-corpus-christi.html)
when it had a low case count. More than 10,000 people in Nueces County
have [been infected with the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html).
At least 129 people have died, and 430 people were being treated in
hospitals on Friday, the highest total since the pandemic began.

By early Saturday evening, a storm surge slammed the city’s Art Museum
of South Texas, which faces the bay, drawing dozens of concerned
onlookers.

“They have art from all over the world,” said Andrew Gonzalez,
30,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>who used his cellphone to
record the rising waters splashing around the museum’s lower levels. “I
hope they removed all the art from the first floor to the upper floors
before the storm got here.”

Webb County, which includes the border city of Laredo and is about 150
miles inland from Corpus Christi, has [traditionally provided
shelter](https://www.lmtonline.com/local/article/City-officials-About-150-Hurricane-Harvey-11960437.php)
to people fleeing the Texas coast, as it did for hundreds of people
during the devastation that Harvey wrought along the coastline in 2017.

On Saturday, officials were grappling with how to handle a potential
influx of evacuees without worsening the spread of the coronavirus,
which has surged there in recent weeks. More than a quarter of Webb
County’s nearly 5,000 cases have come in just the past week, during
which 38 people died from the virus.

Tano E. Tijerina, the county executive, said that if evacuees came to
the area, officials would take their temperatures, provide them with
protective gear and try to separate people with virus symptoms from
those who appeared healthy.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We’re going to do whatever we can to help anyone, that’s with Covid or
without Covid,” Mr. Tijerina said. “We’re taking a risk, but we’re being
neighborly and we’re never going to turn people away.”

He said that schools, community centers and even the county fairgrounds
could serve as shelters if necessary. He said the daily coronavirus
reports were increasingly dire, with four or five people dying each
day.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated July 23, 2020

  - #### What is school going to look like in September?
    
      - It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal
        schedule this fall, requiring the grind of [online
        learning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        [makeshift child
        care](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        and [stunted
        workdays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        to continue. California’s two largest public school districts —
        Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13, that [instruction
        will be remote-only in the
        fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their
        areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together,
        the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the
        largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a
        partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in
        August. For other districts, the solution won’t be an
        all-or-nothing approach. [Many
        systems](https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/),
        including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising
        [hybrid
        plans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days
        online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with
        your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening
        in your community.

  - #### Is the coronavirus airborne?
    
      - The coronavirus [can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in
        stagnant
        air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq),
        infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence
        suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with
        poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events
        reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. [It’s
        unclear how often the virus is
        spread](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger
        droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes,
        or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said
        Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are
        released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or
        sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts,
        who [have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World
        Health
        Organization](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - Common symptoms [include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and
        difficulty breathing or shortness of
        breath.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/symptoms-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making
        detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less
        common. [The C.D.C. has
        also](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss
        of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most
        people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms
        may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.

  - #### What’s the best material for a mask?
    
      - Scientists around the country [have tried to identify everyday
        materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic
        particles.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)
        In recent tests, HEPA [furnace
        filters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html?action=click&action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage)
        scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to
        flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other
        materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and
        bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small
        percentage of particles.

  - #### Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
    
      - So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited
        [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5)
        published in April suggests that people are most infectious
        about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and
        estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of
        transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms.
        Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated
        that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have
        symptoms was “very rare,” [but she later walked back that
        statement.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/world/coronavirus-updates.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-coronavirus-national&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-1f302e21)

“We’re going to get through it — it’s just a matter of how,” Mr.
Tijerina said of the dual threat of the virus and the hurricane.

Hanna, in some ways, provided echoes of its destructive predecessor,
Hurricane Harvey.

Hanna was set to strike to the south of Corpus Christi; Harvey hit to
the northeast, near the bay town of Rockport. Hanna was expected to make
landfall on Saturday, exactly one month before the third anniversary of
Harvey, which first hit Rockport on Aug. 25,
2017.

Harvey was one of the worst disasters in American history, causing $125
billion in damage in Texas with winds at 130 m.p.h. and record-breaking
flooding. More than 100 people died [directly and
indirectly](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL092017_Harvey.pdf) from
Harvey, officials said. More than a quarter of a million homes were
damaged and another nearly 16,000 were destroyed.

Hanna was not expected to be nearly as devastating, but the unease grew
as the hurricane gathered strength on Saturday.

Corpus Christi residents who live on the coastline of scenic Whitecap
Beach kept a watchful eye on the swelling sea waters threatening their
condominiums. On Saturday afternoon, a woman on the beach fought the
full force of the wind to take a photograph of the rising tide, but
quickly turned around when the water rose to her waist. Other residents
nervously watched from a boardwalk, and waited.

“These are pretty impressive, aggressive waves,” said Zack Smith, 36, as
he tried to stand still. “Once they start reaching my feet, then I’ll
leave. I don’t want to get hit by one of those and get washed out.”

The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for a swath of
Texas coast that spanned nearly 100 miles, from Port Mansfield to Port
Aransas. A storm surge warning reached even farther north, to about 75
miles south of Houston.

In addition to the wind, forecasters with the hurricane center said the
storm would bring up to a foot of rain over the weekend, with some
isolated areas getting up to 18 inches. The sudden downpour could lead
to “life-threatening flash flooding,” they said. Tornadoes could also
pose a threat on Saturday and overnight into Sunday over parts of the
coast.

“There could be damage to buildings and structures, especially if there
are any tornadoes,” said Brian Field, a forecaster at the National
Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.

Hanna is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which
runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. In the Pacific Ocean, a Category 3
hurricane continued to churn toward Hawaii, although forecasters said
that hurricane, named Douglas, was likely to weaken significantly as it
got closer to the islands.

Edgar Sandoval reported from Corpus Christi, Texas, Nicholas
Bogel-Burroughs from New York and Manny Fernandez from Houston. Derrick
Bryson Taylor contributed reporting from New York and Marie Fazio from
Jacksonville, Fla.
