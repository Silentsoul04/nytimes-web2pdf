<div class="css-53u6y8">

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Congress’s attention will turn briefly to
another matter: world domination. On Wednesday, the chief executives of
Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, will
appear together to defend themselves in a continuing inquiry into their
market power by the congressional subcommittee focused on antitrust.

The virus’s reach means [Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jeff Bezos of
Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of
Alphabet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony)
will dial into the hearing via video chat, avoiding the glare of
photographers, members of Congress and the gallery as they are peppered
with questions. While in their home offices, the men also could receive
messages from aides about how to respond.

Nonetheless, the one-day hearing, conducted by the House Judiciary
Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, could give the public a rare glimpse
into the inner workings of some of the world’s most valuable companies.
Panel members are likely to turn a good deal of attention to Mr. Bezos,
the world’s wealthiest person, in part because he’s never appeared
before Congress. (He initially [tried to avoid
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/technology/jeff-bezos-amazon-testimony-congress.html)
this time.)

The challenge for the subcommittee will be in establishing whether these
tech companies — which have amassed immeasurable power — operate as
illegal monopolies in certain domains, such as online search (Google),
online marketplaces (Amazon), mobile phone app stores (Apple), the
dissemination of information (Facebook), advertising sales (Google and
Facebook) and mergers and acquisitions.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s not against the law to be the largest search engine, online
marketplace or social media network. But antitrust laws, meant to
protect against outsize market power, do not allow companies to suppress
competition — a practice known as [exclusionary
conduct](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/single-firm-conduct/monopolization-defined)
— by, for instance, quashing or gobbling up potential rivals. Freed from
competition, companies may also cross the line by squeezing suppliers or
imposing higher prices on consumers.

Wednesday’s hearing will be the culmination of a roughly yearlong
investigation into the businesses’ operations and is likely to be the
final public forum before the subcommittee releases its findings,
expected in the fall.

Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the
subcommittee’s chairman, has indicated the tech companies may not like
the results, this month calling the companies’ power
[“terrifying.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/opinion/anti-trust-tech-hearing-facebook.html)

It’s up to the subcommittee to help the public understand the breadth of
the companies’ power and, potentially, to recommend that regulators
break them up or take other action. Also at issue is determining if
existing rules are sufficient given the tech companies’ market power and
whether the laws should be updated because the companies behave in ways
that should be illegal.  
  
Here are some questions subcommittee members ought to consider:

### Amazon

The subcommittee will probably focus on the company’s relationship with
third-party merchants that use the site to sell directly to consumers.
Such merchants represent about 60 percent of Amazon’s sales. The company
also operates an enormous shipping network, an advertising sales
business and a cloud computing service that may raise alarms among
regulators. Amazon’s trove of sales data gives it incredibly detailed
insights into both customers and merchants.

  - After an [investigation by German
    regulators](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/17/amazon-in-deal-with-german-watchdog-to-overhaul-marketplace-terms.html),
    Amazon vowed last year to overhaul its contracts with third-party
    merchants. Did the company adequately do so? Does Amazon have
    contracts that require lower prices than other retailers’? Does it
    require exclusivity, meaning merchants cannot offer their goods on
    other sellers’ websites?

<!-- end list -->

  - An Amazon lawyer told the panel, “We don’t use individual seller
    data directly to compete” with other businesses on Amazon’s site.
    But a Wall Street Journal
    [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015)
    showed evidence that Amazon does just that, helping it create
    tailored private-label products that undercut competitors. What is
    the extent of Amazon’s use of seller data?

<!-- end list -->

  - Amazon offers its sellers warehousing and shipping services
    worldwide. What does it seek in return, beyond a commission? Does
    Amazon use sales data from small merchants to source new products or
    to help larger sellers succeed, forcing out [smaller
    ones](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2019/07/16/amazon-faces-antitrust-probe-business-practices-european-union/1742868001/)?

<!-- end list -->

  - In 2010, Amazon [dropped diaper
    prices](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/10/10/amazon_book_how_jeff_bezos_went_thermonuclear_on_diapers_com.html/)
    well below profitability, in a successful effort to force a
    competitor, Diapers.com, into acquisition talks. Amazon has since
    shuttered that site. Does Amazon view such actions as exclusionary?
    And is the company engaged in other such pricing wars in order to
    force a competitor to sell?

<!-- end list -->

  - A Washington Post
    [investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/27/aggressive-amazon-tactic-pushes-you-consider-its-own-brand-before-you-click-buy/)
    showed that Amazon pushes consumers toward its private-label
    products even when they appear to want to buy name brands. Does
    Amazon favor its own products in consumers’ searches? Does it
    require fees or advertising purchases from merchants or brands to
    ensure their products rise to the top of searches?

### Apple

While Apple is best known for its iPhones and laptops, it also has
healthy competition from companies like Samsung and Lenovo in hardware
sales. As a result, Mr. Cook is most likely to be asked about the
structure of Apple’s App Store, where millions of software developers
offer their apps for download.

  - Why does Apple permit only its own app store on iPhones?

<!-- end list -->

  - Developers are generally required to offer their in-app purchases
    and paid subscriptions through Apple’s App Store, rather than on
    their own websites, where they may avoid Apple’s commissions. Apple
    has [threatened to remove
    apps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/opinion/apple-app-store-hey.html)
    that don’t abide. How is this in the best interest of consumers and
    app developers?

<!-- end list -->

  - Some app developers have alleged that Apple uses the detailed data
    it collects about app downloads to [copy their
    ideas](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/06/developers-talk-about-being-sherlocked-as-apple-uses-them-for-market-research)
    and that the company [favors its own
    apps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/09/09/technology/apple-app-store-competition.html)
    in searches. Is this true? If so, how does the company defend such
    practices?

### Facebook

Facebook’s aggressive acquisition strategy — including the giants
Instagram and WhatsApp — makes it vulnerable to a breakup if regulators
find that it was trying to rid the market of real
    competition.

  - [Reportedly](https://nypost.com/2019/02/26/facebook-boasted-of-buying-instagram-to-kill-the-competition-sources/),
    the Federal Trade Commission had documents demonstrating Facebook
    acquired Instagram in 2012 in an explicit bid to stifle a
    competitor. Were those documents mischaracterized? How did
    Facebook’s buying Instagram benefit consumers, and how did it
    determine the [$1 billion
    price](https://dealbook.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/)?

<!-- end list -->

  - British lawmakers [released
    emails](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/05/technology/facebook-emails-privacy-data.html)
    showing Facebook used an analytics app to collect detailed data
    about competitors in order to snuff them out. That helped Facebook
    decide to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion, the emails show. Couldn’t
    that be called an abuse of market power? Does Facebook still cull
    proprietary data on rivals in order to protect its market
    leadership?

  - Advertisers can target customers on Facebook with incredible
    accuracy, in part because of the platform’s ability to track users’
    internet browsing activity across the web. Shouldn’t users consider
    those terms onerous? Also, has Facebook made assurances about the
    privacy of customer data that it later reneged on? What assurances
    do consumers have that their data will remain private and not be
    repurposed for Facebook’s benefit?

<!-- end list -->

  - [According to The Wall Street
    Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499),
    Facebook quashed efforts to make its site less politically divisive
    because partisan content drives more use of the site, which is
    beneficial to its advertising business. How can suppressing opposing
    views for users be viewed as anything but an abuse of power?

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### Alphabet

Alphabet’s signature product, Google, is central to nearly every
activity on the web — and increasingly, many activities off the web as
well. It is the dominant search engine by far and operates sprawling
advertising and cloud computing businesses. Subcommittee members are
likely to home in on how Google’s search business potentially stifles
competition by favoring its own services and how YouTube, a Google
subsidiary, pushes content to users.

  - Frequently, answers to common Google search questions can be found
    in so-called answer boxes at the top of a results page. Google culls
    that information from other websites, eliminating the need for users
    to visit those sites. Doesn’t that starve other websites of valuable
    traffic? Don’t answer boxes simply buttress Google’s market
    leadership by stifling competitors?

<!-- end list -->

  - Google has paid Apple [billions of
    dollars](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310591/apple-google-search-engine-safari-iphone-deal-billions-regulation-antitrust)
    to be the default search engine on the Safari web browser on iPhones
    and iPads. How does Google expect rivals to compete on an even
    playing field if it has cornered such a significant share of the
    market?

<!-- end list -->

  - Google controls multiple levers in the process of placing
    advertisements on the web, including analytics. The company also
    requires some businesses to use its ad technology if they want to
    use Google services. How does Google’s ad sales technology benefit
    advertisers? Why doesn’t Google allow marketers to see what prices
    others pay to place ads? Doesn’t that stifle bargaining power?

<!-- end list -->

  - Critics say YouTube [pushes
    videos](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/technology/google-ads-antitrust.html)
    that are politically slanted, based on data about its users, meaning
    viewers aren’t likely to see competing viewpoints. Is it correct
    that YouTube’s software is designed to reinforce biases? Other than
    keeping users on YouTube longer, what is the purpose of that system?
