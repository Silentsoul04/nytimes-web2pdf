\section{Trump Again Assails Mail-In
Voting}\label{trump-again-assails-mail-in-voting}}

The president has been raging against voting by mail for several months,
claiming without evidence that the process is plagued by fraud.

WASHINGTON --- In his latest assault on voting by mail,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-postal-service-mail-voting.html}{President
Trump} said on Monday that he thought the Democratic primary in New
York's 12th Congressional District should be rerun because of lengthy
delays in counting
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/31/us/politics/vote-by-mail-deadlines.html}{mail-in
ballots}.

Prompted by a question at an afternoon news conference, Mr. Trump also
claimed that he had the right to take executive action to stop the
broader use of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/politics/mail-in-voting-foreign-intervention.html}{mail-in
ballots} nationwide, but he said, ``We haven't gotten there yet.'' He
offered no details on what authority he would cite to override state
laws that allowed mail-in voting.

The president has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/us/politics/trump-vote-by-mail.html}{raging
against voting by mail} for several months,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html}{claiming
without evidence} that the process is
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-mail-voting-fraud.html}{plagued
by fraud} and insisting that the broader use of mail-in ballots because
of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{coronavirus
pandemic} will corrupt the 2020 presidential election. ``Universal
mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country,''
he said.

Hours earlier, Mr. Trump
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1290250416278532096?s=20}{had
written on Twitter}, ``See you in Court!'' --- referring to Nevada's
governor, who is expected to sign a bill passed by the state's
Legislature over the weekend that would allow universal mail-in
balloting.

On Monday evening, the president focused his attention on the New York
Democratic primary, in which large numbers of voters mailed their
ballots to avoid standing in lines at crowded polling places for the
June 23 primary, where Representative Carolyn B. Maloney was facing
Suraj Patel. Nearly six weeks later,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-mail-ballots-voting.html}{all
of the ballots have yet to be counted}, a fact that Mr. Trump said
proved that his critique about mail-in balloting was correct.

``If you look at the New York congressional race, which is a disaster,''
Mr. Trump said, adding: ``They're six weeks into it now. They have no
clue what's going on. And I mean, I think I can say right here, and now
I think you have to rerun that race, because it's a mess. Nobody knows
what's happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the
fraudulent ballots, I guess.''

There is no evidence that the New York primary results were tainted by
criminal malfeasance, according to a wide array of election officials
and campaign representatives. Still, candidates and political analysts
are warning that government officials at all levels need to take urgent
action to avoid a nightmare in November.

``This election is a canary in the coal mine,'' Mr. Patel said. Results
show him trailing Ms. Maloney by about 3,700 votes in a race in which
about 12,000 votes were disqualified. Mr. Patel has filed a federal
lawsuit over the primary.

Other states and localities recently held vote-by-mail primaries, with
some scattered reports of problems, though nothing on the scale of New
York City's weekslong process. With mail-in voting expected to surge
around the country in the general election because of the pandemic, New
York's delays could soon be mirrored elsewhere.

Mr. Trump's critics have pointed out that he is taking steps to
undermine the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-postal-service-mail-voting.html}{Postal
Service}, potentially worsening the very problems that he cites with
mail-in ballots.
