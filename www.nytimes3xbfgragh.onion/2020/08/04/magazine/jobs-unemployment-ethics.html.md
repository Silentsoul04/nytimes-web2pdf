*Last year I was abruptly let go from my job. I ramped up my side
business, which was fine except that now the pandemic has caused an
immediate decline — and potential future decrease — in business because
my clients cannot quickly adapt to technology to allow for work to
continue. My clients requested that I reschedule work until the fall of
this year; they think that is when business will return to pre-crisis
levels. (This is an industrywide issue as well.)*

*The trouble is that I never told my elderly parents that I was let go.
I no longer talk about the job, a topic we used to discuss frequently.
Now I discourage discussion about it, saying it is a “toxic work
environment.” Instead, I steer the discussion toward small triumphs with
my side job, which is now my primary source of income. During this
economic turbulence caused by the pandemic, both parents often verbalize
how blessed our family is that all of their children are still employed.
I continue to play along because I don’t want my octogenarian parents
worrying about it.*

*I have not shared the news with my family because I am hurt and
embarrassed by the circumstances of my departure from the job. I am
considering taking legal action to address what I believe to be
disparate treatment. I feel as if discussing this matter will be a
“downer” for everyone at a time when we all crave good news. I believe
that I have good reasons for not sharing my job loss with my parents,
who tend to share details I would rather keep private.* *Still, I think
I behaved unethically by not fully sharing my situation with them. What
do you think?* Name Withheld

**It’s a sign** of something morally odd about our attitude to
employment that you feel ashamed of having been fired, even though you
think the firing was unjust. (You say “embarrassed,” but that’s usually
a gentler way of saying the same thing.) If you’re right, the shame
should attach not to you but to the people who fired you. And yet your
response is entirely representative. People tend to think that having a
job gives them a kind of moral standing, marks them out as a
contributor, a giver and not a taker.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I’m tempted to say that this is a very American idea. Benjamin Franklin,
in his autobiography, wrote of his “bold and arduous project of arriving
at moral perfection,” which involved such maxims as “Industry: Lose no
time; be always employ’d in something useful; cut off all unnecessary
actions.” (Max Weber later cited Franklin’s cherishing of industry as
evidence for what he called the Protestant ethic.) But then I think of
the French film “Time Out” and the Japanese film “Tokyo Sonata,” each of
which memorably depicts a fired white-collar worker whose family thinks
he is still going to the office. The workplace as a source of worth is a
widespread tenet. So I can see why you wanted to keep this from your
parents. Losing your job — a condition that the pandemic has now visited
upon tens of millions of Americans — imposes harms beyond the financial
ones.

You understandably don’t want your folks to worry, and you might well
feel that it is up to you whether you disclose what happened. Family
relationships don’t require frankness about everything. They may, on the
contrary, require discretion about certain things. But deceiving your
parents about your employment status is wrong, a pattern of deception
that isn’t in keeping with a loving relationship. You should end the
charade before your parents learn the truth from someone else and are
left feeling betrayed. It won’t be easy, I realize. Letting them know
that you haven’t been honest with them is bound to be a source of shame
— this time
justified.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

**I just mentioned** the concern many people have to be a giver, not a
taker, and that’s clearly one that you share. Unemployment payments are
a legal right for those who qualify, which doesn’t mean you have to
exercise the right. But it isn’t incidental that, like Social Security,
the program of unemployment insurance to which you would be applying is
not means-tested. There may be political advantages to that design: In a
society like ours, benefits that aren’t means-tested tend to garner more
support and carry less stigma. In our present economic circumstances,
too, we don’t want people to cut back on spending, and your unemployment
pay will reduce the temptation to do so.

Of course, your particular decision will not make much difference to the
world: Not taking these benefits will save the government an amount
that’s well within the rounding error of the budget, and spending it
won’t increase demand detectably. (At least not in the aggregate: I
suppose it might make a detectable difference for a small neighborhood
store you patronize regularly.) But there’s nothing wrong about taking
part in a basically just system in ways permitted by its rules.

*I am Jewish by birth, upbringing and culture but consider myself an
agnostic. Questions about the existence of God have no interest for me,
and my religious observance is more family- than God-oriented. In this
period of intense suffering and loss, though, I’ve struggled with how to
honestly express feelings of hope and sorrow. “You’re in my heart” or “I
hope your loved one gets better” just doesn’t seem to carry the same
weight as “I’m praying for you” — and recently, I’ve found myself saying
that to people I know who are deeply religious, even though I don’t
literally pray. I don’t want to be facile or deceptive, but it is what
people say in our country. If the other person has already spoken about
God’s will, is responding in their lingua franca a sign of empathy or a
kind of appropriation?* Jezra Kaye, New York

**Not every use** of religious language signals religious commitment. An
atheist can say “Bless you” when someone sneezes; it’s just a
conventional formula. The same is true of “goodbye,” said at parting,
even though it’s an abbreviation of “God be with you.” When people leave
my presence in Asante, the region of Ghana where I grew up, I often say
“Wo ne Nyame nko,” which literally means “Go with God.” (It’s more
traditional than the alternative, which is an Asantified version of
“bye-bye,” namely “Baabae-o.”) I’m pretty sure I’m not misleading
anyone. “I’m praying for you” could, against a certain cultural
background, be formulaic in just this way.

But what if “I’m praying for you” brings someone consolation not just by
expressing compassion and concern but by suggesting, falsely, that you
are actually praying? Perhaps religious people would be especially prone
to mistake your parrotings for promises. What’s at stake, in these
circumstances, isn’t appropriation but deception. Nor is this a white
lie, a trivial fib meant to spare someone’s feelings. The act depends
upon deceiving listeners about something that is — from their point of
view, if not yours — genuinely important. Like many attempts at
