# Poor and Desperate, Pakistani Hindus Accept Islam to Get By

Drawn by jobs or land offered by Muslim groups, some Hindus, facing
discrimination and a virus-ravaged economy, are essentially converting
to survive.

The Hindus performed the prayer rituals awkwardly in supplication to
their new, single god, as they prepared to leave their many deities
behind them. Their lips stumbled over Arabic phrases that, once recited,
would seal their conversion to Islam. The last words uttered, the men
and boys were then circumcised.

Dozens of Hindu families converted in June in the Badin district of
Sindh Province in southern Pakistan. Video clips of the ceremony went
viral across the country, delighting hard-line Muslims and weighing on
Pakistan’s dwindling Hindu minority.

The mass ceremony was the latest in what is a growing number of such
conversions to Pakistan’s majority Muslim faith in recent years —
although precise data is scarce. Some of these conversions are
voluntary, some not.

News outlets in India, Pakistan’s majority-Hindu neighbor and archrival,
were quick to denounce the conversions as forced. But what is happening
is more subtle. Desperation, religious and political leaders on both
sides of the debate say, has often been the driving force behind their
change of religion.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Treated as second-class citizens, the Hindus of Pakistan are often
systemically discriminated against in every walk of life — housing,
jobs, access to government welfare. While minorities have long been
drawn to convert in order to join the majority and escape discrimination
and sectarian violence, Hindu community leaders say that the recent
uptick in conversions has also been motivated by newfound economic
pressures.

“What we are seeking is social status, nothing else,” said Muhammad
Aslam Sheikh, whose name was Sawan Bheel until June, when he converted
in Badin with his family. The ceremony in Badin was notable for its
size, involving just over 100 people.

“These conversions,” he added, “are becoming very common in poor Hindu
communities.”

Proselytizing Muslim clerics and charity groups add to the faith’s
allure, offering incentives of jobs or land to impoverished minority
members only if they convert.

With Pakistan’s economy [on the brink of collapse in the wake of the
coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/world/asia/pakistan-coronavirus-hospitals.html),
the pressures on the country’s minorities, often its poorest people,
have increased. The economy will contract by 1.3 percent in the 2020
fiscal year because of the pandemic, the World Bank predicts. And up to
18 million of Pakistan’s 74 million jobs may be lost.

Mr. Sheikh and his family hope to find financial support from wealthy
Muslims or from Islamic charities that have cropped up in recent years,
which focus on drawing more people to Islam.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“There is nothing wrong with that,” Mr. Sheikh said. “Everyone helps the
people of their faith.”

As Mr. Sheikh sees it, there is nothing left for Pakistan’s more
affluent Hindus to give to help the people of their own faith. That is
because there are so few Hindus left.

At independence in 1947, [Hindus composed 20.5 percent of the
population](https://theprint.in/opinion/modi-critics-decry-india-mistreating-minorities-but-cant-whitewash-pak-islamisation/355536/)
of the areas that now form Pakistan. In the following decades, the
percentage shrank rapidly, and by 1998 — the last government census to
classify people by religion — Hindus were just 1.6 percent of Pakistan’s
population. Most estimates say it has further dwindled in the past two
decades.

Once a melting pot of religions, Sindh Province, where the conversion
ceremony took place, has seen minority members flee to other countries
in droves in recent decades. Many face harsh discrimination, as well as
the specter of violence — and the risk of being accused of blasphemy, a
capital crime — if they speak out against
it.

Ms. Ispahani recalled the devastating floods of 2010 in Sindh Province,
which left thousands homeless and with little to eat. Hindus were not
allowed to sit with Muslims at soup kitchens, she said. And when
government aid was handed out, Hindus received less of it than their
Muslim peers did, she said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Will they be converting with their hearts and souls?” Ms. Ispahani
said. “I don’t think so.”

The further economic devastation caused by the pandemic may spur more
sectarian violence, and that may intensify the pressure on minorities to
convert, Ms. Ispahani and others worry.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Murtaza Wahab, an adviser to the chief minister of Sindh, was among
several government officials who said they could not address Ms.
Ispahani’s accusation that Hindus received less aid after the floods, as
it happened before they took office.

“The Hindu community is an important part of our society and we believe
that people from all faiths should live together without issue,” Mr.
Wahab said.

[Forced
conversions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/03/26/world/asia/pakistani-hindus-say-womans-conversion-to-islam-was-coerced.html)
of Hindu girls and women to Islam through kidnapping and coerced
marriages occur throughout Pakistan. But Hindu rights groups are also
troubled by the seemingly voluntary conversions, saying they take place
under such economic duress that they are tantamount to a forced
conversion anyway.

“Overall, religious minorities do not feel safe in Pakistan,” said Lal
Chand Mahli, a Pakistani Hindu lawmaker with the ruling party, who is a
member of a parliamentary committee to protect minorities from forced
conversions. “But poor Hindus are the most vulnerable among them. They
are extremely poor and illiterate, and Muslim mosques, charities and
traders exploit them easily and lure them to convert to Islam. A lot of
money is involved in it.”

Clerics like Muhammad Naeem were at the forefront of an effort to
convert more Hindus. (Mr. Naeem, who was 62, died of cardiac arrest two
weeks after he was interviewed in June).

Mr. Naeem said he had overseen more than 450 conversions over the past
two years at Jamia Binoria, his seminary in Karachi. Most of the
converts were low-caste Hindus from Sindh Province, he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We have not been forcing them to convert,” Mr. Naeem said. “In fact,
people come to us because they want to escape discrimination attached
with their caste and change their socioeconomic status.”

Demand was so great, he added, that his seminary had set up a separate
department to guide the new converts and provide counsel in legal or
financial
matters.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

On a recent afternoon, the call to prayer echoed through a cluster of
newly erected tents in Matli, a barren patch of Sindh. A group of
Karachi’s wealthy Muslim merchants bought the land last year for dozens
of families who had converted from Hinduism.

At a new mosque adjacent to the tents, Muhammad Ali — who was known by
his Hindu name, Rajesh, before converting last year alongside 205 others
— performed ablutions before praying.

Last year, his entire family had decided to convert to Islam when Mr.
Naeem, the cleric, offered to free them from the bonded labor in which
they were trapped, living and working as indentured servants because of
unpaid debt. Mr. Ali is originally from the Bheel caste, one of the
lowest in Hinduism.

“We have found a sense of equality and brotherhood in Islam, and
therefore we converted to it,” Mr. Ali
said.

Lower-caste Pakistani Hindus are often the victims of bonded labor. It
was outlawed in 1992, but the practice is still prevalent. The Global
Slavery Index [estimates that just over three million
Pakistanis](https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/data/maps/#prevalence)
live in debt servitude.

Landlords trap poor Hindus into such bondage by providing loans that
they know can never be repaid. They and their families are then forced
to work off the debt. The women are often sexually abused, rights groups
say.

Mr. Naeem’s seminary had rescued several Hindus — including Mr. Ali and
his family — from bonded labor by paying off their debts in exchange for
their conversions to Islam.

When Mr. Ali and his family converted, Mr. Naeem and a group of rich
Muslim traders had given them a piece of land and helped them find work,
considering it an Islamic responsibility to help them.

“Those who make efforts to spread the message and bring the non-Muslims
into the fold of Islam will be blessed in the hereafter,” Mr. Naeem
said.
