The mayor is sending the sheriff to city bridges and tunnels to try to

The announcement by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday seemed to signal a
new crackdown in the city’s efforts to curb the spread of the
coronavirus: “Traveler registration checkpoints” would be set up at
bridges and tunnels, conjuring images of police officers stopping cars
and detaining people from out of state.

The reality may be a lot less stark — and a lot more confusing.

The authorities will not be stopping every car. They will likely not be
at every crossing on any given day. The Police Department won’t even be
involved.

Instead of working to enforce the state’s [mandatory
quarantine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/nyregion/coronavirus-quarantine-nyc.html)
for people coming from states with climbing coronavirus cases, the
checkpoints, run by the city’s sheriff’s office, will focus on informing
[travelers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/us/california-travel-restrictions-covid-19.html)
about the rules.

Even so, Mayor de Blasio presented the program as a crucial step in
fending off the resurgence of the virus in the city, which was once the
center of the pandemic but has maintained a low rate of infection in
recent weeks.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If we’re going to hold at this level of health and safety in the city
and get better, we have to deal with the fact that the quarantine must
be applied consistently to anyone who has traveled,” Mr. de Blasio said
at a news conference.

Hours after the mayor’s announcement, many details of the checkpoint
program remained unclear — including to the region’s transit agencies,
who oversee the city’s bridges and tunnels.

A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which
operates crossings into the city, said that the mayor’s announcement
surprised the agency. The spokesman did not know whether any of its
bridges or tunnels would be targeted and had no details of the
plan.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates bridges and
tunnels within the city, said it was not involved with the checkpoints.

Laura Feyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said that the city would
most likely not provide advance notice of where the checkpoints would be
so that motorists did not try to route around them.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Most checkpoints will be at roadways coming into the city after bridges
and tunnels, not on Port Authority property themselves,” Ms. Feyer said.

State and city officials have been warning for weeks about a [potential
second wave of virus
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-travel-cuomo.html?module=inline)
driven by travelers from the dozens of states where the outbreak has
surged in recent weeks.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

In late June, as cases began climbing around the country, New York’s
governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, ordered people coming from states with a high
percentage of positive coronavirus tests to [quarantine for two
weeks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-states-quarantine.html?module=inline)
upon their arrival. As of Tuesday, [travelers from 34 states and Puerto
Rico](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory) are
subject to the order.

From the day of its announcement, the measure was met with skepticism
about how it could be enforced. Those who violate the quarantine can be
subject to fines of up to $10,000 for subsequent violations, but state
officials acknowledged that they would not be tracking every person who
entered the state.

To boost compliance, the state last month began [requiring people
disembarking at New York’s
airports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-travel-cuomo.html)
to fill out a form with their personal information and recent
whereabouts or face a $2,000 fine.

Though the state says all travelers should fill out the form, compliance
has largely depended on the whims of the people entering the state.
Those who entered New York using highways, train stations and buses had
not been subject to the same level of scrutiny.

City officials said on Wednesday that the checkpoints will help them
monitor potential new outbreaks. They had grown particularly concerned
amid an [uptick in cases in neighboring New
Jersey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/nyregion/coronavirus-cases-nj.html?module=inline)
and regional partners like Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ted Long, the executive director of the city’s testing and
contact-tracing program, said New York was moved to act after recent
data suggested a fifth of the city’s new coronavirus cases were
attributed to travelers entering New York City from other states.

The city’s sheriff, Joseph Fucito, said that deputies would stop cars on
a random basis. The traffic stops will not target drivers with
out-of-state license plates — as [officials in Rhode Island did in
March](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/28/us/coronavirus-rhode-island-checkpoint.html?module=inline),
much to the chagrin of New York officials.

The deputies will then ask drivers coming from designated states to fill
out the required forms and provide them with details about the state’s
quarantine rules, officials said. The sheriff’s office cannot force
travelers to comply with the quarantine, and it is unclear if or how the
city would track whether they comply.

The sheriff’s office has been increasingly involved in enforcing
social-distancing guidelines, including at the city’s restaurants and
bars.

The checkpoints arrive during a time of vociferous debate over the role
of law enforcement in the city.

Albert Fox Cahn, a New York lawyer who runs the Surveillance Technology
Oversight Project, a privacy advocacy group, said in a statement that
the plan created privacy risks with no clear benefit.

“The mayor is transforming this pandemic into a policing issue,” Mr.
Cahn said.

Both the sheriff and the mayor said that travelers’ individual rights
and civil liberties would be respected. Ms. Feyer said that sheriff’s
deputies would not issue summons for other legal violations except
“under extreme circumstances.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, also faced criticism from some Republican
elected officials, including Councilman Joseph Borelli of Staten Island,
who said the checkpoints were unlikely to be effective and amounted to
“theatrics.”

In addition to the checkpoints at bridges and tunnels, the city will
also set up similar efforts at Penn Station, starting on Thursday, and
at the Port Authority Bus Terminal to inform out-of-state travelers
about the mandatory quarantine.

Juliana Kim and Dana Rubinstein contributed reporting.
