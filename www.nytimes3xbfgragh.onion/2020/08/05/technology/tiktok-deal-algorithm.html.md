# Is TikTok a Good Buy? It Depends on What’s Included

</div>

TikTok’s most valuable assets, a hyper-effective algorithm and a
community of popular creators, may not be as easy to acquire as the
company itself.

TikTok is going to get acquired or die trying.

The hit video app appears headed for a shotgun wedding after President
Trump has decided to [force its
owner](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/tiktok-bytedance-us-china.html),
the Chinese tech conglomerate ByteDance, to sell
[TikTok](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/technology/trump-oracle-tiktok.html)
to an American acquirer or be barred from operating in the country. On
Monday, the president — acting as a combination of investment banker,
regulator, and back-room mafioso — [said he would approve a
bid](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html)
by Microsoft for TikTok’s U.S. operations, provided that both parties
meet his as-yet-unspecified demands and hit a Sept. 15 deadline.

There are a million questions still swirling around a possible
TikTok-Microsoft deal. But the most glaring question mark is that nobody
I’ve talked to has figured out exactly what “buying TikTok” will mean,
or whether what many experts consider TikTok’s golden goose — the
complex algorithms that make the app so addictive — would be included in
a deal.

A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment. A TikTok spokeswoman, Ashley
Nash-Hahn, declined to offer details about what parts of TikTok’s
technology were and weren’t up for sale.

“While we do not comment on rumors or speculation, we are confident in
the long-term success of TikTok,” she said in an emailed statement.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some corporate acquisitions are straightforward. In the simplest kind of
deal — say, a big restaurant buying a smaller restaurant — the acquirer
buys everything on the other company’s balance sheet: all its assets and
liabilities, including its kitchen equipment, its secret recipes, and
any real estate it owns. Lawyers and bankers try to place a value on
those things, and estimate the company’s future cash flows. Then they
hash out terms, negotiate a price and sign a deal.

A TikTok acquisition is far, far more complicated.

For starters, even though TikTok has gone to great lengths to distance
itself from its Chinese parent company, the app is still very tightly
integrated with ByteDance’s Chinese operations. As [The Information
recently
reported](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/breaking-off-tiktok-will-be-hard-to-do),
most of TikTok’s core features were developed by ByteDance’s Chinese
engineers using a suite of shared software tools — known as “zhongtai,”
or “central platform” — that is available to all of ByteDance’s more
than two dozen apps. And most of the important decisions about TikTok’s
operations and strategy have been made by executives in China.

Separating TikTok from ByteDance would, by definition, require
untangling many of these Chinese connections. That could present
problems. Many of TikTok’s top American executives — including Kevin
Mayer, its chief executive — are new to the company, and presumably
still getting up to speed. And while TikTok does have engineers based in
the United States who could theoretically help with the technical
untangling, many of the engineers with the deepest knowledge of TikTok’s
systems are presumably Chinese nationals in Beijing.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And what about the algorithm? By all accounts, TikTok’s core algorithm —
which selects videos for the central feed users see when they open the
app, called the “for you page” or FYP — could be the most valuable asset
the company owns. Eugene Wei, a longtime tech executive and blogger,
likens TikTok’s FYP algorithm to [the Sorting
Hat](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat)
from the Harry Potter series — a “rapid, hyper-efficient matchmaker”
that analyzes users’ behavior and places them into personalized niches,
based on their interests.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The FYP algorithm is TikTok’s secret sauce, and a big part of what makes
it so accurate is ByteDance’s global reach. Every swipe, tap and video
viewed by TikTok users around the world — billions and billions of data
points a day — is fed into giant databases, which are then used to train
artificial intelligence to predict which videos will keep users’
attention.

Sometimes, that might mean showing American users videos made in India
or China. (I once fell into a delightful rabbit hole of TikTok dances by
multigenerational Chinese families.) Other times, it could mean using
data from one country’s users to inform another country’s
recommendations. It could even mean using data gleaned from an entirely
different ByteDance app — such as Douyin, the Chinese equivalent of
TikTok — to inform what TikTok users are shown.

ByteDance considers itself, first and foremost, an [A.I.
company](https://fortune.com/longform/tiktok-app-artificial-intelligence-addictive-bytedance-china/).
And the nature of building A.I. is that the more data you have, the
better your algorithms generally are. Would an American TikTok
algorithm, trained only on American users’ data, be less addictive? It’s
certainly possible.

But even if ByteDance was willing to part with TikTok’s algorithms and
the machine learning models they rely on — a big if — it’s not clear
that an American acquirer would be able to recreate TikTok’s magic right
away.

Karl Higley, a recommender systems engineer who previously worked at
Spotify, said that without access to historical data — data about what
TikTok’s users swiped, tapped and lingered on weeks or months earlier —
a new, Americanized TikTok might essentially need to start from scratch.

“In order to personalize the app for existing users, they’re going to
need historical data for U.S. folks unless they want to wipe the slate
clean, which would be a terrible user experience,” Mr. Higley said.

American tech giants, of course, are no slouches when it comes to
building addictive algorithms. And it’s possible that an American-owned
TikTok could rebuild the app’s core technology without users even
noticing a difference. But it’s not trivial work, and it could take
months or years to do — months or years in which Facebook, Snapchat and
other competitors would be nipping at TikTok’s heels. And if users
sensed that their algorithm was degrading in the meantime, or showing
them fewer interesting videos than it once did, they could be tempted to
jump ship.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In addition to recreating TikTok’s algorithms, an American acquirer
would also need to work quickly to preserve TikTok’s other valuable
asset: its creator culture. As [my colleague Taylor Lorenz has
written](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/style/tiktok-ban-threat-trump.html),
TikTok is home to a large, vibrant community of creative talent, some of
whom make a full-time living from the app. Those people are attracted to
TikTok partly because the platform gives them a way to reach a mass
audience. But they’re also attracted to it because TikTok has cultivated
an aura of cool through advertising, striking partnerships with music
festivals and other popular events, and hosting exclusive parties for
TikTok creators at industry events like VidCon.

Already, Facebook is [reportedly trying to poach popular TikTok
creators](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600)for
Instagram Reels, its new TikTok clone, by dangling six-figure deals in
front of them. And if TikTok is acquired by Microsoft — a company not
historically known for its youth appeal — creators could sense that it’s
time to move on.

TikTok could try to lower the risk for an acquirer by striking multiyear
exclusive deals with its most popular American creators, the way that
platforms like YouTube and Twitch have done. It could also accelerate
its plans to let popular users earn money from the platform. But without
a firm grip on its A-list talent, TikTok’s acquirer won’t be assured
that the platform isn’t losing its edge.

Hank Green, a YouTube star and chief executive of the education company
Complexly, who has more than 600,000 followers on TikTok, said that a
TikTok acquisition could make creators more skeptical of the company’s
motives.

“One of the things about TikTok is they’ve been able to make lots of
changes really fast, and people are open and receptive to that,” Mr.
Green said. “If you see that change as coming from outside the
ecosystem, that can feel like a foreign change.”

Many of the people I spoke to agreed that even with the potential
pitfalls and unresolved questions, the opportunity to buy TikTok is a
once-in-a-decade deal for the right acquirer. Popular, growing social
networks are exceedingly rare, and TikTok has already made itself a
fixture of American culture in a way that few other apps ever have.

“TikTok is compelling, not just because of its large and growing user
base, but also because of its platform potential to expand into
e-commerce and livestreaming,” said Connie Chan, a partner at the
venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. “Video is a fantastic way to
sell things and short videos are perfect for product discovery.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Green, the YouTube star, agreed.

“If I had the opportunity to buy TikTok, I’d buy TikTok,” he said.
“There’s so much value on that platform right now that is completely
untapped.”
