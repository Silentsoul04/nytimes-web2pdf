Each of us carries a cord of hope through all our wandering days. Where
it begins, when we found ourselves leaving home --- so many homes; or
when we arrived, when consciousness widened to possibilities of
community --- the cord grows stronger or frays. Juan Felipe Herrera's
magnificent new poems in ``Every Day We Get More Illegal'' testify to
the deepest parts of the American dream --- the streets and parking
lots, the stores and restaurants and futures that belong to all --- from
the times when hope was bright, more like an intimate song than any
anthem stirring the blood. \emph{Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye}

 --- i want to speak of unity that\\
 indescribable thing\\
we have been speaking of since '67 when I first stepped\\
 into LA\\
with a cardboard box luggage piece I was distracted by you\\
your dances askew \& somersaults the kind you see at\\
 shopping centers\\
\& automobile super sale events --- the horns \&\\
 bayonets most of all\\
I wanted to pierce the density the elixirs of everything\\
 something\\
like Max Beckmann did in that restaurant painting of\\
 '37 or '38 exiled\\
from Germany banned \& blazing black jacket --- that\\
 everything\\
in a time of all things in collapse\\
that embrace that particular set of syllables of a sudden\\
 attack\\
or just a breath of a song the one I would hear back in\\
 the early '50s\\
when I walked the barren earth with my mother \&\\
 father the sound\\
of One when Luz still lived \& Felipe still parted the red\\
 lands\\
\& no one knew we existed in the fires the flames that\\
 consume all of us\\
now
