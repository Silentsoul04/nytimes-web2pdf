# Why I’m Obsessed With Patients’ Medical Bills

</div>

To report on the true cost of health care, it’s critical to see what a
hospital charges patients. But since hospitals keep those prices a
secret, I turn to the next best source:
you.

[*Times
Insider*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/times-insider)
*explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes
insights into how our journalism comes together.*

My reporting obsession with medical bills started with a bandage. A
very, very expensive bandage.

Four years ago, before I worked for The New York Times, a reader emailed
me a surprising story. He had taken his 1-year-old daughter to the
emergency room because after her nails were clipped a bit too short, her
finger started spurting blood. The little girl was fine, and received a
disposable bandage that fell off on the car ride home.

Then the bill came: $629 for the visit. How could such a simple visit
cost so much? I discovered that the real cost lay in fees that every
emergency room charges just for walking in the door. I also discovered
something else important.

At the bottom of [my article about the little girl’s
case](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/13/11606760/emergency-facility-fees-american-health-care),
I asked readers to reach out if they had similar bills to share. I
expected a few dozen emails. I ended up with hundreds. Frustrated
readers desperately wanted to share their billing experiences — and, I
quickly learned, had access to some of the most valuable, most private
information in the American health care system.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, I’m turning to the readers of The Times, where I work as an
investigative journalist, to help me report on what people are being
charged when they get tested or treated for the coronavirus. This week,
The Times introduced [a new
form](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/costofcare) so patients may
submit their bills, which contain insights that are nearly impossible to
find elsewhere.

That’s because in the United States, hospitals and doctors’ offices
typically keep their prices secret. Powerful lobbies want to keep things
that way. But people in the Trump administration see transparency as a
way to reduce medical costs. Last year, when they proposed a rule that
would make public the prices that providers negotiate with insurers, the
American Hospital Association [sued to stop
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/health/hospitals-trump-prices-transparency.html).
(The hospitals recently [lost in federal
court](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/23/upshot/hospitals-lost-price-transparency-lawsuit.html)
but plan to appeal the
decision.)

The secrecy that surrounds health care prices is a huge hurdle for
health care reporters like me. I know from academic studies that
America’s health care prices are the [highest in the
world](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89#:~:text=It's%20The%20Prices%2C%20Stupid%3A%20Why,From%20Other%20Countries%20%7C%20Health%20Affairs),
and that fees can [vary
drastically](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/30/upshot/health-care-huge-price-discrepancies.html)
from one hospital or doctor’s office to another.

But it’s still difficult, sometimes impossible, to write a story about
which hospital or doctor is the most expensive or the least. That’s the
information readers want. It’s the information I want, too. And it’s the
hardest to get.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The emails readers sent me after I wrote about that $600 bandage gave me
a solution. Many included medical bills with the price charged, what the
insurer paid and what the patient was responsible for. The secrets were
suddenly in plain sight.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

Since then, readers’ medical bills have become a crucial source for my
reporting. They are the documents that say exactly what medicine costs
in the United States. Coupled with interviews with patients, who can
explain the effects of those costs on their lives, they underpin
powerful stories about living in a country where routine care can cost
three or four times what it does abroad.

Last year, readers’ bills helped me [figure
out](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/7/18137967/er-bills-zuckerberg-san-francisco-general-hospital)
that the only trauma center in San Francisco was out of network with all
private insurance companies, leaving patients with thousands of dollars
in medical debt. I received those bills through a reporting project at
my last job, where we crowdsourced a database of 2,000 emergency room
bills.

Just last month, I got exceptionally lucky when four patients who
received coronavirus tests in one Texas emergency room decided to send
me their billing documents. Three patients sent them in totally
unconnected to one another, each aghast at the prices. (The fourth came
from one patient’s friend.) Together, they showed that the price of a
test [could range from $199 to
$6,408](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/upshot/coronavirus-tests-unpredictable-prices.html)
— all in the same facility.

That story made me eager to better understand what the price of testing
and other coronavirus care looks like in the rest of the country, and,
working with my Times colleagues, I decided that readers’ bills were the
best way to tell the story. (When handling sensitive information, access
is highly restricted and is never published without prior consent.)

Collecting medical bills is, admittedly, a slow, inefficient process
that doesn’t lend itself to automation. The documents that come in are
messy. Some are image files and others are PDFs. Each hospital and
insurer uses its own formatting. A few medical bills — the ones I now
swoon for — include detailed, itemized information that shows the price
of every pill and scan. Others, frustratingly, lump everything together
into one price.

Running a project like this is equal parts stressful and exciting
because I don’t know in advance what stories I’ll tell. Instead, I’m
waiting to see where the readers’ submissions will guide me.

Right now, I’m mostly excited: Since starting on Monday, we’ve already
had nearly 200 submissions. The more I read, the more interesting
patterns I start to notice.
