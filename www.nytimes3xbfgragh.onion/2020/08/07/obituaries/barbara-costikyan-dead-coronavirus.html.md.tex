91}\label{barbara-costikyan-new-york-magazine-food-columnist-dies-at-91}}

Ms. Costikyan, who died of the coronavirus, once wrote that she couldn't
think about food ``without thinking about the people who do it.''

\emph{This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in
the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/obituaries/people-died-coronavirus-obituaries.html}{\emph{here}}\emph{.}

Barbara Costikyan loved traipsing around New York City for fresh foods,
often taking her children along in search of homemade feta from Astoria,
Spanish sausage from East Harlem or fresh herring from the Lower East
Side. When she divorced her first husband and needed an independent
source of income, she turned her love of food into a job.

Beginning in 1980, she wrote the Underground Gourmet column in New York
magazine. The column, created by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/obituaries/milton-glaser-dead.html}{Milton
Glaser (who died in June)} and Jerome Snyder, sought to democratize
quality food by not covering restaurants where entrees exceeded a
particular price; when Ms. Costikyan took over the column, that price
was \$6.95 (about \$22 in today's dollars).

``That isn't dirt-cheap,'' the magazine
\href{https://books.google.com/books?id=_OQCAAAAMBAJ\&pg=PA5\&lpg=PA5\&dq=\%E2\%80\%9Ccostikyan\%22\#v=onepage\&q=\%E2\%80\%9Ccostikyan\%22\&f=false}{wrote}
in introducing Ms. Costikyan, ``but we want to give you places where the
ambience is good, where you can linger with a friend and make an evening
of dinner.''

She was loath to give a bad review and often reached out to restaurant
owners to offer advice. Sometimes, as was case with the Manhattan
Mexican restaurant Caramba!, she would come back and give those places
another try.

Ms. Costikyan described her approach as fueled by empathy. ``I can't
think about food without thinking about the people who do it,'' she
wrote. ``It is, after all, a very human enterprise. People prepare it
with love for other people to eat.''

Barbara Virginia Fatt was born on Dec. 25, 1928, in Manhattan to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1999/01/16/business/arthur-fatt-94-advertising-co-founder.html}{Arthur
and Virginia Finder Fatt}. Her father, a son of Eastern European
immigrants, was a founder of Grey Advertising; her mother was a
homemaker. Her parents hosted parties for guests like Henry Ford and
David Sarnoff, and they taught her that the key to a successful
gathering was good food and great wine.

She gained a reputation for her own dinner parties after marrying Andrew
Heine, a lawyer, serving guests like Steve Allen, when he was the host
of the ``Tonight'' show, and members of the psychedelic rock band
Jefferson Airplane. When she hosted comedians, her friends cautioned her
not to make too many jokes, because she tended to upstage them with her
wit.

During her second marriage, to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/06/23/nyregion/edward-n-costikyan-adviser-to-new-york-politicians-is-dead-at-87.html}{Ed
Costikyan}, an adviser to New York politicians, she hosted fund-raisers
for candidates, including Edward I. Koch before he became mayor of New
York.

Ms. Costikyan died of complications of Covid-19 on June 18 in Edgewater,
N.J. She was 91. In addition to her son, she is survived by her sister,
Marjorie Chester; her daughters, Nancy and Priscilla Heine; four
grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

Ms. Costikyan wanted her knowledge of food and hospitality to go beyond
her home; she wanted to write. She worked her way up from the mailroom
at Curtis Publishing to be an editor at Esquire magazine, writing and
editing lifestyle articles on topics like scuba diving and rodeos.

In 1982 she wrote ``Be Kind to Your Dog at Christmas,'' a children's
book about holiday traditions.

As a food columnist for New York, she spotlighted beloved New York
establishments like Barney Greengrass and Sarabeth's. She also wrote
guides on how to cook and entertain and how to troubleshoot problems,
like a stove breaking on the day of a party. When this happened to her,
she heated a ham through multiple cycles in the dishwasher.

``That ham was really good,'' her son, Jonathan Heine, said in a phone
interview. ``Way more moist.''
