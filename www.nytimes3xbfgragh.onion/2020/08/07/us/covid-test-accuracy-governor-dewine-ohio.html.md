# How Accurate Are Virus Tests? Ohio Governor’s Results Show Positives and Negatives

With testing delays nationwide, experts are increasingly recommending a
new type of rapid test that gives less accurate results. It is
imperfect, but as one expert put it, “pretty good is a lot better than
none.”

Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio received a [negative coronavirus test
result](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/mike-dewine-coronavirus.html)
on Thursday, hours after a positive test result had stopped him from
meeting with President Trump in Cleveland. The contradictory results
during a high-profile moment underscored the challenges of testing, an
issue that has repeatedly stymied the virus response in the United
States.

“I’m sure the internet is lighting up with, ‘Well, you can’t believe any
test,’” Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said [during an interview with 92.3
WCOL](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/433-woody-the-wake-up-call-28200119/episode/governor-mike-dewine-talks-about-his-69800541/?autoplay=true),
a Columbus radio station, on Friday.

“No one should take the results of this test and say, ‘Oh, none of these
numbers are right,’” he added. “There is always a possibility for
error.”

At issue are two types of [coronavirus
tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/15/us/coronavirus-testing-decrease.html)
that are increasingly taking center stage as part of the virus response
in the United States. As part of a screening by the White House, Mr.
DeWine first received an antigen test, a newer type of test that
provides faster results but is less accurate than traditional laboratory
testing. He was later tested using a more standard procedure known as
polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., an accurate but time-intensive
method that requires samples to be processed at a laboratory.

Widespread, fast testing is the cornerstone of any virus response and an
area where the United States has consistently fallen short. In order to
ramp up testing to a level needed to stop the spread of the virus,
experts are increasingly recommending a strategy that casts a wide net
with [widespread adoption of faster, less accurate
tests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html).
But that comes with drawbacks.

To better understand the difference between the two types of tests and
the accuracy of testing overall, we spoke with Dr. Bill Miller, an
epidemiologist at the Ohio State
University.

## What is the difference between a P.C.R. test and an antigen test?

A P.C.R. test is the test that is probably most familiar to Americans.
It involves taking a swab from a person’s nose and sending the sample to
a laboratory to process.

The approach amplifies a sequence of nucleic acids in order to detect
tiny amounts of the virus. Because the process amplifies the sequence,
the test is highly accurate, but the results can take hours or days to
process. “It allows you to get very high sensitivity, meaning most
people who have the virus who have a P.C.R. test are going to get
identified,” Dr. Miller said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But there have been problems with access to the tests. As cases spiked,
the demand overwhelmed laboratories, and shortages in the supply chain
meant many Americans had to wait days — or even weeks — for results.
[The delays render the tests largely
useless](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/us/virus-testing-delays.html).
Experts say results are needed within 24 to 48 hours to effectively
quarantine and contact trace. In the United States, turnaround times are
often stretching three to five days, or more.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

Antigen tests look for a protein that is a part of the virus. They can
also be done using a nasal swab, but can provide [faster,
easy-to-decipher
results](https://www.bd.com/en-us/offerings/capabilities/microbiology-solutions/point-of-care-testing/bd-veritor-sars-cov-2),
similar to a pregnancy test.

Antigen tests can provide results in [less than an
hour.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
But because the process does not amplify particles, Dr. Miller said “the
ability to detect the virus is lower by definition.”

## How accurate are the results?

All virus tests have the possibility of an inaccurate result. “It is
just a fact of clinical testing,” said Dr. Miller, who recommended using
common sense about the risk of exposure when evaluating unexpected
results.

But antigen tests are generally less sensitive and less accurate than
the traditional nasal swab, laboratory test. Interestingly, antigen
tests are more likely to produce false negatives — missing someone who
has the virus — than false positives, the opposite of what appears to
have happened to Mr. DeWine.

Mr. DeWine is expected to be tested again on Saturday.

States are increasingly turning to antigen tests as part of a strategy
to ramp up testing. Mr. DeWine is part of a bipartisan group of
governors — four Republicans and four Democrats — who are negotiating to
purchase the tests from two medical companies, Becton, Dickinson &
Company and the Quidel Corporation. The companies were the [first to
receive emergency
authorization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html)
for antigen tests from the Food and Drug Administration, but the tests
could produce false negative results between 15 and 20 percent of the
time.

## If the results are not always accurate, why are experts pushing for more rapid testing?

The United States is currently testing at a daily rate of 241 tests per
100,000 people, [according to an estimate by Harvard Global Health
Institute](https://globalepidemics.org/july-6-2020-state-testing-targets/).
By the same estimate, the country would need 355 tests per 100,000
people to slow the spread of the virus, and more than 1,000 tests per
100,000 people to truly suppress the virus by detecting and responding
to outbreaks as they occur.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To ramp up enough testing, experts say the United States cannot rely on
traditional one-by-one laboratory tests alone.

Antigen tests offer one strategy that could prove useful for crowded
settings like nursing homes or schools. “You have the advantage of being
able to quickly identify people who might be infected and getting them
isolated and separated,” Dr. Miller said. “Whereas where you have to
wait 48 or 72 hours for a test result to come back, you have that window
of time where people are often not fully isolated or quarantined.”

In short, there are societal benefits to casting a wide net with faster,
less accurate tests, but it can cause confusion on a personal level, as
the DeWine case seems to show.

Speaking from his home in Cedarville, Ohio, on Friday, Mr. DeWine said
it had been “quite a big shock” to be told that he had tested positive.
He recalled that after receiving the news, he and his wife, Fran, came
back home. “Fran fixed me some chicken and rice soup,” he said. “She
thought we were settled in for the long haul here.”

But by Thursday evening, he had received better news.

“The antigen tests do give us a cheap way to do a lot of tests that are
pretty good,” Dr. Miller said. “Pretty good is a lot better than none,
and it collectively gets us a lot closer to the goal of being able to
isolate and quarantine people when they need to be.”
