# Collin Morikawa’s Joyful Win Broke Through Golf’s Pandemic Fog

</div>

Morikawa, 23, delivered a dazzling final round at the P.G.A.
Championship to become the long-overdue first major champion of the 2020
season.

As Collin Morikawa hoisted the huge Wanamaker Trophy above his head on
Sunday evening, giving it a quick, jubilant shake, the lid went
clattering off. Again, he was providing exactly what golf needed in a
season dimmed by plague.

First the 23-year-old Morikawa delivered a dazzling final round to [win
the P.G.A.
Championship](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/09/sports/golf/pga-championship-collin-morikawa.html)at
San Francisco’s T.P.C. Harding Park, becoming the long-overdue first
major champion of 2020. Then came the comic relief, the sheepish smile
as the top of the trophy went astray.

After Morikawa made two unforgettable shots to emerge from a throng of
tenacious contenders on the back nine Sunday, it was tempting to
consider the future of the game, all the more so since that throng
included Matthew Wolff, a 21-year-old in his first major, and Scottie
Scheffler, a 24-year-old, who finished tied for fourth.

But the real value of Morikawa’s beguiling, gutsy victory lay more in
what it showed about the state of golf now than what it portended.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When he drove the ball off the tee to within seven feet of the hole on
No. 16, a dream shot setting up an eagle putt, Morikawa made it easy to
forget that this major tournament was being held three months late and
shadowed by the coronavirus pandemic.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to [early ratings
returns](https://golfweek.usatoday.com/2020/08/08/golf-on-tv-ratings-espn-cbs-pga-tour/),
the tournament drew its biggest TV audience in five years, even as golf
was competing with the resumption of U.S. league sports. And, as has
happened throughout the PGA Tour’s return since mid-June, fans turned
out in person despite being prohibited from attending, notably
collapsing parts of the fencing that blocked views of the 12th and 13th
holes from the viewing public.  
  
Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry was an exception to the
fan-less rule that has governed golf’s return. With his team eliminated
from the N.B.A. postseason, Curry followed Morikawa’s group on Sunday,
then crashed the post-round news conference to offer his caddying
services to the champion.

Morikawa, a Lakers fan, declined.

The interest in Sunday’s final owed as much to Morikawa’s jaw-dropping
shots as it did to a preposterously talented field which, at one point
on Sunday, featured a seven-person tie for the lead.

Paul Casey, the 43-year-old Englishman, ended the day in a tie for
second with Dustin Johnson. They finished two strokes behind Morikawa’s
13-under-par for the tournament after he shot a final round six-under
64.

A win for either would have carried significance. Casey has started more
major championships (64) without gaining a title than any other active
player. And this was the fourth time that Johnson has held or shared a
54-hole lead at a major and been unable to close the deal, an
ignominious
record.

### Sports and the Virus

#### 

Updated Sept. 8, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - As the United States Open enters its second week without fans,
        an Italian restaurateur stands outside the gates and [bellows

        his favorite player.
      - The coronavirus pandemic has had an [uneven impact on high

        the United States.
      - The [most complicated puzzle in sports is the return of college
        athletics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-cal-athletics-season.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) during
        a pandemic. The University of California, Berkeley is allowing
        The Times an inside look at their journey’s ups and downs.

For all his talent, Johnson, 36, has won just one major, the 2016 United
States Open — a point [impudently noted on Saturday night by Brooks
Koepka](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/sports/brooks-koepka-pga-championship.html),
winner of the previous two P.G.A. Championships.

“I like my chances,” said Koepka, who was two strokes behind Johnson
after the third round. “When I’ve been in this position before, I’ve
capitalized.”

He noted that Johnson had “only won one, so — I’m playing good, so we’ll
see.”

Koepka quickly fell out of contention on Sunday, shooting a four-over
74, while Rory McIlroy publicly challenged his comments about Johnson.

“Sort of hard to knock a guy that’s got 21 wins on the PGA Tour, which
is three times what Brooks has,” said McIlroy, who, like Koepka, is a
four-time major winner.

Ultimately, though, that squabble and Johnson's unfortunate retreat from
the top of the leaderboard paled next to Morikawa’s thrilling, and
remarkably mature, play.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“All my caddie friends say the same thing,” said his caddie, J.J.
Jakovac. “They’re like, I just cannot get over how mature your guy is.
He’s like an old soul or something.”

Morikawa’s familiarity with the course certainly helped him. By his own
calculations, he played at Harding Park at least a dozen times during
his college career at the nearby University of California, Berkeley.

“To be honest, through college, it wasn’t my favorite,” he said. “I
don’t think I played it extremely well.”

Just a little over a year after turning pro, Morikawa has now won three
times on the PGA Tour, twice in the relative silence of this summer’s
spectator-free tournaments. Morikawa said he wouldn’t have minded
hearing a big reaction when his 293-yard drive at 16 reached the green,
since he and his caddie couldn’t see where the ball ended up.

“This is the one time I really wish there were crowds right there,” he
said.

Still, his 65 and 64 over the weekend gave him the lowest closing
36-hole score ever at a men’s major. The previous record of 130 was held
by Tom Watson (1977 British Open), Ian Baker-Finch (1991 British Open),
Anders Forsbrand (1994 British Open), Marc Leishman (2015 British Open)
and Tiger Woods (2018 P.G.A. Championship).

So Morikawa wasn’t inclined to think about what was missing, except,
very briefly, the lid to his new trophy.
