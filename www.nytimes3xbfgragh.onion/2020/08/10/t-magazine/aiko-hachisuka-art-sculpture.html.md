# The Artist Making Bulbous, Colorful Sculptures Out of Thrifted Clothes

</div>

Each of Aiko Hachisuka’s intricate, hand-stitched pieces is a meditation
on memory, materiality and domestic labor.

When, as a young girl in Nagoya, Japan, Aiko Hachisuka observed her
mother and grandmother sewing, she didn’t quite know what they were
doing — maybe mending a sock or attaching buttons, she thinks now — but
she was keenly aware that they were not to be disturbed. “I was very
attracted to that focus, and the creative headspace that they were in,”
she says. It was the closest thing to a studio practice that she had
been exposed to. “I knew I needed to have work myself,” she says. “My
first attempt at that was to go and buy a sketchbook.”

As an artist, Hachisuka, 46 — who now lives in Los Angeles, where she
shares a home and studio with her partner, the painter John Williams —
has maintained a practice rooted in the humility of domestic work. The
large and vibrant stuffed fabric sculptures for which she is best known
— and which have been shown most recently at [Van Doren
Waxter](https://www.vandorenwaxter.com/) in New York — are constructed
slowly and methodically over a period of three to four months. Yet even
hung on a gallery wall, they retain the energy of the woven mats her
grandmother used to construct from the family’s old clothing. “I liked
the fact that it was something you put on the floor, that you stepped
on,” she says.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But though Hachisuka identified her interest in art-making, especially
as related to textiles and stitching, early on, her path to her current
practice was not a direct one. As a teenager, she applied to be a
foreign exchange student in the United States and was placed with two
different families in Pensacola, Fla., for her junior and senior years
of high school. After a portfolio review her senior year, she was
accepted to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and the Ringling College of
Art and Design, in Sarasota, Fla. At the insistence of her host mother,
who thought New York might be dangerous or overwhelming, she chose
Ringling. “Some people still think I went to circus school,” Hachisuka
says with a laugh.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In her third year, during a semester-long independent study in New York,
she began to experiment more, both creatively and conceptually. This was
the mid-1990s, a decade after the end of the Pattern and Decoration
movement, and artists such as [Mike
Kelley](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/02/02/arts/design/mike-kelley-influential-american-artist-dies-at-57.html)
and [Annette
Messager](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/06/25/arts/25iht-messager.1.6316141.html)
were appropriating the vocabulary of textile work to great critical
acclaim. It was common for Hachisuka’s fellow students to have sewing
machines in their studios, and, she says, “kids were making drawings out
of doilies, or taking cubes from cake decoration sets and incorporating
them into paintings.” She started using puff paint and found objects —
cheap ornaments and stuffed animals purchased on Canal Street — to
create sculptures. Instead of pedestals, she would place the pieces on
top of hand-sewn
pillows.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After graduate school at CalArts, where she studied under the conceptual
artist [Charles
Gaines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/07/arts/charles-gaines-edward-macdowell-medal.html)
and took a brief detour into video (“CalArts was very post-studio right
then,” she says), Hachisuka was ready to return to three-dimensional
work. Her first piece was a nearly life-size fabric recreation of the
crumpled head of a GMC semi truck with a felt shopping cart and felt
pipes and bricks, all things she’d seen at a junkyard in East Los
Angeles.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, she kept thinking back to her grandmother’s rag rugs — their
unpretentiousness and how, studded with bits of Hachisuka’s childhood
clothing, they functioned a bit like a family photograph. “I knew what I
wanted to make,” she says, “but I didn’t know how to find the door into
it.” One afternoon in 2003, she was sitting on the sofa in her
apartment, her cat draped over her arm and across the seat cushion —
stretched like a stitch, connecting Hachisuka to the furniture. “My body
touching the furniture became a unified thing,” she says. “I thought,
‘What if I make furniture that *is* a body?’”

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-1l9o2ey e13ogyst0">Though the artist has recently
moved toward sculptures that are wall-mounted, she has also made
free-standing pieces built around cylindrical armatures. Here, her work
“Untitled”
(2017).</span><span class="css-cch8ym"><span class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</span></span>](https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/10/t-magazine/10tmag-hachisuka-02/10tmag-hachisuka-02-mediumSquareAt3X.jpg)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She’d found her way in and hasn’t closed the door since. Each of
Hachisuka’s pieces starts with an armature — initially they were found
couch frames, then foam cylinders, and most recently wall-mounted
supports — and a collection of both new and secondhand clothing, some of
it acquired from tag sales or her partner’s closet. She stuffs the
garments with a natural fiber called Kapok to create volume and density
(“[Christian
Scheidemann](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/11/the-art-doctor),
the art conservator, told me that [Claes
Oldenburg](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/16/t-magazine/claes-oldenburg.html)
uses it in his soft sculpture, and I’ve been using it ever since”).
Finally, she arranges and stitches the individual pieces together into
forms that ripple and bulge, at once solid as a compacted car and yet
pushing outward as though full of air. In Hachisuka’s earlier couch
pieces, a pair of legs might emerge from a seat cushion or the arm of a
sweatshirt might wrap around a pillow in a gentle embrace. Her newer
work is increasingly abstract. Up close, one can recognize the ribbed
collar of a child’s sweater, perhaps, or the elastic waistband of a pair
of athletic shorts — the body evident only in its absence.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even as the artist’s work moves away from recognizable forms, though, it
retains an intimate connection to family and home. Initially, Hachisuka
made work from clothing she bought at Forever 21, but she felt that
reduced it to a comment on fast fashion. Then she started thrifting
clothes, but the pieces became disjointed. After stopping at a tag sale
one day on a whim, she found she could put together a loose family
structure — two kids, a mother who worked for a dentist’s office, a
father who went to church — based on a rack of discards, and liked that
the clothes told a story both specific and not. “It had this family
history that I could never replicate,” Hachisuka says.

About 10 years ago, Hachisuka started adding paint to the clothing
pieces before she stuffed them. She uses a modified screen-printing
process, laying a mesh screen over the garment and applying ink without
a preset design. She’s seeking a very pared-down way of working, and she
lets the folds and wrinkles of the dropped clothing determine the
patterns. “Each piece of clothing is like a mini-painting,” she says.
“And then I stitch them together like a puzzle.” Once she has removed
the screen from the clothing, she creates a monoprint by applying paper
to the back of the screen, capturing a kind of photo negative of the
garment. A collection of these prints is [currently on
view](https://www.vandorenwaxter.com/exhibitions/aiko-hachisuka3) on Van
Doren Waxter’s website.

Like mending, Hachisuka’s art is nearly without ego, and intentionally
so — she designed the process so as to remove her own hand and eye from
the finished work as much as possible. “I don’t want my taste or liking
to get in the way of making,” she says. “I’m there every step of the
way, but when I’m done, looking at it, it doesn’t feel like mine.” It’s
more the concept that is personal, with Hachisuka thinking back to
watching her mother and grandmother at work all the while. “I’ve always
wanted to return to that space,” she says, “even
today.”
