# The Artist and Filmmaker Envisioning a Safer World for Black Women

Interspersing found footage with original interviews, Ja’Tovia Gary
makes poetic video works that elucidate the realities of racial
injustice — and how the country might change.

Ti’jhae Beecher is 7 years old when she happens upon the artist and
filmmaker Ja’Tovia Gary on the corner of West **** 116th Street and
Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem in 2019. Gary, flanked by a camera crew
and with a microphone in hand, had stopped her to ask a simple question:
“Do you feel safe?” Beecher, who is standing with her grandfather,
answers yes and proceeds to tell Gary about how she feels prepared to
leave the house every day, but that there are times when she is upset
about having to wake up early for school. Gary agrees that waking up
early is, in fact, the worst, and then asks Beecher if, for the most
part, she feels good. Beecher replies plainly: “I don’t feel like I’m in
danger.”

“That’s good,” Gary says in response. “I hope you never ever feel like
you are in danger, that you always feel safe and strong.” Gary’s
interview with Beecher is one of many that she conducts with Black women
and girls in Harlem that day, asking those passers-by — who differ in
age, ethnicity and spiritual identification — if they feel safe in their
bodies, and in the world. She includes their wide-ranging responses to
her question in “[The Giverny
Document](https://www.jatovia.com/the-giverny-document-2019#1)” (2019),
an experimental film that explores what it means to exist in the world
for Black women, and Black women only. The roughly 40-minute feature was
part of a three-channel video installation presented at both Paula
Cooper Gallery in New York and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles this
year (both shows closed early because of Covid-19), but has also been
shown as a stand-alone project at film festivals, garnering Gary awards
and critical
acclaim.

When Gary, 35, talked about that moment with Beecher over the phone the
Monday after this past Juneteenth, she described her own response as
naïve, because, she said, “there is no way that she is going to feel
safe forever.” But, Gary added, “our job is to create a world where that
is possible.” As she sees it, part of her mission as a Black Southern
queer artist is to help shape this imagined world, one in which Black
women do not live in a state of precarity, forever teetering between
violence and safety. **Indeed,** Gary has been engaging with themes of
power and representations of Black womanhood in her work since 2010. Her
films are painterly and essayistic, combining seemingly disparate
archival footage to elicit new and different emotional responses from
the viewer. “Healing is at the root of the work,” she said. “Making art
is a transformative process that transmutes pain or trauma into
something beautiful, useful, functional, instructive for those who can
engage with the work, and for me.”

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Before Gary made films, she wanted to be in them. She was born in Dallas
and raised in Cedar Hill, a lush suburb about 20 minutes outside of the
city, which she characterizes as alienating. She came from a family of
religious storytellers — there are preachers and ministers on both of
her parents’ sides — and always loved an audience: “I was the girl who
was going to read out loud in language arts class,” she said. In fifth
grade, her stepfather died, and the experience left her with anxiety
that complicated her relationship to attention. Still, Gary went on to
become “a theater geek,” and, when she was in the 11th grade, she
transferred to Dallas’s Booker T. Washington High School for the
Performing and Visual Arts, a highly competitive arts school whose
alumni include Erykah Badu and Norah Jones. To say the experience
changed her life is an understatement. There, Gary studied ancient Greek
theater, Shakespeare and Molière alongside foundational Black texts: “I
learned about Black women playwrights, the Black feminist literary
tradition as well, everyone from Ntozake Shange to Lorraine Hansberry.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Armed with this knowledge and ambition, she left Texas and moved to New
York in 2002 to study at Marymount Manhattan College. After a year, she
dropped out (for a combination of financial and mental health reasons),
started waiting tables and got herself a manager. She landed some roles
in television commercials and doing voiceovers, and was relatively
successful, but the opportunities were limiting and “demoralizing,” she
said, recalling one gig for which she was instructed to be “a little
more urban.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While assessing her feelings about acting and the roles available to
her, Gary re-enrolled in school — this time at Brooklyn College — and
started taking classes in Africana studies. “Figuring out how I was
going to move forward as an artist became a serious conundrum,” she
said. “For me, moving to the position of director was about gaining
agency and power and autonomy.”

From behind the camera, Gary has been able to create work that explores
and reclaims Black women’s subjectivity. In her 2015 short “[An Ecstatic
Experience](https://www.jatovia.com/gallery-3#1),” she combines, among
other clips, one from a 1965 television show in which the actress Ruby
Dee dramatizes the narrative of Fannie Moore, a woman born into slavery
in 1849, with one of the activist Assata Shakur talking to the reporter
Gil Noble in 1987 about her escape from the United States to Cuba. Gary
employs a technique called direct animation, etching cubes around Dee’s
face, as well as stripes, waves and halos — marks that emphasize a
feeling of frenzy and ecstasy, temporarily destabilizing the viewer and
connecting one Black woman’s liberation to another. She uses a similar
approach in “[Giverny I (Négresse
Impériale)](https://www.jatovia.com/giverny-i-negresse-imperiale#1),” a
six-minute short she made in 2016 during a summer residency with the
Terra Foundation for American Art in Giverny, France. “Giverny I,” all
of which is included in “The Giverny Document,” addresses the insecurity
of the Black woman’s body by juxtaposing video of Gary in Claude Monet’s
garden with Diamond Reynold’s video of the cop who fatally shot her
boyfriend, Philando Castile, that same summer. The result is a chaotic
yet clarifying compendium of images. “I don’t want the work to lull
people into a sense of complacency,” Gary said. “I don’t want them to be
merely satisfied or entertained.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The power of her films comes in part from her intimate and involved
process. Gary spends hours scouring the internet for archival footage —
from live performances to interviews — and treats the material as a
canvas, scratching or painting onto the film surface or even adhering
flower petals to clear film strips before digitizing and editing them.
In the case of the Facebook Live footage she uses in “The Giverny
Document,” Gary obscures Castile’s bloodied body with leaves and petals
she plucked from the plants in Monet’s garden to interrogate the ease
with which society consumes images of Black death and violence.

Over the last five years, Gary has been working on an autobiographical
documentary titled “[The Evidence of Things Not
Seen](https://www.jatovia.com/things-not-seen#1).” It’s a project about
her relationship to her family that recently brought her back to Dallas
(after 16 years in New York and a brief stint in Boston), where she has
been self-isolating during the pandemic. In some ways it has allowed her
to embark on her own healing journey, she explained. “It requires
honesty with not simply my family but myself,” she said of the work.
“It’s very much about leaping with no net, you know, and asking, do
you have the courage to do
that?”
