This past January, during men’s fashion week in London, the designer
Paria Farzaneh invited guests to an East London **** boys’ school for an
Iranian wedding. A bride sat onstage in a **** traditional **** white
lace gown before **** a banquet of Persian pastries and urns overflowing
with pastel-colored roses and baby’s breath. The groom, seated next to
her, wore a paisley-printed ski jacket, its high, mouth-covering neck
pre-empting the protective masks of the pandemic. An older community
leader in a black suit presided over the faux ceremony in Farsi, as the
viewers sat divided by gender — men on one side of the aisle, women on
the other, though the men outnumbered the women and ended up infringing
on their section. This was a deliberate move on Farzaneh’s part intended
to highlight the power imbalance she feels in her industry — where a
woman truly at the helm of her own brand is still something of a rarity
— and was typical of the subtle gestures toward the tensions of our
present moment that are embedded in her line. At the end of the
ceremony, the groom rose and strode down the aisle, followed by a
procession of young men dressed in looks from the [fall 2020
collection](https://www.pariafarzaneh.com/aw20) of Farzaneh’s namesake
line, which combined the swagger and oversize silhouettes of streetwear
with the understated, earthy palette of hand-printed Iranian textiles.

“For me, fashion is merely a platform for something much bigger,” says
Farzaneh. Which is not to say she doesn’t delight in the design process,
or that design **** isn’t a tool in and of itself. She may be one of the
few Londoners who, a few months into the pandemic, decamped to Milan,
where she spent several weeks working on her next collection and
communicating more directly with the Italian mills where she researches
and develops her fabrics. She’s particularly interested in fabric and
handwork, and sources her signature patterned cotton **** textiles from
Isfahan, Iran’s historic center of textile and rug production. They
feature finely wrought florals, paisleys and other motifs created by
hand according to the ancient tradition of Ghalamkar printing, in which
intricately hand-carved wood blocks are used to stamp patterns onto a
length of cloth one color at a time, with only the artisan’s eye as a
guide. “All the dyes are plant-based, using saffron, turmeric and
pomegranate, and the pieces are washed in the river and dried in the
sun,” explains Farzaneh, who has an ability to transform these fabrics —
which Iranians might recognize as the sort more typically used for
blankets and bedspreads — into deeply modern and covetable garments. She
has a similar knack for refreshing other elements that in different
contexts might feel old-fashioned, such as flared pants or especially
wide lapels. She’s put drawstrings at the ankles of Ghalamkar-printed
trousers; made polo shirts from strips of acid-green, waterproof,
nylon-blended cloth, overlapped to resemble the lattice of a pie crust;
and created patchwork suiting from leftover scraps. Along the way, she’s
caught the attention of the N.B.A. stars LeBron James and Nick “Swaggy
P” Young; the apparel companies **** Gore-Tex and Converse, both of
which she’s collaborated with; and the selection committee behind the
[LVMH Prize](https://www.lvmhprize.com/designer/paria-farzaneh/), for
which she was shortlisted last
year.

But contextualizing her clothes is almost as important to Farzaneh as
the fabrics and silhouettes themselves. Since launching her label in
2017, she has staged an immersive fashion show each season: [For
spring 2019](https://www.pariafarzaneh.com/ss19), models posed along a
truck bed installed with seven detailed sets inspired by Nowruz, the
Persian New Year, in a collection dedicated to her late uncle, whose
presence could be felt in uniform-like khaki pieces. [The following
season](https://www.pariafarzaneh.com/aw19), Farzaneh mailed out her
invitations with plastic bags for each audience member to stash their
phone in during the show; on the day of, few complied, and onstage, the
models, some in tech-y fabrics, others in jackets that wrapped around
the body in a suggestion of passive captivity, moved along a conveyor
belt with their eyes glued to their own devices. [For
spring 2020](https://www.pariafarzaneh.com/ss20), her models wore
matching transparent Halloween masks with garish makeup, T-shirts
puff-painted with Farsi script and, in one instance, an overcoat that
looked as though it had been stamped by the British Border Force, which
read like an eerie comment on the United Kingdom’s surveillance and
immigration control policies. “I try to transport people to a place
they’ve never been before,” Farzaneh says. “It’s important for me to
put an audience in that position — it’s not just about pushing a product
or a trend.”

</div>

</div>

![<span class="css-1l9o2ey e13ogyst0">The complex constructions of
Farzaneh’s designs are testament to her ability as a pattern-cutter,
which runs in her family. “My grandad was a tailor in Iran and he was
the suavest gentlemen,” she
recalls.</span><span class="css-cch8ym"><span class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</span><span class="css-1nlbvxy e1z0qqy90" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>By

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Farzaneh credits her desire to bring people into her world to her
experience growing up in what she describes as the “five percent
minority” in a rural village in Yorkshire. Her parents, who emigrated
from Iran before she was born, “were never in a position to make me feel
like I was different,” Farzaneh says, “but as I got older, I started to
see more of a disconnect. People didn’t understand.” Her family’s
influence can be felt deeply in her work — faded photos of her relatives
fill the label’s social feeds, and her father occasionally models for
the brand’s look books. Also, Farzaneh’s grandfather was a tailor in
Iran, and her mother made much of Farzaneh’s childhood
clothing.

On the other hand, she appreciates the creative distance afforded by
being a woman exploring masculinity, even if she usually wears men’s
clothes herself. “In women’s wear, the details of practicality are
compromised by garments being cropped, tight or short,” she says. In
2016, she earned her degree in fashion design from London’s Ravensbourne
University. Since then, Farzaneh, now 26, has established herself among
a wave of London-based female designers of men’s wear — including Grace
Wales Bonner, Martine Rose, [Priya
Ahluwalia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/10/t-magazine/priya-ahluwalia-fashion-menswear.html),
Bianca Saunders and Mowalola Ogunlesi — who have reimagined the city’s
men’s wear scene over the past half-decade. Each offers her own take,
but they are alike in that, just by existing in the field, they push
back against the elitist traditions of Savile Row tailoring firms — some
of which still only dress male customers — and the traditionally fusty
world of British craftsmanship. Some of these women, like Farzaneh, also
offer artistic visions informed by the immigrant experience of their
families.

“Eventually,” Farzaneh says, “people are going to listen, because
they’re tired of seeing and smelling and tasting the same monotonous
world.” By making clothes with care and imbuing them with meaning, she
offers an antidote to the myriad soulless, throwaway options available
on the market today, and advances the conversation about what, and who,
is part of fashion. “Success for me is about being honest with myself
and not compromising what I believe in,” she says. “It’s about
authenticity and
realness.”
