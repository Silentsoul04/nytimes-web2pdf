# Marjorie Taylor Greene, a QAnon Supporter, Wins House Primary in Georgia

</div>

Ms. Greene’s victory came as six states were holding elections on
Tuesday, with Ilhan Omar holding off a well-funded primary challenge in
Minnesota.

Conspiracy theorists won a major victory on Tuesday as a Republican
supporter of [the convoluted pro-Trump movement
QAnon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/01/us/politics/what-is-qanon.html)
triumphed in her House primary runoff election in Georgia, all but
ensuring that she will represent a deep-red district in Congress.

The ascension of Marjorie Taylor Greene, who [embraces a conspiracy
theory](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/qanon-politicians-candidates.html)
that the F.B.I. has labeled a potential domestic terrorism threat, came
as six states held primary and runoff elections on Tuesday.

Those races included a well-funded Democratic primary challenge to
Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, [who emerged
victorious](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/ilhan-omar-minnesota-primary-election.html)
to secure a clean sweep of re-election fights for the group of
first-term Democratic congresswomen of color known as the Squad.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The voting unfolded as elections officials across the country continue
to grapple with the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, using
primaries as lower-turnout dry runs for the November general election.
The electoral contests on Tuesday in
[Wisconsin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/us/politics/wisconsin-election-absentee-coronavirus.html)
and
[Georgia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/politics/georgia-election-voting-problems.html)
bore particular scrutiny after voting meltdowns in each state earlier
this year. The balloting in both places appeared to be unfolding more
smoothly this time, though there were worries about the number of
absentee ballots still in the mail in Wisconsin.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Georgia, Ms. Greene defeated John Cowan, a neurosurgeon who is no
less conservative or pro-Trump, according to The Associated Press,
[holding a lead of roughly 15 percentage
points](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/11/us/elections/results-georgia-house-district-14-republican-primary-runoff-election.html)
early Wednesday. The result is likely to unsettle mainstream
Republicans, who have sought to publicly distance themselves from QAnon
supporters running for congressional office this cycle even as they
quietly support some of them.

Now, with Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, one of the most
Republican in the country, likely to vote red in November, Ms. Greene is
all but assured of getting the chance to put into action her talk of
rooting out an imagined deep-state cabal of pedophile Satanists who are
trying to take down [President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html).

QAnon, a conspiracy theory that has attracted a fervent following since
it emerged from the troll-infested fringes of the internet nearly three
years ago, has already inspired real-world violence, including [the
killing of a mob
boss](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/21/nyregion/gambino-shooting-anthony-comello-frank-cali.html).
Its supporters are [slowly becoming a political
force](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/qanon-politicians-candidates.html)
that some Republicans feel they cannot afford to alienate, even as the
party struggles to distance itself from racist and anti-Semitic
conspiracy theories.

More than a dozen candidates who have expressed some degree of support
for QAnon are running for Congress as Republicans, their path cleared by
Mr. Trump’s own espousal of conspiracy theories.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most are going to lose. But a few, Ms. Greene foremost among them, have
managed to win. Declaring victory on Tuesday night, she said she was
“just as fed up with what I’ve seen from spineless Republicans” as she
was with Democrats.

“The Republican establishment was against
me,”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Ms. Greene said. “The
D.C. swamp is against me. And the lying fake news media hates my guts.
It’s a badge of honor. It’s not about me winning. This is a referendum
on every single one of us, on our beliefs.”

On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1293525010523578375?s=20):
“Congratulations to future Republican Star Marjorie Taylor Greene on a
big Congressional primary win in Georgia against a very tough and smart
opponent. Marjorie is strong on everything and never gives up — a real
WINNER\!”

During his campaign, Mr. Cowan had adopted a slogan that summed up the
predicament that Ms. Greene posed for Republicans: “All of the
conservative, none of the embarrassment.”

“She is not conservative — she’s crazy,” Mr. Cowan [told Politico before
the
runoff](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/09/republicans-marjorie-taylor-greene-392735).
“She deserves a YouTube channel, not a seat in Congress. She’s a circus
act.”

Mr. Cowan was not alone in his assessment of Ms. Greene, who runs a
construction company with her husband. She earned a rebuke from
Republican congressional leaders this year after Facebook videos showed
her making [offensive remarks about Black people, Jews and
Muslims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/us/marjorie-taylor-greene-georgia.html).
Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House minority whip,
publicly campaigned for Mr. Cowan and helped him raise money.

The Republican Party, though, was hardly uniform in its opposition to
Ms. Greene’s candidacy. The leadership officially remained neutral, and
Mr. Trump’s only comment on the race [came in the form of a
congratulatory
tweet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/qanon-politicians-candidates.html)
after her strong showing in the first-round primary in June, when she
nearly doubled Mr. Cowan’s vote total.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Greene raised thousands of dollars from Representative Jim Jordan of
Ohio, a high-profile Republican lawmaker and a favorite of the
president, and a political action committee with which he is associated,
the House Freedom Fund. She also secured modest four-figure donations
from political action committees associated with Mark Meadows, a former
North Carolina representative who is now Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, and
Koch Industries, a financial mainstay of the Republican Party. The Koch
PAC said that it had requested a refund of its donation in June, though
it was not clear whether the money was returned.

In Minnesota, Democrats had rallied to Ms. Omar’s aid in recent weeks,
making bedfellows of progressives such as Representative Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez and establishment leaders like Speaker Nancy
Pelosi.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Leading up to the primary, Ms. Omar’s unabashed embrace of left-wing
politics had won her loyal followers in Minnesota and across the
country. She had, however, also become a lightning rod for conservatives
and has faced criticism from some Democrats, particularly after several
episodes in 2019 in which she was accused of making anti-Semitic
remarks.

But in the end voters rewarded her representation of the district and
her calls for far-reaching progressive change.

“In Minnesota, we know that organized people will always beat organized
money,” Ms. Omar [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1293372617957740544?s=20) on
Tuesday night. “Tonight, our movement didn’t just win. We earned a
mandate for change. Despite outside efforts to defeat us, we once again
broke turnout records. Despite the attacks, our support has only grown.”

At a Tuesday evening campaign event in Dinkytown, a Minneapolis
neighborhood where Ms. Omar likes to spend election nights talking to
voters, young supporters gathered as people in cars drove past yelling
“Ilhan\!” and “We love you\!”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Britt D’Arezzo, 22, said national perceptions of Ms. Omar didn’t account
for her retail politics and her visibility at home.

“They don’t know her local activism,” Ms. D’Arezzo said. “They don’t see
her walking around and just hanging out on corners. They don’t see the
way she connects with us.”

In Wisconsin, where worries have persisted over the ability to hold
successful virus-era elections since a voting fiasco in April, there
were no hourslong, mask-dotted lines wrapping around Milwaukee city
blocks.

The city opened more than 150 polling locations, compared with just six
in April, and other municipalities were able to open nearly all of their
normal poll sites. National Guard troops dressed in plainclothes filled
in for poll workers who didn’t show up to work.

But one looming concern was the large number of absentee ballots in the
mail. While the April primary eventually settled on a “postmarked by”
deadline for absentee ballots, meaning any ballot put in the mail by
Election Day would count, no such relief was provided for Tuesday’s
election; ballots had to be in clerk’s offices by the time polls closed.

In Georgia, the scale of the elections was much smaller than during the
chaotic June primary, with roughly 90 of the state’s 159 counties
holding elections on Tuesday.

There were no grueling lines as in June, but election security activists
worried that the low turnout had masked some glitches, largely with the
state’s electronic poll books and check-in system.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The severity of those problems that we saw, while they were not huge in
quantity because of the low level of people voting,” said Marilyn Marks,
the executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, an
elections watchdog group in Georgia, “they clearly are going to create
serious problems in November.”
