[Brooks
Brothers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/business/brooks-brothers-factory-closings.html),
the venerable retailer that was founded in 1818 and [filed for
bankruptcy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/business/brooks-brothers-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html)
last month, said it would be sold to Simon Property Group, the biggest
mall operator in the United States, and Authentic Brands Group, a
licensing firm.

The $325 million offer for Brooks Brothers, up from a [$305 million
bid](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200723005977/en/Brooks-Brothers-Enters-305-Million-Stalking-Horse)
last month from the same suitors, is subject to court approval this
week, the companies said in a
[statement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200811005866/en/Brooks-Brothers-Seek-Approval-Sale-Authentic-Brands)
late on Tuesday. The buyers committed to continue operating at least 125
Brooks Brothers retail locations. Before the pandemic, the company
operated 424 retail and outlet stores globally, including 236 in the
United States, according to court documents.

The offer for Brooks Brothers came from an entity known as the SPARC
Group, a joint venture between Simon Property and Authentic Brands
Group. The mall owner and A.B.G. have teamed up on deals to buy other
bankrupt retailers in recent years, including the teen chain Aéropostale
and the fast-fashion behemoth
[Forever 21](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/23/business/forever-21-bankruptcy-chang-family.html?searchResultPosition=8).
SPARC has also bid on [Lucky
Brand](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clothing-retailer-lucky-brand-files-for-bankruptcy-11593821941),
the denim company that filed for bankruptcy last month. A.B.G. is known
for acquiring the intellectual property of brands like[Barneys New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/24/business/barneys-banktrupcy-bidder.html)
and Sports Illustrated, then licensing their names to other companies
and earning royalties from related products.

The coronavirus outbreak has toppled several storied retail brands,
especially those focused on apparel, as many stores were forced to
temporarily close and demand for new clothing dropped in a remote, less
social environment. Chains including J.C. Penney, J. Crew, Neiman Marcus
and the owner of Ann Taylor and Loft have filed for [bankruptcy
protection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/ascena-bankruptcy-ann-taylor-lane-bryant.html)
since May, struggling with lost sales and heavy debt loads. Most say
they plan to re-emerge with fewer stores.

Brooks Brothers, based in New York, is the oldest apparel brand in
continuous operation in the United States, and has a rare and storied
reputation. It has dressed all but four presidents dating to James
Madison, has been worn by Clark Gable and Andy Warhol and is the
official clothier of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. [Abraham
Lincoln](https://magazine.brooksbrothers.com/dressing-lincoln/) was
wearing a Brooks Brothers coat the night he was
assassinated.

It was revived in the past two decades by the Italian industrialist
Claudio Del Vecchio, who bought it in 2001. The retailer started to slip
in recent years, battered by the rise of more casual workplace attire
and the shift to online retail, prompting a search for new buyers or
investors. Brooks Brothers said in court documents that since April
2019, its business had been marketed to more than 90 potential investors
around the world. The retailer said that its revenue exceeded $991
million for the fiscal year that ended 2019, with about one-fifth of
that coming from its North America e-commerce business.

The pandemic dealt a new and unexpected blow to Brooks Brothers, given
its pricey, formal merchandise and reliance on physical retail. Not only
were its stores temporarily closed, but so were the offices of many of
its customers. Proms, weddings, graduations, bar mitzvahs and other
special occasions fell off calendars. On Zoom, sweatpants cannot be
distinguished from tailored dress pants.

The level of distress at Brooks Brothers came into sharper focus this
year when the company prepared to close its three U.S. factories, in
Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina, forgoing its “Made in
America” calling card, and announcing plans to lay off nearly 700
employees. Like many retailers, it furloughed most of its staff — it had
roughly 4,000 employees before the pandemic — and cut the salaries of
corporate workers. Before filing for bankruptcy, it had already decided
to close 51 Brooks Brothers stores in the United States.

If it is approved, the acquisition by the SPARC Group will have
proceeded remarkably quickly, given that Brooks Brothers filed for
bankruptcy protection on July 8.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On an earnings call this week, David Simon, the chief executive of Simon
Property, outlined several benefits to the acquisitions of bankrupt
retailers through SPARC, which he referred to as a 50-50 joint venture
with A.B.G. He said that it was acquiring inventory at or below cost,
buying any intellectual property at “attractive values,” cutting the
overhead costs of purchased companies and able to reject certain leases.

He disputed the notion that Simon Property was “buying into these
retailers to pay us rent,” saying that the company believed in the
brands and thought they could make money. He also noted that the venture
was saving jobs at places like Brooks Brothers.

“That’s what we should talk about,” he said on the call. “We’re doing
our fair share for trying to keep this world as normal as we can.”
