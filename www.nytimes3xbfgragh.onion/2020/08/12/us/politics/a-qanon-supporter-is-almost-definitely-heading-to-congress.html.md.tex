Conspiracy theorists won a major victory on Tuesday as Marjorie Taylor
Greene, a Republican supporter of the convoluted pro-Trump movement
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/13/technology/qanon-tea-party.html}{QAnon},
triumphed in her House primary runoff election in Georgia, all but
ensuring that she will represent a deep-red district in Congress.

The ascension of Ms. Greene, who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/qanon-politicians-candidates.html}{embraces
a conspiracy theory} that the F.B.I. has labeled a potential domestic
terrorism threat, is likely to unsettle mainstream Republicans, who have
sought to publicly distance themselves from QAnon supporters running for
congressional office this cycle even as they quietly support some of
them.

Ms. Greene defeated John Cowan, a neurosurgeon who is no less
conservative or pro-Trump, in Georgia's 14th Congressional District, one
of the most Republican in the country. As of Wednesday morning, she
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/11/us/elections/results-connecticut-georgia-minnesota-wisconsin-primaries.html?action=click\&pgtype=Article\&state=default\&module=styln-elections-2020\&region=TOP_BANNER\&context=storylines_menu}{led
by 14 percentage points}.

The president
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1293525010523578375}{congratulated
her in a tweet} Wednesday morning, calling her a ``future Republican
star'' who is ``strong on everything.''

QAnon, a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/01/us/politics/what-is-qanon.html}{conspiracy
theory} that has attracted a fervent following since it emerged from the
troll-infested fringes of the internet nearly three years ago, has
already inspired real-world violence, including
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/21/nyregion/gambino-shooting-anthony-comello-frank-cali.html}{the
killing of a mob boss}. Its supporters are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/politics/qanon-politicians-candidates.html}{slowly
becoming a political force} that some Republicans feel they cannot
afford to alienate, even as the party struggles to distance itself from
racist and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

More than a dozen candidates who have expressed some degree of support
for QAnon have run this year for Congress as Republicans, their path
cleared by Mr. Trump's own espousal of conspiracy theories.

Most are going to lose. But a few, Ms. Greene foremost among them, have
managed to win primaries against Republicans whose only real ideological
difference was that they don't believe in QAnon.
