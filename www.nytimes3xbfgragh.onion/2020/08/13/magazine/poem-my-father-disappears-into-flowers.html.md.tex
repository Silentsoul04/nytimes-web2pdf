Poetry forever grants us leaps and blurs. Sometimes it's not enough to
be where we are. Sometimes we need to be everywhere: present with the
lost, held by transient blossoms. Jan Beatty's new poems in ``The Body
Wars'' shimmer with luminous connection, travel a big life and grand map
of encounters. Deeper breath feels present in the poem's original uses
of punctuation --- stanzas, even a last one, ending with a colon. More
to come? Always more. Most important, ``he's not gone'' floats by
itself, the truth a daughter tunes to. \emph{Selected by Naomi Shihab

\emph{By Jan Beatty}

The apple tree in the backyard with white waterfall blossoms:

my father's body disappearing in his sickness down to 90 lbs,\\
his hat floating on his head:

my father falling into the clothes rack trying to buy\\
smaller pants to fit ---

he's not gone

The air heavy with waterfall, and him ---\\
vaulting down the front steps in spring:
