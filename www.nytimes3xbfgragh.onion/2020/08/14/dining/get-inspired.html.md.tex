Hi! And welcome to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/five-weeknight-dishes}{Five
Weeknight Dishes}. What day is it again? Oh, right. It's Friday. Happy
Friday! (Does T.G.I.F. mean anything to anyone anymore?) If your life is
like mine right now, each day blends into the next. I wake, I drink
coffee, I make what feels like 463 meals, I send approximately 1,232
emails, I break up 56 fights between my kids, then I collapse into bed
and sleep. Rinse and repeat.

Meals have gotten a little rote in this house, too. (How many times have
I made
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1017937-mississippi-roast}{slow-cooker
Mississippi roast} during the pandemic? I'm ashamed to say.) I don't
really have time for project cooking these days, but I am looking to
inject something new into our rotation. The dishes below have bright,
interesting flavors, but don't require a lot of work, and the leftovers
are almost the best part.

Have a lovely week. Need to reach me? Shoot me a note at

Salmon With Scallions and Zucchini}}

Yakitori is a traditional Japanese dish made with boneless chicken
that's seasoned with a salty-sweet soy basting sauce, then threaded onto
skewers and grilled. This riff, from Kay Chun, applies that technique to
salmon and vegetables with crazy-good results. I'm excited to try it
with extra-firm tofu, and I'll serve it with piles of fluffy rice.

Chicken Thighs With Black Beans, Rice and Chiles}}

I love this Mexican-influenced recipe from Diana Henry's book, ``From
the Oven to the Table: Simple Dishes That Look After Themselves.'' It's
a super easy all-in-one meal that's so good the first bite is kind of
shocking. It's almost as if you don't deserve such deliciousness for
such little effort, but of course you do.

Bulgogi Bolognese}}

My crew loves this salty-sweet Korean-Italian mash-up. Another brilliant
Kay Chun recipe, it comes together pretty quickly for a meat sauce
(about 45 minutes). Serve it over buttered egg noodles, and, if you like
heat, stir in a little gochujang. A
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1017629-chinese-smashed-cucumbers-with-sesame-oil-and-garlic}{cold
cucumber salad} alongside evens everything out.

Tofu With Peanut Sauce and Coconut-Lime Rice}}

Even those who think they don't like tofu love this saucy, peanuty dish
from Yewande Komolafe that's inspired by mafe, a groundnut stew that's
popular across West Africa. The tofu soaks up the sauce's flavors, and
the edges crisp and caramelize in the oven. The tender coconut-lime rice
is a perfect counterpoint.

Goddess Dip}}

Hi, it's me again: the Dip for Dinner Lady. This verdant one is made by
combining lots of fresh herbs, Greek yogurt and feta in a blender or
food processor. I once served it as an appetizer at a party, and one
guest asked if she could have a bowl and spoon so she could eat it like
soup. (True story!) For dinner, I serve this on a platter with lots of
cut vegetables, torn pieces of rotisserie chicken and fresh pita.
