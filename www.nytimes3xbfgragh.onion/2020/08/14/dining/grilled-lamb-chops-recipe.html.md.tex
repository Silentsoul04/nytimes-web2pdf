\section{When Lamb Chops Met
Romaine}\label{when-lamb-chops-met-romaine}}

The combination of grilled lamb chops, crisp romaine lettuce hearts and
creamy ranch dressing is almost a salad, but not quite.

There are some summer evenings so steamy that the only thing I can bear
to eat is a giant bowl of leafy salad. And this whole month of August
has been full of those kinds of nights, one sticky sunset after the
next.

But on what must have been our umpteenth salad, something had to give.
Surely adding just a few dainty lamb chops to a whole lot of romaine
wouldn't disqualify it from salad status --- just as long as I kept the
balance of charred meat to lettuce decidedly in the romaine's favor.

The result is what I like to think of as a sort-of salad: meaty and
satisfying, but still fresh and sprightly enough for any late-summer
evening.

You can use any type of lamb chops here, but pricier rib and loin chops
will be leaner than economical shoulder chops, which tend to be fattier
and gristlier. (I write this with love for fat and gristle.) Cooking
shoulder chops to medium-rare helps caramelize the fat and tenderize the
meat while still keeping them juicy on the inside; loin and rib chops
can be as rare as you like.

If you did spring for a great piece of lamb, the usual rule is not to
marinate it first. A little salt is all you need to bring out its
brawny, mineral essence.

This said, I've never met a lamb chop that wasn't improved by a little
garlic and some herbs. Both are used in profusion in this dark green
seasoning paste, which I rub onto the chops about 30 minutes before
grilling --- or the day before if I've planned ahead.

That herb paste serves another function as well. After smearing some on
the lamb, the rest is mixed with mayonnaise and buttermilk and turned
into a creamy, tangy ranch dressing for this sort-of salad.

Romaine hearts make a cool, crisp contrast to the char and savory juices
of the meat. But floppy lettuces and arugula are also salad-worthy,
albeit in a soft rather than crunchy way.

But really, when you have tender lamb chops and homemade ranch dressing
together in one dish, any kind of vegetable will be happy to join in,
whether tomatoes, grilled zucchini or a pile of sliced cucumbers or
radishes. Or try them all and skip the lamb entirely. You'll have plenty
of chances as August burns on.
