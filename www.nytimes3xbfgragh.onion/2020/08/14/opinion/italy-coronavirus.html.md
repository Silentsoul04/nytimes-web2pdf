SANTA MARGHERITA, Italy — In Italy there are seasons — and then there is
*the* season. Summer comes, the country’s woes are set aside, and, to
the eternal refrain of “tutti al mare” ** (“Everyone to the sea”), the
exodus to the consoling coast begins. The national debt fades between
sea and stars.

This year is a little different. Masks dangle from ears in the new
insouciant look or are tied around elbows then used for a bump-greeting.
Beach chairs are (anti-) socially distanced. With stores operating
two-at-a-time limits, the line for focaccia is so long that people read
an entire newspaper (and Italians *still* read them) as they wait.
Americans have almost vanished, as have the Russians. Children’s beach
chatter revolves around the all-canceling virus*,* which gives a new
edge to games of tag.

The difference is the coronavirus, lurking like the knowledge that
summer will end. Contained, almost defeated, yet out there beyond the
drone of the chirping cicadas, leaving Italians in a limbo between
liberation and fear.

Among Western nations, Italy was the first to be hit hard by the
pandemic. The country learned the [loneliness of a new form of
death](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/27/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-bergamo.html).
Its doctors battled in extremis. It watched army trucks transporting
coffins to remote cremation sites from the overloaded morgues of
Bergamo.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then, strange thing, after some initial missteps, Italy did what it has
had the most difficulty doing since the unification of the peninsula in
1861: It cohered into a nation and brought a fierce national will to
bear on the virus. It went into disciplined lockdown. It set aside,
through a unified front, the old slurs exchanged between northerners and
southerners, the old parochialism of city-states with longer histories
than the nation they find themselves in, the old derision directed at
its politics.

I am tempted to say that 2020 was the year of Italy’s emergence, 159
years after the Piedmont statesman Massimo d’Azeglio declared: “We have
made Italy. Now we have to make Italians.” Perhaps that’s an
exaggeration, but not without its truth.

Italy brought its rate of new infections — now [about eight per 100,000
inhabitants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-cases.html)
— down to one of the lowest in Europe, lower even than
[Germany](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-cases.html).
It did so as the United States, which spent untold postwar treasure on
keeping Italy stable, threw its doors open to the pandemic through
leaderless fracture. This, in contrast to Italy, has been the season of
American unraveling.

I mentioned the buzzing cicadas and their summer crescendo. In Aesop’s
fable generally known in English as “The Ant and the Grasshopper,” but
in Italian as “La Formica e la Cicala” (“The Ant and the Cicada”), the
industrious ant spends its summer laying in supplies for the winter
while the carefree cicada passes the time singing, or, as Italians
describe improvident laziness, scratching its belly. When winter comes,
as it does, the starving cicada begs the ant for food. The ant,
vindicated, tells it to go dance away the winter.

Writing the other day in Milan’s Corriere della Sera, [Antonio Scurati
asked](https://www.corriere.it/editoriali/20_agosto_11/alla-ricerca-normalitatra-pericolosi-cicaleggi-estivi-99a9717c-dc06-11ea-abc9-41b5baff53c0.shtml):
“Dear reader, are you a cicada or an ant?” His fear, he said, was that
Italians were tending cicada. The sun is shining, *let’s live a bit* and
believe that the emergency has passed forever.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In this Phase 2 of the virus, with a rise in cases in countries
including Spain and France, it’s an ant-or-cicada moment in many
societies. I confess to being something of a cicada by inclination, not
in slothful tendencies I hope, but in the belief that a life lived in
fear and obsessive prudence is not worth living. How to weigh the
cicada’s chirping pleasure against the ant’s cautious husbandry, a
short happy life against a long inhibited one?

The answer is not evident. As with most things in life, it lies in
balance. It’s equally hard to say at what point reasonable, lifesaving
precaution over the virus becomes unreasonable, job-destroying,
school-closing and life-quenching fear — harder still because rampant
fear was a striking characteristic of many societies *before* the virus.
For Italy, the overriding question is how not to suffer a chaotic
relapse from the crisis-induced effectiveness of national unity.

There will be renewed division and disappointments, but I don’t believe
anything can undo what Italy revealed of itself. Italy had a good war.
To a degree unimaginable in Donald Trump’s America, and beyond even that
of many Europeans, Italians showed what long history teaches: civic
wisdom.

A summer fairy tale gripped Italy. It centered on Atalanta, the small
soccer club of Bergamo, the northern town that was the virus’s
epicenter. Against all odds, Atalanta reached the quarterfinal of
Europe’s premier club competition, the Champions League, where, in an
empty stadium, it played Paris St. Germain, the French capital’s rich
Qatari-owned club. When Atalanta took the lead in the first half, a loud
cheer coursed down the Italian peninsula.

I watched the game this week with Antonio Colpani and Laura Vergani,
both from Bergamo. Colpani told me of his mother’s near death and his
own battle with the virus. Vergani recalled the constant sirens and how
one day they stopped because the streets were empty anyway and local
authorities had concluded that the sound spread panic.

“We beat it,” Colpani said. “Non mollare mai.” He smiled as he uttered
the phrase — *Never give up —* by which Bergamo lives. “Mola mia” in
Bergamasco dialect.

Atalanta, unyielding, [clung to its 1-0 lead until the last
minute](https://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=573701). Then Paris
St-Germain scored, and a moment later scored again to win 2-1.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It would have been wonderful for the fairy tale to continue, but perhaps
for Italy the agonizing defeat was a useful reality check in this summer
limbo, a grain of ant in the song of the cicada.

“That’s life,” Colpani said, “Everything can change in a minute.”
