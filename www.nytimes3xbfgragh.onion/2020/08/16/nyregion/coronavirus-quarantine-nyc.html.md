Earlier this summer, Sasha Pagan burst into tears during her nursing
shift at a hospital on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.

It had been a normal day in the pediatric unit, apart from the masks and
the Covid-19 protocols, when a patient arrived for some testing. She was
screened at the front door, answering “no” when asked whether she had
traveled outside of New York state within the past two weeks, currently
a prerequisite for nonemergency medical treatment. But at the end of the
appointment, the patient admitted to having been in Florida six days
earlier.

Ms. Pagan, who works with adolescents and young adults, was furious.
“The patient lied and exposed staff,” she said. “Me, registrars,
techs, everyone.”

The pandemic has been brutal for Ms. Pagan, who was sick with Covid-19
herself and lost her uncle to it earlier this year. “This patient was
very triggering for me,” she said. “These people are coming in for
routine lab work. It wasn’t anything urgent, and that is why I got
really upset. It was something that could have waited.”

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has mandated that travelers entering New York from
other states where positive test results of the coronavirus exceed 10
percent must be quarantined for 14 days. [Over 30
states](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoZW6tJyR6wIVSeG1Ch1VkgGJEAAYASAAEgKV1PD_BwE)
are currently on the quarantine list, along with Puerto Rico. New York
state officials are in charge of [monitoring the
airports](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory).
And earlier this month, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced [checkpoints at
bridges and
tunnels](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-quarantine-checkpoints.html)
throughout the city in an effort to inform travelers about the rules.
However, many Americans, antsy to travel again, seem to be making up
their own.

“Safely separating upon your arrival home is your civic duty to
yourself, your neighbors and your loved ones,” said Avery Cohen, deputy
press secretary for the mayor, adding that city officials are knocking
on doors, in addition to calling and texting New Yorkers about the new
virus guidelines. Mr. de Blasio, speaking earlier this month of the
checkpoints, said, “We’re not going to let our hard work slip away.”

Where the government may struggle to track travelers, however, social
media is capturing their exploits. Many of those thwarting mandatory
quarantines are posting about their trips and outings around the city on
Facebook and Instagram, which is frustrating and alarming New
Yorkers.

Olivia Awe, a figure skating coach and pastry chef, noticed on social
media that an acquaintance from college would be returning to New York
City after temporarily living with her parents in Florida. The
acquaintance had stopped in Virginia, another high-risk state, on her
way back, to attend a wedding that didn’t require masks. Ms. Awe spotted
Snapchat and Instagram stories detailing the event, she said.

Then the woman was back in New York. “I saw a post on her social media
about how she was given the paper stating she needed to quarantine,”
said Ms. Awe, 22, who soon thereafter noticed even more posts
chronicling the acquaintances’s adventures around the city. The college
friend was now bar hopping, eating out at restaurants, and hosting a
group of people at her apartment.

Ms. Awe and another friend tried to report the errant young woman, but
they could only figure out how to turn in a business, not an individual.
“If told how to go about reporting this person I would without
hesitation,” she said. “This person is putting so many people at risk
and putting our state at risk.”

And it’s not just young people bending quarantine rules. Earlier this
summer, a private Facebook chat group of parents whose children attend a
well-known art and design school in the city addressed how to move their
college-age children to New York City, without committing to the full
quarantine first, according to a member of the group, who spoke under
condition of anonymity.

Parents in the chat group applauded one post that stated the city
couldn’t enforce the quarantine, she said, which left her so spooked
that she persuaded her daughter to defer her freshman year.

New Yorkers who have been strict since March are also noticing some of
their friends and neighbors skirt quarantine rules, which makes them
second-guess their own standards.

For the first time since the pandemic started, Miri Castor, a graduate
science student in Brooklyn, only recently started feeling comfortable
taking short walks around her neighborhood. “I have been staying in,”
she said. “I have a backyard, where I can go to get a bunch of
sunshine.” Even now that her lab is open, she goes there as little as
possible, and then heads straight
home.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

“I know people are tired of quarantining and the cost of travel has gone
down,” said Ms. Castor, 26. “But they seem to take pride in it. They are
like, ‘We are going out, we are going to have fun.’”

She also knows her efforts will be in vain if no one else takes the same
precautions. “Sometimes it’s like, ‘Wow, am I the issue here?’ Maybe I
am just terrified to go out.”

Ms. Castor might be heartened by the efforts of Logan and Lindsay Davis,
who moved to New York City from Provo, Utah, in July. When their flight
arrived at Kennedy International Airport, there were no officials there
to screen them or track them, Mr. Davis said. “We just showed up at the
airport and left,” he continued. “We didn’t get screened or tested. No
one asked for our address or anything.”

But the couple still quarantined for the full two weeks. “We know New
York was the main hot spot for a long time, and we wanted to make sure
we were not contributing to that,” said Mr. Davis, a 27-year-old
middle-school teacher.

They rented an Airbnb in Harlem, where they had their groceries
delivered. Ms. Davis, 24, a student, focused on classwork, while her
husband read. “I bought a ton of books, so I escaped into different
worlds like ‘World War Z’ and ‘The Time Machine,’” Mr. Davis said. “I’m
reading ‘Little Women’ right now, anything to keep my mind occupied.”

On the couple’s 15th day in New York, they walked around Central Park
for hours and met friends downtown where they ate bagels in the park and
got ice cream in the West Village.

“It really wasn’t that bad,” Mr. Davis said. “Everybody should do it.”
