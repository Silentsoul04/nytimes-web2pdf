It.}\label{new-york-has-a-14-day-quarantine-many-new-yorkers-are-ignoring-it}}

Travelers returning from states with high infection rates say they are
following the rules, but their social media posts say otherwise.

Earlier this summer, Sasha Pagan burst into tears during her nursing
shift at a hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

It had been a normal day in the pediatric unit, apart from the masks and
the Covid-19 protocols, when a patient arrived for some testing. She was
screened at the front door, answering ``no'' when asked whether she had
traveled outside of New York state within the past two weeks, currently
a prerequisite for nonemergency medical treatment. But at the end of the
appointment, the patient admitted to having been in Florida six days
earlier.

Ms. Pagan, who works with adolescents and young adults, was furious.
``The patient lied and exposed staff,'' she said. ``Me, registrars,
techs, everyone.''

The pandemic has been brutal for Ms. Pagan, who was sick with Covid-19
herself and lost her uncle to it earlier this year. ``This patient was
very triggering for me,'' she said. ``These people are coming in for
routine lab work. It wasn't anything urgent, and that is why I got
really upset. It was something that could have waited.''

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has mandated that travelers entering New York from
other states where positive test results of the coronavirus exceed 10
percent must be quarantined for 14 days.
\href{https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoZW6tJyR6wIVSeG1Ch1VkgGJEAAYASAAEgKV1PD_BwE}{Over
30 states} are currently on the quarantine list, along with Puerto Rico.
New York state officials are in charge of
\href{https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory}{monitoring
the airports}. And earlier this month, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-quarantine-checkpoints.html}{checkpoints
at bridges and tunnels} throughout the city in an effort to inform
travelers about the rules. However, many Americans, antsy to travel
again, seem to be making up their own.

``Safely separating upon your arrival home is your civic duty to
yourself, your neighbors and your loved ones,'' said Avery Cohen, deputy
press secretary for the mayor, adding that city officials are knocking
on doors, in addition to calling and texting New Yorkers about the new
virus guidelines. Mr. de Blasio, speaking earlier this month of the
checkpoints, said, ``We're not going to let our hard work slip away.''

Where the government may struggle to track travelers, however, social
media is capturing their exploits. Many of those thwarting mandatory
quarantines are posting about their trips and outings around the city on
Facebook and Instagram, which is frustrating and alarming New Yorkers.

Olivia Awe, a figure skating coach and pastry chef, noticed on social
media that an acquaintance from college would be returning to New York
City after temporarily living with her parents in Florida. The
acquaintance had stopped in Virginia, another high-risk state, on her
way back, to attend a wedding that didn't require masks. Ms. Awe spotted
Snapchat and Instagram stories detailing the event, she said.

Then the woman was back in New York. ``I saw a post on her social media
about how she was given the paper stating she needed to quarantine,''
said Ms. Awe, 22, who soon thereafter noticed even more posts
chronicling the acquaintances's adventures around the city. The college
friend was now bar hopping, eating out at restaurants, and hosting a
group of people at her apartment.

Ms. Awe and another friend tried to report the errant young woman, but
they could only figure out how to turn in a business, not an individual.
``If told how to go about reporting this person I would without
hesitation,'' she said. ``This person is putting so many people at risk
and putting our state at risk.''

And it's not just young people bending quarantine rules. Earlier this
summer, a private Facebook chat group of parents whose children attend a
well-known art and design school in the city addressed how to move their
college-age children to New York City, without committing to the full
quarantine first, according to a member of the group, who spoke under
condition of anonymity.

Parents in the chat group applauded one post that stated the city
couldn't enforce the quarantine, she said, which left her so spooked
that she persuaded her daughter to defer her freshman year.

New Yorkers who have been strict since March are also noticing some of
their friends and neighbors skirt quarantine rules, which makes them
second-guess their own standards.

For the first time since the pandemic started, Miri Castor, a graduate
science student in Brooklyn, only recently started feeling comfortable
taking short walks around her neighborhood. ``I have been staying in,''
she said. ``I have a backyard, where I can go to get a bunch of
sunshine.'' Even now that her lab is open, she goes there as little as
possible, and then heads straight home.

    The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth

    that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground
    within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that
    guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch
    droplets a lot farther than six feet,
    \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852}{according
    to a recent study}. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest
    standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But
    keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough

    immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the

But on social media, she sees her peers acting differently. They are
going to parties on the beach and barbecues. A few have taken trips to
Florida or the Caribbean and gone to New York City parties soon after
they left the airport.

``I know people are tired of quarantining and the cost of travel has
gone down,'' said Ms. Castor, 26. ``But they seem to take pride in it.
They are like, `We are going out, we are going to have fun.'''

She also knows her efforts will be in vain if no one else takes the same
precautions. ``Sometimes it's like, `Wow, am I the issue here?' Maybe I
am just terrified to go out.''

Ms. Castor might be heartened by the efforts of Logan and Lindsay Davis,
who moved to New York City from Provo, Utah, in July. When their flight
arrived at Kennedy International Airport, there were no officials there
to screen them or track them, Mr. Davis said. ``We just showed up at the
airport and left,'' he continued. ``We didn't get screened or tested. No
one asked for our address or anything.''

But the couple still quarantined for the full two weeks. ``We know New
York was the main hot spot for a long time, and we wanted to make sure
we were not contributing to that,'' said Mr. Davis, a 27-year-old
middle-school teacher.

They rented an Airbnb in Harlem, where they had their groceries
delivered. Ms. Davis, 24, a student, focused on classwork, while her
husband read. ``I bought a ton of books, so I escaped into different
worlds like `World War Z' and `The Time Machine,''' Mr. Davis said.
``I'm reading `Little Women' right now, anything to keep my mind
occupied.''

On the couple's 15th day in New York, they walked around Central Park
for hours and met friends downtown where they ate bagels in the park and
got ice cream in the West Village.

``It really wasn't that bad,'' Mr. Davis said. ``Everybody should do
it.''
