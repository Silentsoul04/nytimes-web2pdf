Perilous}\label{protests-grow-in-thailand-where-speaking-out-can-be-perilous}}

Demonstrators are demanding change in a country with a long history of
suppressing dissent. Some protesters are even defying the taboo against
criticizing the monarchy.

BANGKOK --- They gathered at a monument celebrating Thai democracy. They
raised their hands in defiance below a giant image of the king dressed
in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/04/world/asia/thailand-king-maha-vajiralongkorn.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{coronation
regalia}.

At least 10,000 protesters, many first-time participants in political
rallies, gathered in Bangkok on Sunday, demanding change in a country
where military tanks have tended to shape politics more than the ballot
box has.

The nearly eight-hour protest, which filled a broad avenue in the heart
of the city with black-clad people, was the largest
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/world/asia/thailand-arrests-protests.html}{rally
in Thailand} since a coup in 2014, one of a dozen successful putsches in
the country in the last nine decades.

A state of emergency instituted because of the coronavirus made the
demonstration technically illegal, and every participant could have been
arrested simply for showing up. The police stood by, however, some
idling behind a Mercedes-Benz showroom.

Thailand's growing protest movement, which was set off by student
activism last month, has since gained broader support.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/16/world/16thailand2/merlin_175320015_6c802a9f-eb22-4f60-aa91-9e3601234fb6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

While Thailand has escaped the brunt of the pandemic, it has been
pummeled economically, and millions are out of work. With Prayuth
Chan-ocha, the retired general who choreographed the last coup, still
leading the country as prime minister, Thais have intensified calls for
a new political order.

``We have had many political divisions in our country but now, no matter
what our backgrounds, many of us are united in questioning the
legitimacy of this government,'' said Nuttaa ** Mahattana, a democracy
activist. ``Look at who's here, many different types of people.''

The protest leaders have demanded a new constitution, one not written by
the military, as the current charter was. They have called for
Parliament to dissolve. They are pleading for the protection of human
rights at a time when vocal
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/world/asia/thailand-dissidents-disappeared-military.html}{critics
of the military and monarchy have disappeared} and been killed. And they
say they will keep gathering if their aims are not met.

``We don't hate the country, but we hate you, Prayuth Chan-ocha,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/asia/thailand-student-protest-military.html}{Benjamaporn
Nivas}, a 15-year-old student, sang from the stage she shared with
others, taking the melody of a children's song and adding new lyrics.
``We don't want dictatorship.''

Sunday's protest took place at the Democracy Monument, which was built
to commemorate the 1932 bloodless revolution that ended absolute
monarchy in Thailand. The country is now a constitutional monarchy, but
some of the protest leaders have accused the palace of breaching the
terms of that form of government.

King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun spends little time in
Thailand, living most of the year in Europe. He has consolidated
financial and military power,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/17/world/asia/thailand-king-assets.html}{bringing
crown coffers} and influential army units under his control.

After some protesters called for
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/13/world/asia/protests-thailand-king-monarchy.html}{checks
on the palace's power} in rallies last week, a rare challenge in a
country where lèse-majesté laws can land critics of the crown in jail
for up to 15 years, the authorities pressured the movement's leaders to
keep the monarchy out of their speeches.

But as Sunday's rally stretched into the night, after speeches on labor
law, student haircuts and rights for gay, lesbian and transgender
people, Arnon Nampa, a young human rights lawyer, took to the stage and
defied any such request. Earlier, a laser had projected a hashtag that
asked in Thai, ``why do we need a king?'' onto the white face of the
Democracy Monument.

The authorities ``have asked us to stop dreaming,'' he said, referring
to ``the biggest dream of seeing the monarchy stay alongside Thai
society,'' rather than floating above it unbound by legal charters.

``I am announcing here,'' he added, ``that we will continue dreaming.''

The demonstration took place under a large photograph of the king during
his 2019 coronation, when he was formally presented with a 16-pound
golden crown and a fortune that makes him one of the world's richest
royals.

Above the orderly rows of protesters was also an oversize picture of
Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, the king's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/06/world/asia/thailand-king-consort-wives.html}{fourth
wife}, in a military uniform. A former flight attendant, she has been
given the military rank of general in the king's bodyguard corps.

A pro-royalist counterprotest gathered on Sunday as well. Its numbers
were small.

Even before the protest kicked off, the Thai security apparatus had
begun harassing those who might want to speak out. Mr. Arnon was
arrested on sedition charges last week. He and another activist are also
facing lèse-majesté complaints.

Early on Sunday morning, Pongsak Phusitsakul, an opposition politician
whose party was dissolved before it was able to contest elections last
year, said his dogs alerted him to six plainclothes police officers who
went to his home, he said, to intimidate him ahead of the rally.

``I'm used to it,'' he said. ``But I'm worried about the youth, what
they will face and what their parents and families have to face.''

Previous Thai protests have been crushed with force, with dozens killed
in downtown Bangkok, students included.

Even though many of the protesters on Sunday were posting selfies on
Instagram and Facebook --- at least when the internet hadn't slowed to a
crawl --- few of the first-time participants wanted to give their names.

A 17-year-old high school student stood at the rally holding a small,
handmade sign that said ``Dictatorship shall perish! Long live
democracy.'' She posed willingly for a picture but balked at identifying
herself.

She had told her parents she was going to the movies. Somehow, she said,
she had ended up at the protest instead.

Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.
