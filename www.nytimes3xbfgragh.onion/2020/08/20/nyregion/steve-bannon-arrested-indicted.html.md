[Stephen K.
Bannon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/nyregion/steve-bannon-build-the-wall-fraud.html),
President Trump’s former adviser and an architect of his 2016 general
election campaign, was charged on Thursday with defrauding donors to a
private fund-raising effort called We Build the Wall, which was intended
to bolster the president’s signature initiative along the Mexican
border.

Mr. Bannon, working with a wounded Air Force veteran and a Florida
venture capitalist, conspired to cheat hundreds of thousands of donors
by falsely promising that their money had been set aside for new
sections of wall, according to a federal indictment unsealed in
Manhattan.

The fund-raising effort collected more than $25 million, and prosecutors
said Mr. Bannon used nearly $1 million of it for personal expenses.

Despite the populist aura he tries to project, Mr. Bannon is known to
enjoy the high life, and he was arrested at 7:15 a.m. on a $35 million,
150-foot yacht belonging to one of his business associates, [the
fugitive Chinese billionaire Guo
Wengui](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/23/us/politics/steve-bannon-guo-wengui.html),
law enforcement officials said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Working with the Coast Guard, special agents from the United States
attorney’s office in Manhattan and federal postal inspectors boarded the
yacht off Westbrook, Conn., the officials said. Mr. Bannon, 66, was on
deck, drinking coffee and reading a book, when the raid occurred.

The criminal charges, filed a week before Mr. Trump was to accept the
Republican nomination for a second term, marked a stark turn of fortune
for the flamboyant political strategist. Mr. Bannon first came to
prominence when he was in charge of the right-wing media outlet
Breitbart, where he had aligned himself with the alt-right, a loose
network of groups and people who promote white identity.

As chief strategist, Mr. Bannon was one of the most powerful figures in
the White House early in the Trump administration, but he [stepped down
in
August 2017](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/18/us/politics/steve-bannon-trump-white-house.html)
after frequently clashing with other aides.

With the indictment, Mr. Bannon became the seventh Trump associate to
have been charged with federal crimes, a list that includes Paul
Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager; Michael T. Flynn, the
former national security adviser; and Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s
onetime lawyer and fixer.

The 24-page indictment, unsealed in Federal District Court in Manhattan,
is by far the most politically sensitive case that Audrey Strauss, the
acting United States attorney in Manhattan, has handled since she
assumed her job after her predecessor, [Geoffrey S. Berman, was fired in
June by Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/nyregion/trump-geoffrey-berman-fired-sdny.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At a brief arraignment on Thursday, Mr. Bannon, sunburned and his hair
unbrushed, pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud conspiracy and
money laundering conspiracy, each of which carries a maximum penalty of
20 years in prison. The government agreed to release him from custody on
a $5 million bond.

Walking to his car after being freed, Mr. Bannon said, “This entire
fiasco is to stop people who want to build the wall.”

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shortly after the charges were announced, Mr. Trump had sought to
distance himself from Mr. Bannon and the fund-raising initiative, though
the president also expressed sympathy for his former adviser.

“I feel very badly,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “I
haven’t been dealing with him for a very long period of time.”

The president said he knew nothing about the multimillion-dollar We
Build the Wall campaign but quickly contradicted himself.

“I don’t like that project,” Mr. Trump said. “I thought it was being
done for showboating reasons.” He called paying for the border wall
privately “inappropriate.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of Mr. Trump’s sons, Donald Jr., publicly promoted the We Build the
Wall effort at an [event
in 2019](https://thewallsymposium.com/coalition-of-immigration-national-security-and-border-experts-convene-a-crisis-at-the-border-symposium-at-the-wall-directly-on-the-us-mexico-border/),
calling it “private enterprise at its finest.”

Donald Trump Jr. said in a statement on Thursday that he had no
involvement with the effort beyond praising it at that one event.

A White House official said that President Trump did not know Mr. Bannon
would be arrested, and that he was told by aides after it happened.

Attorney General William P. Barr was briefed on the investigation
several months ago, according to a Justice Department official, and the
federal prosecutor’s office in Manhattan gave him notice that the
indictment would be unsealed on Thursday.

According to the authorities, Mr. Bannon hatched the plot to defraud the
donors with three other men: Brian Kolfage, a 38-year-old Air Force
veteran and triple amputee from Miramar Beach, Fla.; Andrew Badolato,
56, a venture capitalist from Sarasota, Fla.; and Timothy Shea, 49, of
Castle Rock, Colo.

Mr. Kolfage and Mr. Badolato were arrested in Florida on Thursday, and
Mr. Shea, who prosecutors said funneled money for the group through a
shell company he owned, was arrested in Denver.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kolfage, who lost both his legs and one of his arms during his
service in Iraq, created We Build the Wall as a GoFundMe page in
December 2018. It was an immediate success, raising nearly $17 million
in its first week online, prosecutors said.

To persuade potential donors to contribute to the effort, prosecutors
said, Mr. Kolfage promised them that he would “not take a penny in
salary or compensation” and that all of the money he raised would be
used “in the execution of our mission and purpose.” According to the
indictment, Mr. Bannon described We Build the Wall as a “volunteer
organization.”

But all of that was false, prosecutors said. Instead, they claimed, Mr.
Kolfage secretly took more than $350,000 in donations and spent it on
home renovations, boat payments, a luxury S.U.V., a golf cart, jewelry
and cosmetic surgery.

Mr. Bannon, working through an unnamed nonprofit organization, received
more than $1 million from We Build the Wall, prosecutors said, some of
which he used to pay off hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal
expenses.

## Read the document

Mr. Bannon and three others are accused in a scheme to use funds raised
for construction to pay for personal expenses.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Court papers suggested that prosecutors were in possession of several
text messages between the men, including one in which Mr. Kolfage told
Mr. Badolato that the payment scheme was “confidential” and should be
kept on a “need to know” basis.

Mr. Kolfage initially pitched We Build the Wall as a way to sidestep the
considerable legal and political obstacles to erecting Mr. Trump’s
long-sought barrier. While the group has [drawn approval from some top
Homeland Security and Border Patrol
officials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/us/politics/bannon-we-build-the-wall.html),
it has also prompted a backlash over its connections to Mr. Trump’s
associates and its construction methods.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The federal government has built parts of the wall well within the
American side of the border on federally owned land. But the sections
built with private funds — slightly less than five miles in all,
according to We Build the Wall’s website — have been erected along the
riverbank of the Rio Grande in New Mexico and Texas.

Environmental groups have challenged those portions, citing potential
harm. When [experts recently
said](https://www.propublica.org/article/he-built-a-privately-funded-border-wall-its-already-at-risk-of-falling-down-if-not-fixed)
that sections along the river could fall into the river, even Mr. Trump
criticized the project.

It remained unclear precisely when the yearlong investigation into the
alleged scheme began. But last year, a bank informed Mr. Bannon that
federal prosecutors had subpoenaed records related to We Build the Wall,
according to a person briefed on the matter.

Prosecutors said that despite the effort’s early success, there were
questions almost instantly “about Mr. Kolfage’s background” and the
viability of his promises to use the money he had raised to actually
build Mr. Trump’s wall.

Because of these concerns, prosecutors said, GoFundMe warned Mr. Kolfage
that if he did not find a “legitimate nonprofit organization” to handle
the money, it would return it to the donors. Mr. Kolfage claimed that
the group had determined that only $800,000 of the funds needed to be
given back.

“No rules were broken,” he said in an interview last year.

As the problems with donors mounted, Mr. Kolfage said he would establish
a board of advisers and incorporate the group as [We Build the Wall
Inc.](https://webuildthewall.us/team/)

Mr. Kolfage enlisted Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state,
to serve on the board. Mr. Kobach, a longtime Trump supporter and a
prominent immigration hard-liner, was not named in the indictment.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Kolfage also brought in Mr. Bannon, who had joined Mr. Trump’s
campaign as chief executive in August 2016 and later became the White
House’s chief strategist.

Several times, prosecutors said, Mr. Kolfage falsely assured his donors
that every dime they gave him would go to the wall.

“It’s not possible to steal the money,” he said at one point, according
to the indictment. “We have an advisory committee.”

When special agents from the Manhattan federal prosecutor’s office and
postal inspectors boarded Mr. Guo’s yacht, the Lady May, in Long Island
Sound, they searched the vessel and seized Mr. Bannon’s cellphone,
officials said.

The investigators also conducted other searches in Florida, Colorado,
Nevada, Missouri and Virginia, including at the homes of all of the
defendants, the officials said.

Mr. Guo, a real-estate magnate, has been in exile since 2014 after
fleeing China in anticipation of corruption and rape allegations by its
government.

While living abroad — sometimes at a palatial apartment overlooking
Central Park in Manhattan — he forged relationships with China
hard-liners like Mr. Bannon and bought [a membership to Mr. Trump’s
Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach,
Fla.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-tycoon-holed-up-in-manhattan-hotel-is-accused-of-spying-for-beijing-11563810726)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Almost immediately after leaving the White House, Mr. Bannon struck up
lucrative financial ties to Mr. Guo that began with a $150,000 loan,
according to a memo written in May 2019 and obtained by The New York
Times.

The GoFundMe page through which Mr. Bannon and his co-defendants raised
money is now inactive. On Wednesday, less than 24 hours before their
arrests, Mr. Kolfage made an appearance on Mr. Bannon’s podcast and
explained the deactivation as an example of how tech companies censor
conservative speech online.

When Mr. Bannon asked how people could continue giving money to the wall
campaign, Mr. Kolfage responded by directing potential donors to his
personal website, as well as another specifically for wall funding.

“How do people get access to We Build the Wall?” Mr. Bannon said.

“Don’t go to GoFundMe anymore,” Mr. Kolfage replied. “Screw them. Go
straight to our website.”
