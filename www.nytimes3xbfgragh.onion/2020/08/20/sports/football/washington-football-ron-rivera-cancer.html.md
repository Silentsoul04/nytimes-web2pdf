# Washington N.F.L. Team Coach Ron Rivera Says He Has Cancer

</div>

In a year of franchise turmoil, Rivera will undergo treatment for
carcinoma while helping to lead organizational change.

Ron Rivera, the first-year head coach of the Washington Football Team,
[revealed on
Thursday](https://twitter.com/WashingtonNFL/status/1296648726983868422)
that he had squamous cell carcinoma detected in a lymph node.

Rivera, 58, told the team of the diagnosis Thursday night and said he
would continue coaching even as he receives treatment, which can
severely compromise his immune system and raise his risk of infection
from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Rivera’s condition
was [first reported by
ESPN.](https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1296610136992161792)

Rivera sought treatment after a self-care check and said the cancer was
at an early stage and “very treatable.” “I was stunned,” Rivera told
ESPN. “But I was angry because I feel like I’m in best health I’ve been
in.”

Rivera has had a particularly heavy workload since joining the team
before this season. He not only has been trying to turn around a
flailing team, but has also dealt with changing the organization’s
troubled corporate culture.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rivera’s diagnosis comes during a critical phase of training camp, as
players and coaches began wearing pads in practices to get ready for the
upcoming season, which begins in just three weeks. [Training camps,
which have been altered this
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/sports/football/nfl-preseason-hall-of-fame.html)
to reduce the risk of infection from the coronavirus, include fewer
full-contact practices and in-person meetings and no preseason games.

Rivera is far from the first N.F.L. head coach to confront serious
health issues. Over the years, head coaches including John Fox of the
Denver Broncos and Bill Parcells of the Giants [stepped away from their
teams because of heart-related
illness](https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/2017/01/04/11-nfl-coaches-that-battled-health-problems-while-coaching/).

In September 2012, Chuck Pagano, then 51 and the coach of the
Indianapolis Colts, took an indefinite leave after a [leukemia
diagnosis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/04/sports/football/colts-try-to-focus-as-coach-chuck-pagano-fights-leukemia.html).
His illness became a rallying cry for the players, including quarterback
Andrew Luck, who wore [T-shirts with the phrase
“Chuckstrong](https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/12/24/chuck-pagano-cancer-leukemia-impact).”
That Christmas Eve, Pagano returned to work in time to see his team
qualify for the playoffs after finishing 2-14 the season before.

In 1970, Vince Lombardi was coaching in Washington when he [received a
colon cancer
diagnosis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1970/09/04/archives/vince-lombardi-football-coach-dies-vince-lombardi-pro-football.html)
and died less than three months later at 57.

None of these coaches, though, had to grapple with health issues during
a pandemic, and the risk of infection could change Rivera’s plans. He
told ESPN it was “business as usual” but that he had a “Plan B.”

Often, head coaches who temporarily step down appoint one of their
deputies to take over. [Rivera’s two main
lieutenants](https://www.washingtonfootball.com/team/coaches-roster/)
are Jack Del Rio — like Rivera, a former linebacker — and Scott Turner.
Now a defensive coordinator, Del Rio, 57, was a head coach for 12 years
with the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Oakland Raiders. Turner, 38, is a
first-year offensive coordinator and has been a [position coach at
several
colleges](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/TurnSc0.htm)
and with four other N.F.L. teams, most recently the Carolina Panthers,
where he was Rivera’s offensive coordinator. He is a son of Norv Turner,
who coached the Washington team from
1994-2000.

### Sports and the Virus

#### 

Updated Sept. 4, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - The 146th running of the Kentucky Derby, which was moved to
        Saturday from May 2, will have [no spectators present because of
        the coronavirus
        pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/sports/horse-racing/kentucky-derby-odds-picks.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup).
      - The coronavirus pandemic has had an [uneven impact on high
        school
        football](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/sports/ncaafootball/high-school-football-coronavirus-pandemic.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) across
        the United States.
      - The [most complicated puzzle in sports is the return of college
        athletics](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-cal-athletics-season.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) during
        a pandemic. The University of California, Berkeley is allowing
        The Times an inside look at their journey’s ups and downs.

Even before his diagnosis, Rivera was already thrust into one of the
most chaotic off-seasons any head coach has had to face. [Hired by team
owner Daniel
Snyder](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/31/sports/football/ron-rivera-washington-redskins.html)
at the end last season after being [fired by the
Panthers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/sports/football/why-was-ron-rivera-fired.html),
Rivera was presented as a new face of a franchise eager to ditch its
losing ways. The team has not made the postseason in five years and has
only won two playoff games since Snyder took over the franchise in 1999.

Rivera, who led the Panthers to the [playoffs four times in his nine
years](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/RiveRo0.htm)
there, brought in Turner, Del Rio and several front office personnel.
But his efforts to remake the team hit a wall when the pandemic forced
the N.F.L. to shut down all team facilities and ban all nonessential
travel. This forced Rivera and his new staff to work remotely and forgo
the in-person player interviews and tryouts essential to the recruiting
process. Like all teams, Washington held virtual off-season workouts.

Then George Floyd was killed while in police custody in Minneapolis at
the end of May, prompting a wave of protests around the country and
[renewed activism among
N.F.L](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/sports/football/nfl-protest-colin-kaepernick-activism.html).
players that pushed league executives, including Commissioner Roger
Goodell, to [more vocally support racial
justice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/sports/football/trump-anthem-kneeling-kaepernick.html).
Rivera condemned Floyd’s killing and said [he would support players’
protests](https://www.washingtonfootball.com/video/head-coach-ron-rivera-i-m-proud-of-everyone-who-is-on-the-right-side-of-the-figh).
The team launched initiatives to further “cultural understanding”
underwritten by a $250,000 donation from Snyder.

Within weeks, Snyder [removed the name of George Preston
Marshall,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/sports/football/redskins-ring-of-fame-marshall.html)
the team’s founder, from the stadium and other locations associated with
the franchise. Marshall, who chose the name “Redskins” for the team, a
term many consider a racist slur, was the last owner in the league to
sign Black players.

In July, yielding to pressure from some of the team’s biggest sponsors,
[Snyder said the team would abandon its 87-year old
name](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/sports/football/washington-redskins-new-name.html).
Just three days after news of the name change, the team’s internal
turmoil came to light when The Washington Post [published an
article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/16/redskins-sexual-harassment-larry-michael-alex-santos/?arc404=true)
that included claims from 15 women who said they were sexually harassed
while employed by the team. Snyder hired the law firm Wilkinson Walsh to
review the allegations, which include misconduct and abusive behavior by
several team executives and football personnel over more than a dozen
years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Through all the turmoil, Snyder communicated publicly through issued
statements and left Rivera to speak with the media about these and other
business decisions. Addressing reporters after The Post’s article,
Rivera said, “Dan Snyder brought me here to change culture and create an
environment of inclusion among employees. I believe everyone that works
for this franchise has a vested interest in our success.”

Meantime, Rivera’s defensive coordinator, Del Rio, raised eyebrows in
July, when he shared a [viral video of Stella
Immanuel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/technology/virus-video-trump.html),
a woman who identified herself as a doctor and made misleading claims
about the coronavirus. His support for Immanuel flew in the face of the
league’s efforts to safely reopen its training camps, test players for
the virus and educate players on how to reduce the risk of infection.

Rivera’s cultural reset got another test when running back [Derrius
Guice was arrested on domestic violence-related
charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/08/07/derrius-guice-arrested/)
in early August. Rivera said in a statement that the team’s decision to
release Guice, a second-round pick in the 2018 draft, came the same day
it learned of the charges and spoke to Guice.

While helping to select new hires, serving as the public face of the
organization, chiming in on the franchise’s branding and navigating its
new approach on race, Rivera has also had to prepare the team for the
upcoming football season.

Rivera said that the rocky start to his tenure in Washington had been
difficult, but that he had no regrets about taking the job. “This hasn’t
dampened my approach and spirit with this organization,” [he
said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/28/washingtons-ron-rivera-says-nfl-season-can-still-happen-it-will-require-discipline/).
