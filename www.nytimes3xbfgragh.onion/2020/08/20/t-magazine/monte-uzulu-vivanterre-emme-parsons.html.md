For over 20 years, the Mexican creative director Alan V. Favero has
vacationed on the Oaxacan coast. Eventually, he purchased his own land
in the fishing village of San Agustinillo so that he could build [Monte
Uzulu](https://www.monteuzulu.com/en/?campaign_id=0&emc=edit_tmag_20200818&instance_id=0&nl=the-t-list&regi_id=0&segment_id=0&te=1&user_id=be464ca5f03720b0f126373c15a15dcc).
An hour south of Puerto Escondido and perched atop a lush hill with
views of the Pacific Ocean, the minimalist resort was conceptualized by
architect Mariana Ruiz in collaboration with lighting designer Paola
Jose of the creative studio
[Sombra](https://s-ombra.com/en/field-of-light) and Favero’s interior
and industrial design firm, [Taller
Lu’um,](https://www.tallerluum.com.mx/?campaign_id=0&emc=edit_tmag_20200818&instance_id=0&nl=the-t-list&regi_id=0&segment_id=0&te=1&user_id=be464ca5f03720b0f126373c15a15dcc)
which routinely collaborates with more than 15 different artisan groups
across Mexico to preserve centuries-old techniques. Built with an eye to
maintaining the natural balance of the local ecosystem, the 11 bohemian
suites offer sun-drenched terraces and feature sustainable *macuilí*
wood furniture carved by local carpenters, straw lamps and handmade
basketwork made in Michoacán, along with cobalt cotton textiles woven in
nearby Teotitlán del Valle. After a weeklong residency at the property,
mother-son duo Karen Drijanski and Eduardo Plaschinski (of
[Niddo](https://niddo.mx/?campaign_id=0&emc=edit_tmag_20200818&instance_id=0&nl=the-t-list&regi_id=0&segment_id=0&te=1&user_id=be464ca5f03720b0f126373c15a15dcc),
Mexico City’s most revered cafe) inspired the menu at the property’s
restaurant, Temporada, which is made up of dishes that highlight the
flavors of Oaxaca’s generous bounty. *Rooms start at $128,*

A couple of years ago, the New York-based fashion designer Rosie
Assoulin got bitten by the [orange
wine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/dining/drinks/orange-wine-skin-contact.html)
bug. “I became obsessive and **** would look for it everywhere,” she
recalled. She told her husband and business partner, Max — the duo work
not only on Assoulin’s popular namesake brand but also their latest
clothing line, By Any Other Name — that they were going to make their
own orange wine one day. “He ignored me,” she added with a laugh. Skip
ahead to around this time last year, and the pair were in the Auvergne
region of France, examining the grape harvest. This week, they are
launching Vivanterre with two debut vintages: a Gamay and an orange
wine. They worked with natural winemakers Patrick Bouju and Justine
Loiseau, as well as Cedric Nicaise (the wine director of Eleven Madison
Park) to refine the taste. And they asked Omar Sosa of Apartamento
magazine to design the labels, which evoke the sun as well as the
terroir and the crunchy wax seals of older wines. For the Assoulins,
making their own organic vintages makes perfect sense in this moment.
“We want to connect with other human beings — we’re aware of meals and
family time, and what sharing a bottle of wine means to us,” said
Assoulin, who noted that Vivanterre translates to “living earth” in
French. “Almost everyone has, in some way, a *potager* (kitchen garden),
even if it’s just scallions growing in a Mason jar on a windowsill.
We’re all reckoning with nature, and it’s something we need to make
the center of our conversations.” *From $30,*

Gender inclusivity in fashion has made great strides, but footwear
always seems to be one step behind. Rarely does a shoe come in a
full-size range for all potential customers. Enter Emme Parsons, whose
Los Angeles-based, eponymous footwear line is already admirable for its
elegant craftsmanship and commitment to sustainability. Parsons recently
revisited two of her best-selling styles, the Bari and the Simone — both
names are of Italian origin (where Parsons’s production takes place) and
have historically been gender nonspecific — updating them with thicker
straps and a welted leather *fussbett* (“footbed” in German), a
19th-century innovation that replaces the shoe’s flat insole with a
form-fitting alternative. Fussbetts are quite comfortable and healthier
for feet in motion. What’s more, when Parsons learned she could produce
both the Bari and Simone in sizes up to IT46, she knew it was a perfect
opportunity to offer her well-designed staples to the men and women whom
her current shoes didn’t fit. “Our customers are drawn to styles that
are comfort-focused and easy to slip on and off but still feel refined
and elevated,” she said. As a cross-department shopper myself, it’s a
relief to know my days of longing for a testosterone-free sandal are
over.

Though now often hidden under masks, lips still need special attention —
especially in the summer, when sun and saltwater take a toll. A good
place to start is with a versatile moisturizing balm like Supergoop’s
[Play Lip
Balm](https://supergoop.com/products/fusion-lip-balm-with-acai?variant=31342124204130&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzazege6Y6wIVBI7ICh1xSwVxEAQYASABEgJdOfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds),
which has SPF 30 and comes in a clear formula ideal for layering over
lip shades. Victoria Beckham Beauty’s [Bitten Lip
Tint](https://www.victoriabeckhambeauty.com/products/bitten-lip-tint/?gallery=0&variant=bisou)
has a light but supple gel formula containing squalane and sodium
hyaluronate, which sinks in (meaning no transfer onto **** masks) for a
rosy flush. An intense hydrating **** wash of color can be found in the
San Francisco Bay Area-based brand Iris & Romeo’s [Power Peptide Lip
Balm](https://www.irisandromeo.com/products/power-peptide-lip-balm).
Rich in biomimetic peptides that stimulate collagen production, the balm
also **** gives lips a more voluminous appearance. For lips that may
already be burned or severely dried from the elements, Neova
SmartSkincare, a brand dedicated to healing and preventing photoaged
skin, developed [Cu3 Lip
Repair](https://www.neova.com/collections/eye-neck-lip/products/cu3-lip-repair-new),
to be used post-procedure or sun exposure. A thick layer worn at night
seals in moisture and will leave overexposed lips looking remarkably
better by
morning.

The Williamsburg-based fine jeweler Caitlin Mociun has built a loyal
customer base for her Bauhaus-inspired designs with Victorian touches
(think turquoise, diamonds and yellow gold for an engagement ring, and
antique glass intaglio seals for a necklace) made entirely with
ethically sourced or vintage gemstones. Not too long ago, Mociun began
creating limited-edition charms made to resemble miniature versions of
her favorite foods. Previous iterations included New York street food
(on offer were diamond doughnuts, golden hot dogs and slices of pizza)
and pool party fare (gold fried chicken and pearl-and-diamond encrusted
shucked oysters). The latest menu options in what Mociun playfully calls
her Fine Foods Collection are all crudités and finger foods: dainty
diamond-coated carrots and radishes, avocados with tiger’s-eye as the
pit (the stone fruit consists of two charms, so you can gift one half to
a friend or loved one), as well as olives made from olivine, grapes made
from grape garnet and diamond-studded pink shrimps (in rose gold,
obviously, to approximate the look of the cooked shellfish). Each charm
(only 82 were made in total) comes with a slender book of matching
cocktails designed by the photographer and mixologist Vivian Cromwell.
“I wanted the charms to be really pretty, to be a proper nod to the
food they’re referencing,” said Mociun, who added that she is always
hoping to delight **** women who are buying jewelry for themselves.
