Inquiry}\label{mark-zuckerberg-questioned-under-oath-in-ftc-antitrust-inquiry}}

It was the first known time that regulators directly interviewed a chief
executive of one of the tech companies being scrutinized for potential
antitrust violations.

WASHINGTON --- Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, answered
questions under oath on multiple days this week as part of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/technology/ftc-facebook-investigation.html}{the
Federal Trade Commission's inquiry} into whether the company broke
antitrust laws, the company said on Thursday.

The interview with Mr. Zuckerberg,
\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/20/facebook-ceo-interviewed-by-ftc-as-part-of-antitrust-probe-399492}{reported
earlier by Politico}, was the first known time that regulators directly
questioned a chief executive of one of the tech companies being
scrutinized for potential antitrust violations. Either the F.T.C. or the
Department of Justice is also
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/08/technology/antitrust-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html}{investigating
Google, Apple and Amazon}.

Interviews with major executives can be a sign that a case is moving
forward or is in an advanced stage. While the F.T.C. has already
interviewed some other senior Facebook executives under oath, others are
scheduled to be interviewed after Mr. Zuckerberg, a person with
knowledge of the matter said. The agency's interviews with Facebook
employees could stretch well into September, said the person, who would
speak only anonymously because the investigation is private.

The F.T.C. declined to comment.

Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said the company was ``committed
to cooperating with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's inquiry and
answering the questions the agency may have.''

The investigation has focused on whether Facebook bought start-ups like
Instagram and WhatsApp in order to squash young and potentially
dangerous competitors.

One round of document collection wrapped up in the spring. The trade
commission has also contacted the founders of start-ups that Facebook
bought, a sign that the agency is focusing on the company's acquisition
practices. But the investigation is expected to stretch beyond the
November presidential election.

Mr. Zuckerberg and the other chief executives --- Sundar Pichai of
Google, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Tim Cook of Apple ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html}{testified
last month before a House panel} investigating their market power. Mr.
Zuckerberg was confronted with emails showing that a Facebook executive
had referred to Instagram during the acquisition process as a
``competitive threat.'' Mr. Zuckerberg said Instagram's runaway success
was a result of its acquisition by Facebook and not preordained.

Facebook says it faces robust competition from other American tech
giants as well as foreign companies like TikTok, the viral video app
owned by the Chinese company ByteDance.
