## Mariah Carey with Ms. Lauryn Hill, ‘Save the Day’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1u3pw94">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This fall, Mariah Carey will throw the vault wide open: Not only is she
releasing her long-awaited memoir “The Meaning of Mariah Carey” on Sept.
29 (mark your calendar, Eminem\!) but she’ll also be putting out a
career-spanning rarities collection on Oct. 2, featuring a trove of
previously unreleased material. The first taste is “Save the Day,” a
Jermaine Dupri-produced track that effectively samples Ms. Lauryn Hill’s
iconic vocal from the Fugees’ 1996 cover of “Killing Me Softly.” The
song’s message of sweeping uplift certainly fits the current moment (“If
he won’t and she won’t, and they won’t, then we won’t, we won’t ever
learn to save the day”) but the thumping beat and breathy vocals are a
throwback to mid-90s Mariah. LINDSAY ZOLADZ

## Phoenix, ‘Identical’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Sofia Coppola’s movies are known for their well-curated needle drops:
[Bow Wow Wow in
Versailles\!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZByH4Wai_I)[The Jesus and
Mary Chain in Tokyo\!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPly3e12ca8) One
boon of being married to the Phoenix frontman Thomas Mars, though, is
that it’s probably pretty easy to commission an ’80s-inspired pop song
custom-made for the mood of your latest film. “Identical,” from the
soundtrack of Coppola’s forthcoming father-daughter movie “On the Rocks”
(starring Bill Murray and Rashida Jones) has a sleek surface and an
appealing undercurrent of nostalgia, driven by sunset-hued synths and
Mars’ sweet falsetto. You can almost picture the montage. ZOLADZ

## Chloe Moriondo, ‘I Want to Be With You’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Acutely observed bedroom pop about losing yourself on the path to
someone else, served with a side of arena-emo triumph. JON CARAMANICA

## BTS, ‘Dynamite’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

BTS’s first single wholly in English is a sprightly bit of lite
disco-funk somewhere in between Jamiroquai and Charlie Puth. Less
musically adventurous than the songs that made the group a worldwide
phenomenon, it relies on brightness, exuberance and relentless good
cheer. Sadly, though, “Dynamite” includes no real rapping — always one
of the group’s strong points, and a weapon that makes it among the most
versatile of pop outfits. CARAMANICA

## Nubya Garcia, ‘Stand With Each Other’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The decorated young [British tenor saxophonist Nubya
Garcia](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/arts/music/nubya-garcia-source.html)
recorded her new album, “Source,” with thoughts swirling about her own
identity and family history. Of course, that’s all inseparable from the
work of communal engagement. Speaking to DownBeat, she wondered: “What’s
the source of humanity’s power when the world’s falling apart?” Of the
album’s nine tracks — recorded at sessions in both Colombia and the U.K.
— perhaps none addresses that question more directly than “Stand With
Each Other,” a lapping, mesmeric tune with inflections of reggae and
cumbia. Musing and even-toned, doused in reverb, Ms. Garcia’s saxophone
does a patient dance with the harmonizing voices of three women and a
loose clatter of percussion. There’s no big climax to speak of; what you
hear is the sound of musicians in deep communication, listening and
feeling as they go. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

## Bebel Gilberto featuring Mart’nália, ‘Na Cara’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Bebel Gilberto’s new album, “Agora” (“Now”), produced by Thomas
Bartlett, captures the untranslatable Brazilian mood of saudade — a
knowing, nostalgia-tinged melancholy — by placing her whispery voice
within a subtle electronic mix of instruments, loops and what sound like
blurred old samples. Gilberto shares “Na Cara” (“To My Face”), a demand
for truthfulness, with the raspy samba singer Mart’nália; around its
slinky bass line are fleeting glimmers of vibraphone, piano and string
orchestra, appearing and vanishing like fading memories. JON PARELES

## Tomberlin, ‘Wasted’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“At Weddings,” the 2018 debut album from the indie-folk artist Sarah
Beth Tomberlin, evoked reflective solitude. On “Wasted,” the first
single from her upcoming EP “Projections,” she’s let a few well-known
collaborators into the mix and captured an even more complex mood.
Coproduction from the D.I.Y. maestro Alex G layers Tomberlin’s guitar
atop a skittering, off-kilter beat that sounds like a children’s
clapping game. And the music video, directed by the actress Busy
Phillips and starring one of her daughters, is poignant and compelling:
Two children idly explore their neighborhood while Tomberlin, in a
striking neon green dress, haunts the background of the frame like a
ghost of her own carefree past. ZOLADZ

## Hardy, ‘Boyfriend’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The rising country star Hardy takes a detour toward nice-guy balladry
with “Boyfriend,” a sharply written song about taking things to the next
level. “I’m so sick of driving clear across town every night from my
place to yours/I don’t wanna be your boyfriend anymore”: This is how
sensitive country bros put a ring on it. CARAMANICA

## Angel Olsen, ‘Waving, Smiling’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Waving, Smiling” couldn’t be more sparse. It’s just guitar and voice,
Angel Olsen picking slow, tentative arpeggios like the skeleton of a
soul ballad as she sing about the aftermath of a heartbreak. She moves
gradually from accusation to sorrow to acceptance. “I’ve laid out all
those tears/I’ve made my bed, made up of all my fears,” she sings,
letting her voice tremble and then rise toward a tentative peace.
PARELES

## Father John Misty, ‘To S.’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Father John Misty’s music wriggles in and out of scare quotes, but “To
S.,” one of two new songs he released this week, spends most of its run
time unfurling gently outside of them. Yes, there are a few wry
Misty-isms here (“Guess what? I love you/Someone’s gotta clean up the
mess”) but mostly the song finds Josh Tillman reveling in piano-driven
Laurel Canyon melancholy. “What about life on the ground makes you feel
so strange?” he croons, as backing strings render the song appropriately
weightless. ZOLADZ

## Alex the Astronaut, ‘I Like to Dance’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Alex the Astronaut — the Australian songwriter Alex Lynn — sums up a
trapped, longtime abusive relationship in her character study “I Like to
Dance,” from her debut album, “The Theory of Absolutely Nothing.” A
guitar strumming four chords, a piano and a violin accompany the
first-person narration: “He didn’t want to be like this/I just wish he’d
stop,” she sings, as the harrowing details, the children and financial
dependency, build up: “I just wish he’d stop hitting me.” PARELES

## Jazz Is Dead featuring Marcos Valle, ‘Queira Bem’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-cfo9c3">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The producers and musical polymaths Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed
Muhammad have been treating their new collaborative project, Jazz Is
Dead, as a chance to go past crate-digging, connecting directly with
some of their biggest influences from elder generations. In June they
released an album in collaboration with one of the most copiously
sampled figures in music, the vibraphonist and vocalist Roy Ayers. Now
they’re already back with another full-length, this time joined by the
76-year-old Brazilian musician Marcos Valle, whose
[stamp](https://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/rockin-eternally-leon-ware-marcos-valle-story/)
has also landed on countless hip-hop records through the art of
appropriation. On “Queira Bem,” Valle’s wispy, vulnerable vocals drift
over a placid backing of electric piano, analog synth, flutes, crinkly
guitar and a stubbornly coolheaded beat carried by the bass and drums.
RUSSONELLO

## Moor Mother and Billy Woods, ‘Furies’

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1jwe9i6" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The beat, a loop of hand drums, a distant choir and a flute line, is
resolute and unhurried. The lyrics, from a pitch-shifting Moor Mother
and a calm, deliberate Billy Woods, are splintered but combative: “They
don’t want me to shine ’cause I remind them of the fight,” Moor Mother
intones. PARELES
