Hello! And welcome to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/five-weeknight-dishes}{Five
Weeknight Dishes}. I've always been the kind of person who likes to cook
when things feel out of control. My mom died when I was quite young, and
the kitchen was her place, so when she died, it became \emph{my} place,
where I escaped to --- and still do, to find comfort in making a recipe
that will work if I just follow the instructions. How life-affirming,
right?

These crazy days, I find myself gravitating toward comforting dishes,
not necessarily of the mac and cheese sort (which I love, but ate my
weight in back in March), but noodles and chicken and stews that have an
air of familiarity with a touch of the unexpected. The dishes below are
like that, I think. I hope that you like them and that you'll cook them.

You can reach me at
\href{mailto:margaux@NYTimes.com}{\nolinkurl{margaux@NYTimes.com}} with
questions, complaints and compliments. Have a wonderful week.

Here are five dishes for the week.

With Charred Scallions, Green Beans and Chile Oil}}

This beautiful tangle of noodles from Hetty McKinnon is a huge
improvement on the vending machine ramen I lived on in my 20s. It comes
together in about 30 minutes, and, if you use store-bought chile oil,
it'll be on the table even faster. Use fresh ramen or the rectangular
dried packages hiding in your cabinet (but ditch the spice packet). I'm
eager to try this with asparagus in place of the green beans.

Chicken With Artichokes and Mushrooms}}

When Peg Bracken shopped around her manuscript for
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Hate-Cook-Book-50th-Anniversary/dp/0446545929}{``The
I Hate to Cook Book''} in the late 1950s, six male publishers rejected
it. They said it would never sell because ``women regard cooking as
sacred.'' (I rolled my eyes when I read that, too.) It took a female
editor to appreciate Ms. Bracken's witty instructions --- ``Let it cook
five minutes while you light a cigarette and stare sullenly at the
sink'' --- and her easy-to-follow recipes. This simple recipe, which is
adapted from Ms. Bracken and uses canned artichokes, comes together in a
snap. You could do this with boneless breasts or thighs, too, but reduce
your cook time accordingly.

Caviar}}

Somewhere between a dip and a bean salad is cowboy caviar, or Texas
caviar, as it's called in some parts. This dish was created by Helen
Corbitt, a dietitian from New York who moved to Texas in the 1930s to
work in the restaurant industry. There are as many variations as there
are stars in the sky, and I've never had one that I didn't like. Once
upon a time, when my kids went to school, I packed this in their
lunchboxes with tortilla chips. You can also serve it alongside grilled
chicken or stirred into cooled, cooked pasta for a quick and easy pasta
salad.

e Ceci (Italian Pasta and Chickpea Stew)}}

This version of the classic Roman stew was developed by Colu Henry. It's
a big reader favorite, and for good reason: It's vegetarian, it's
adaptable and you can throw it together in about a half-hour. Make it
with any small, shaped pasta, but I like the way the chickpeas nestle
into the dimples of orecchiette.

\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020308-coconut-gochujang-glazed-chicken-with-broccoli}{\textbf{Coconut-Gochujang
Glazed Chicken Breasts With Broccoli}}

I pretty much love anything made with coconut milk, and this vibrant,
saucy 15-minute (!) dish from Kay Chun is no exception. Simmering
boneless chicken breasts in the coconut milk helps keep them tender, and
the gochujang and ginger cuts through the richness. Serve it over rice
and with blanched broccoli, as suggested, or with a crunchy cold salad
of romaine lettuce and chunks of cucumber.
