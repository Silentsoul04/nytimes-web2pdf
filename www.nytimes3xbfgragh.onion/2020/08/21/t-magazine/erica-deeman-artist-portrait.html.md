*In each installment of The Artists, T highlights a recent or
little-shown work by a Black artist, along with a few words from that
artist putting the work into context. This week, we’re looking at a
piece by Erica Deeman, who focuses on portrait photography, exploring
questions of race and identity. Her new show, “Familiar Stranger,” opens
next week at* [*Anthony Meier Fine
Arts.*](http://www.anthonymeierfinearts.com/exhibitions)

**Name:** Erica Deeman

**Age:** 43

**Based in:** San Francisco, Calif.

**Originally from:** Nottingham, England

**When and where did you make this work?** I made this photograph with
Jonathan in my living room in San Francisco in 2016.

**Can you describe what is going on in the work?** Jonathan — a friend
of my roommate at the time — was visiting the United States from London.
I’d been working on my “[Brown](http://www.ericadeeman.com/new-gallery)”
portraiture series for a while, which focuses on men from the African
diaspora and is centered on what it means to see and be seen as a Black
**** man in the United States and beyond. I asked if he would consider
sitting for me, and thankfully he agreed. I set up the background and
lights in my living room, and we began the collaboration. For me, coming
to the U.S. has had a profound impact on my sense of self and belonging.
The topics of race, gender **** and representation drove our
conversation — sharing the familiarity of our homeland experiences,
moments of joy, frustration and reflection. I wondered how he felt in
the limited time he had spent here. This image was made in a moment of
pause and deep thought.

**What inspired you to make this work?** So many thoughts and ideas were
pulsing through my mind at the time. First, a tenderness in seeing Black
**** men, set against the historical archive of portraiture and
scientific photography. Seeing the beauty in Blackness, I am constantly
reminded of [Carrie Mae
Weems](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/t-magazine/carrie-mae-weems-moma-garden.html)’s
piece, **** [“I Looked and Looked and Failed to See What so Terrified
You”](https://artmuseum.mtholyoke.edu/object/i-looked-and-looked-and-failed-see-what-so-terrified-you-louisiana-project-series)
(2003). ** There was also a significant community-building aspect in
making the photographs. I was still finding my feet, so to speak, so
making this work allowed me to fold into the Black community in the Bay
Area, feeling a deeper connection to my new home.

**What’s the work of art in any medium that changed your life?** I
admire artists who can use any medium to share their ideas. For me,
[Howardena
Pindell](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/t-magazine/howardena-pindell.html)
is one of those artists who has the mastery of transforming her
audience. Of her pieces, I choose the video work [“Free, White,
and 21”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5tJNXiB9Ko) (1980). I first
saw it at the Pérez **** Art Museum Miami a few days after Art Basel one
year. The museum was very quiet, and I had the opportunity to spend
uninterrupted time with it.
