Mika Salamanca’s mug shot is a departure from most of the images you’ll
find of her online, particularly the ones she posts on Instagram to her
1 million-plus followers — winsome selfies and playful portraits with
her head cocked to the side. But in the photograph released by the
Honolulu Police Department, Ms. Salamanca, a social media influencer
from the Philippines, stares directly into the camera, her expression
inscrutable.

Ms. Salamanca [was arrested in Honolulu, Hawaii on
July 24](https://www.kitv.com/story/42406880/social-media-influencer-apologizes-for-breaking-hawaiis-mandated-14day-quarantine)
for having broken the state’s [mandatory 14-day
quarantine](https://hidot.hawaii.gov/coronavirus/). She was apprehended
after posting images and videos out with friends within days of her
arrival, leading a group of locals to report her to authorities.

“One day it will all make sense,” reads an [Instagram
post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDbn_vinVjS/) from Aug. 4, which
racked up more than 33,000 likes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Whether it makes sense or not, Ms. Salamanca’s transgressions,
subsequent arrest and [public
apology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DA9436drzo) is one of the more
titillating, and public, examples of quarantine enforcement in the
United States. But as quarantine requirements for travelers have become
[increasingly common throughout the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/travel/state-travel-restrictions.html),
in states including New York, Vermont and Kentucky, plus the city of
Chicago, the prevailing theme is the difficulty of effective
enforcement.

Roughly six months into the coronavirus pandemic, local and state
governments have struggled to contain the spread of the coronavirus with
limited manpower and dwindling resources, and following quarantine rules
is more [often than not left to the traveler’s
discretion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/nyregion/coronavirus-quarantine-nyc.html).
Officials hope that threats of fines or imprisonment and, more
crucially, an honor code state of mind, will prove effective. But as
issues of right and wrong become increasingly muddied in our
ever-shifting pandemic world, can travelers be counted on to do the
right thing?

Hawaii’s quarantine order for trans-Pacific travelers went into effect
on March 26, and currently applies to everyone who enters the state
(Gov. David Ige further instituted a partial quarantine requirement [for
inter-island
travel](https://www.khon2.com/coronavirus/reminder-partial-interisland-travel-quarantine-goes-into-effect-aug-11/),
beginning Aug. 11). Those caught breaking quarantine can be fined up to
$5,000, or imprisoned for up to one year.

In contrast, most other states’ quarantine orders are only required for
travelers coming from places experiencing high infection rates. [In New
York](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory), that
currently includes more than 30 states, plus Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands, according to a list that is updated weekly. Those who
violate the quarantine order are subject to fines up to $10,000.
Connecticut [has started issuing $1,000
fines](https://ctmirror.org/2020/08/12/lamont-administration-fines-5-more-ct-residents-for-violating-covid-travel-rules/)
to visitors who fail to submit a travel advisory form to its public
health department or violate quarantine orders. Other states, including
[Ohio](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/families-and-individuals/COVID-19-Travel-Advisory/COVID-19-Travel-Advisory)
and [New
Hampshire](https://www.covidguidance.nh.gov/out-state-visitors), frame
quarantine requirements as recommendations or requests without the
threat of fines.

Hawaii’s geographic remoteness, and the fact that it is, well, a group
of islands, puts it at an advantage when it comes to monitoring who is
coming or going. All travelers are required to fill out a form provided
by the state’s transportation department upon arrival, and quarantine
enforcement is handled by individual counties. As of Aug. 11, the state
reported 27 arrests on Oahu, 22 in Maui County, 29 on the Big Island and
60 on Kauai according to Krishna Jayaram, special assistant to the state
attorney general.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“This program, like everything with Covid, is something of a learning
process,” said Mr. Jayaram. “If we’ve become aware of someone who may be
violating the order, we conduct a pretty thorough investigation.”

Many investigations are spurred by concerned citizens, some of whom are
banding together on social media to root out quarantine violators.
[Hawai’i Quarantine Kapu
Breakers](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/groups/KapuBreakers), who
alerted the authorities to Ms. Salamanca’s transgressions, write that
their purpose is, “to bring awareness to issues surrounding tourists and
locals not adhering to public safety standards during the pandemic.”
(Ms. Salamanca did not respond to requests for comment.) [Incidents of
community
policing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/31/arrest-breaking-quarantine-covid-florida/)
have also been reported in Florida, South Carolina and Kentucky, plus
examples of [particularly vigilant
enforcement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/travel/Canada-border-crossings-coronavirus.html)
against Americans attempting to sneak into Canada.

Quarantine violations seem particularly egregious in Hawaii, where,
comparatively, the rules are unambiguous. Brad Johnson, who lives in
Maui, traveled to Kentucky in early June to be with his ailing father.
Mr. Johnson noted that, upon returning to Hawaii weeks later, it was
virtually impossible to exit the airport without filling out a form and
interacting with government officials, including the Hawaii National
Guard. He was required to provide his phone number and told to turn on
his location services. Still, he noticed that a number of people who had
been on his flight were pushing back both in transit and upon arrival.

“There were maybe a dozen people who were not wearing masks, and kind of
creating a ruckus,” he said. “I saw one of these women arguing with
officials, and refusing to turn on her phone’s tracking. She was
visiting family; it was her right, they were violating it. The officials
made clear that her other option was to get back on the plane and go
back.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Mr. Johnson was contacted twice by government officials to make sure
that he was abiding by the rules. Other states, in contrast, are making
enforcement a much lower priority. Furthermore, the rules of what is and
isn’t allowed are less clear.

New York also requires visitors from its changing list of hot-spot
states to fill out a form sharing their location and contact
information. But the threat of enforcement remains lower than that of
Hawaii, not least because of the sheer number of visitors and the
disparate entry points. Since the first quarantine order was issued on
June 25, the state’s health department has worked in partnership with
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to ensure that health
officials are stationed at airports and positioned by flights arriving
from applicable states to hand out and collect forms (those who refuse
are subject to a $2,000 fine).

On Aug. 5, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to set up checkpoints on
metro-area bridges and tunnels, plus similar setups at Penn Station and
the Port Authority Bus Terminal. But details of the plan [were scarce,
and somewhat
confusing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-quarantine-checkpoints.html).
According to Amanda Kwan, a senior public information officer at the
Port Authority, “The Port Authority has been in contact with the city,
and their effort will have no operational impact to any of our
facilities. All vehicle checkpoints are being set up off of Port
Authority property without Port Authority personnel.” [As of
Aug. 14](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/most-of-nycs-coronavirus-checkpoints-stops-have-taken-place-in-one-borough/2567143/),
the majority of stops made were on Staten Island, while only 36 vehicles
entering Manhattan were stopped.

Bethany Mitchell returned home to New York on July 14 from San
Francisco, having left the city in March to stay with her boyfriend when
her work as a performer with the [Battery
Dance](https://batterydance.org/) company dried up. She wanted to try
her best to follow the quarantine rules, but found some of the asks
unclear, or unfeasible.

“I hadn’t been in my apartment for four months. I had to go to the
grocery store and pharmacy; to do things to function,” she said. She
looked into delivery options for her groceries, but found that it was
prohibitively expensive. She also got tested shortly after arriving;
when she got her results a week later, she began seeing friends from a
distance in parks. “My mind-set was, ‘At least I didn’t bring it from
California\!’”

According to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office, a negative coronavirus test
is not a pass from quarantine, but this information can be hard to find
(it’s on page six of [an online
F.A.Q.](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/07/nys-covid-travel-advisory-faq_0.pdf)).
And for a number of states, including Vermont and Alaska, a negative
test can be a quarantine pass. In lieu of clear guidelines and regular
check-ins, Ms. Mitchell said that she made choices that felt safe,
financially viable and rational to her (she was contacted by the state
health department once, on day 13 of her quarantine period). The
governor’s office could not share numbers of those caught violating
quarantine in New York.

The desire to do what’s right is common, but defining that is difficult
as people receive mixed messages. [Dr. Erez
Yoeli](http://erezyoeli.com/), a research scientist at M.I.T.’s Sloan
School of Management and director of the Applied Cooperation Team, said
that the lack of consistency in the rules on the national, state and
even city level leads to ambiguity, which leaves room for plausible
deniability.

“That makes it hard to make these rules social norms,” he said. “Without
those social norms, there’s no way that society can enforce the rules
informally.”

Still, “soft” enforcement remains central to many of these quarantine
plans. Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of Chicago’s public health
department, said at [a
recent](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ChicagoMayorsOffice/videos/292903845473289)
[news
conference](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ChicagoMayorsOffice/videos/292903845473289),
“Our primary objective is about educating and informing the public.”
Chicago is currently requiring a two-week quarantine from 19 states and
Puerto Rico. Dr. Arwady noted that, while the city does have the ability
to issue fines of $100 to $500 per day, enforcement is not her main
goal. “I have absolutely no intention of pulling cars over that have
out-of-state license plates, \[or\] developing watch lists of people
flying through the airports.”

This leaves some businesses in a challenging position. Hotels, for
instance, can receive guest reservations from a variety of sources —
online platforms like Expedia, travel agents, direct booking on their
websites — that provide varying degrees of data and information about
where a guest is coming from and if they would be required to
quarantine.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“When it comes from our website, we can get more information from
people,” said Robert Baum, a partner at [Bedderman
Lodging](https://staybedderman.com/), a hotel group based in Chicago.
“But even then we have a better shot of knowing where they live,
rather than where they were most recently.”

Mr. Baum said he has reached out to the city for advice on how to deal
with guests. In the meantime, Bedderman is emailing all guests coming to
its three hotels to inform them of the city’s rules, and further
reminding them during the check-in process. Again, the hotels aren’t
necessarily able to track whether or not guests are coming from hot spot
states; they aren’t checking passports or parsing credit card
statements.

“Unlike other retail businesses, it’s pretty much a guarantee that
people are coming in from other places,” Mr. Baum said. “It puts our
staff in a challenging position. When there’s no real way for us to
police these quarantine rules, it’s hard for us to reassure them.”

Chicago city officials did not share numbers of those who had been
caught violating quarantine orders.

The patchwork of quarantine rules, not dissimilar from differing norms
regarding mask usage and social distancing, seeds confusion. As Dr.
Yoeli said, “confusion introduces this ability to act in your own
self-interest.” But he still thinks it’s worth trying to establish more
effective social norms.

“Everyone wants guidance; everyone wants to be OK,” he said. “I think
that everyone would find it something of a relief to have a clearer idea
of what to do.”
