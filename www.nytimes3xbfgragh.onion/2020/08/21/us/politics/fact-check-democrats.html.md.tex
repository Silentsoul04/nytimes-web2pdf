\section{Fact-Checking the Democratic National
Convention}\label{fact-checking-the-democratic-national-convention}}

The four-day virtual event focused on character rather than policy.
Still, Democrats exaggerated about Social Security, jobs and the
coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON --- This week's virtual Democratic National Convention was
largely devoted to character, with testimonials to the decency and
empathy of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and criticisms of President Trump's
temperament.

Few words were spent on policy discussions or fact-based claims.

When they did cite statistics, many speakers spoke grimly about the
scale of the coronavirus epidemic and its human and economic toll ---
numbers that needed no exaggeration. The substance of the remarks
coupled with the scripted, vetted and, in some cases, prerecorded nature
of the convention left little to fact check.

But at times, the Democrats veered from what facts they tried to marshal
while castigating Mr. Trump and extolling Mr. Biden.

\subsection{Biden and others omitted context when warning about Social
Security.}\label{biden-and-others-omitted-context-when-warning-about-social-security}}

What Was Said

\emph{``He's proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half of
Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue,
resulting in cuts.''}\\
--- Mr. Biden on Thursday

\emph{``Trump concocted fraudulent executive orders that do virtually
nothing to address the crisis, while threatening the very future of
Social Security and Medicare.''}\\
--- Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Monday

\textbf{This is exaggerated.} Earlier this month, **** Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/}{temporarily
deferred payroll taxes}, which fund Social Security, for the rest of the
year to give economic relief to workers making under \$100,000 annually.
But he and his aides have issued conflicting and imprecise statements
about what his actual proposal is for the future of the tax.

On several occasions, Mr. Trump has said that he will
``\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-080920/}{make
permanent cuts to the payroll tax}'' or will
``\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-10-2020/}{be
terminating that tax}'' if he wins re-election. Aides, however,
\href{http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2008/09/sotu.01.html}{have
said} that he was referring to
``\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-8-13-2020/}{permanent
forgiveness}'' of the four-months' worth of taxes, rather than
eliminating payroll taxes altogether.

Asked about the impact that such actions would have on the Social
Security Trust Fund, Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-air-force-one-departure-morristown-nj-081020/}{said
last week} that the revenue would be reimbursed through the government's
general fund.

Such an idea is plausible if Mr. Trump was referring to permanent
forgiveness of taxes for four months, but it would need approval from
Congress. The general fund has been used to reimburse the Social
Security Trust Fund
\href{https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33028.pdf\#page=15}{\$102.7 billion
and \$114.3 billion} during the payroll tax holiday in 2011 and 2012,
while the lost revenue from a four-month holiday is estimated to be
about
\href{https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-would-president-trumps-executive-orders-cost}{\$100
billion.}

Exaggerating threats to Social Security is a tried and true Democratic
campaign theme. But it would be highly destabilizing to Social Security
if Mr. Trump did try to eliminate payroll taxes altogether. Payroll
taxes \href{https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data\#7}{generated
\$1.2 trillion in revenue last year}, or about a third of all federal
revenue. Over a 10-year period, eliminating the taxes would lead to a
loss of \$16 trillion.

What Was SAID

\emph{``Social Security beneficiaries count on the post office to get
their checks.''}\\
--- The actress Eva Longoria on Monday

\textbf{This is exaggerated.} Most Social Security beneficiaries do not
receive their checks through the mail. In August, 549,818 people
received their checks through the mail, while more than 63 million
people --- or \href{https://www.ssa.gov/deposit/T2StateSum_a.htm}{about
99.1 percent} --- received their benefits through direct deposits.

\subsection{Democrats gave outsized credit to the Obama-Biden
administration for saving the auto
industry.}\label{democrats-gave-outsized-credit-to-the-obama-biden-administration-for-saving-the-auto-industry}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/21/us/politics/21demfactcheck2/21demfactcheck2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

What Was SAID

\emph{``Autoworkers in this union and across our state could have lost
their jobs if not for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.''}\\
--- Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan on Monday

\emph{``They saved the automobile industry and a whole lot of good union
jobs with it.''}\\
--- former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis on Wednesday

\textbf{This is exaggerated.} The Obama administration certainly played
a role in rescuing Detroit automakers during the financial recession,
but its actions were not the sole reason carmakers survived and
recovered.

In a
\href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2109502}{paper}
examining government intervention in the auto sector, economists at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Miami University of Ohio also
pointed to former President George W. Bush's executive order permitting
the Treasury Department to use funds from the Troubled Asset Relief
Program to assist carmakers.

At the time, President-elect Obama praised Mr. Bush's efforts as
``\href{https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/an-inconvenient-truth-it-was-george-w-bush-who-bailed-out-the-automakers}{necessary
to avoid a collapse.''}

Steven Rattner, who led Mr. Obama's auto task force, later
\href{https://www.google.com/books/edition/Overhaul/zaXm0yubX9IC?hl=en\&gbpv=1\&bsq=Bush}{wrote
in his book} that ``the loans bought time, not just until January 20,
Inauguration Day, but until at least March 31, giving us a little
breathing room.'' He commended Mr. Bush's team for laying the structural
groundwork for the rescue plan.

What Was SAID

\emph{``In fact, while Biden helped save one million auto industry jobs,
Trump has lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs.''}\\
--- former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York on Thursday

\textbf{This is misleading.} Mr. Bloomberg is comparing apples to
oranges, crediting Mr. Biden by using a projection while docking Mr.
Trump with material data.

A
\href{https://www.cargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Effect-on-the-US-Economy-of-the-Succesful-Restructuring-of-General-Motors.pdf}{study}
from the Center for Automotive Research estimated that the government
auto bailout prevented the loss of between 1.2 million and 2.6 million
jobs in 2009. Nonetheless, the
\href{https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3133600101?data_tool=XGtable}{auto}
\href{https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES4244100001?data_tool=XGtable}{sector}
still lost over 112,000 jobs that year, before bouncing back during the
Obama administration.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics does show that the
manufacturing sector has lost 257,000 jobs since January 2017. The
number of manufacturing jobs had been steadily increasing for a decade
before the coronavirus pandemic, when the economy at large began
shedding jobs.

But a similar study showed that the Paycheck Protection Program, which
provided loans to small businesses, also
\href{http://economics.mit.edu/files/20094}{helped save 2.3 million
jobs} through the first week of June. David Autor, an economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the report,
said that follow-up research will examine employment impact by sector,
but ``it's likely that P.P.P. prevented some manufacturing jobs from
being eliminated, at least temporarily.''

Gov. Andrew Cuomo discussed the coronavirus pandemic at the virtual
convention.Credit...Democratic National Convention

What Was SAID

\emph{``The European virus infected the Northeast while the White House
was still fixated on China. The virus had been attacking us for months
before they even knew it was here. We saw the failure of a government
that tried to deny the virus, then tried to ignore it, and then tried to
politicize it.''}\\
\emph{--- Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York on Monday}

\textbf{This is exaggerated.} Mr. Cuomo was likely referring to
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6928a5.htm?s_cid=mm6928a5_w}{a
study} from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the
limited impact of Mr. Trump's travel restrictions on the virus in New
York City.

The C.D.C. noted that Mr. Trump had limited travel from China on Feb. 2
and from Europe on March 13, but the coronavirus was already widespread
in New York by March 15, largely from Europe: ``Importation and
community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 had already occurred in NYC.''

The New York Times has reported on the federal government's many
failures in handling the pandemic, but Mr. Cuomo is shirking some
responsibility for the severity of New York's outbreak. For example, the
state was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/nyregion/new-york-coronavirus-response-delays.html}{late
to adopt social distancing measures}.

Nursing home workers and residents' families have also pointed to the
Cuomo
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/nyregion/nursing-homes-deaths-coronavirus.html}{administration's
directive} effectively ordering nursing homes to accept residents who
had been discharged from the hospital if they were deemed ``medically
stable.'' A report by the State Department of Health, however, asserted
that the directive did not cause the virus's spread in nursing homes.
