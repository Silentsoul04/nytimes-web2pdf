People with respiratory illnesses may be more vulnerable right now.
Also: Are N95 masks recommended for wildfires?

\textbf{So far this year, California has been hit hard by wildfires,
record high temperatures and power blackouts, all in the midst of a
pandemic. One reader asked how residents with respiratory illnesses are
faring.}

Evan Underwood, who suffers from asthma, migraines and heat sensitivity,
has been quarantined inside his home in San Ramon for months. And now,
with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/wildfires-live-updates.html}{wildfires
raging through several Western states}, if the
\href{https://gispub.epa.gov/airnow/}{air quality index} --- which
measures pollution levels --- goes above 100, going outside for even a
few minutes would trigger an asthma attack and migraine that would last
an entire day. His plan is to hunker down at home until fire season is
over, as long as he doesn't lose power or is forced to evacuate.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/us/coronavirus-california-life.html}{For
our series answering readers' questions about life during the pandemic},
Mr. Underwood asked us about how
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/climate/california-smoke-wildfires.html}{smoke
inhalation} is affecting people who are high risk for severe Covid-19,
like himself, and if they are more vulnerable to significant illness.
``If our whole region is bathed in smoke, when so many people still have
damaged lungs, the virus is still endemic and people are going back to
work, that can't be good, can it?'' he wrote.

As
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/us/california-wildfires-vacaville.html}{my
colleagues have reported}, Covid-19 and smoke is a dangerous
combination, as both affect the respiratory system, making those exposed
to the virus more vulnerable.

Polluted air can also weaken the immune systems of healthy people,
making them more susceptible to illnesses like Covid-19, according to
experts from the
\href{https://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/AirQuality/SmokeFromFires}{Washington
State Department of Health}.

And
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/climate/air-pollution-coronavirus-covid.html}{studies
have shown} that in areas with poor air quality, people are more likely
to die if they contract the virus.

``We know that people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease are at higher risk for both acquiring Covid-19 and having more
severe symptoms if they do become infected,'' said Dr. Jeanne A. Noble,
an emergency medicine doctor and the director of the Covid-19 response
at U.C.S.F. Medical Center's emergency department. ``Adding smoke
inhalation into the mix will further increase the vulnerability of
everyone to Covid-19, but particularly for those with respiratory
problems.''

Dr. Noble said she could see smoke rising above the city as she drove
over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to work on Aug. 19. Since
March, the emergency department at U.C.S.F. Hospital has been using
outdoor tents to properly space patients as they wait to be seen. The
fumes will probably make them unusable.

``We've been strongly encouraging everyone to take things outdoors. It's
just so much safer. And now we can't,'' she said. ``It's essentially
like winter coming early.''

In addition, Dr. Noble said her department would most likely be busier,
as there is always an uptick in respiratory cases during power outages
from people who rely on electrically powered CPAP machines for breathing
or nebulizers for administering medicine. Heat is also a trigger for
asthma and emphysema, she said.

For people who have been infected with Covid-19 and have lingering
effects, Dr. Michael Daignault, an emergency room doctor at Providence
Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, said that since Covid-19 is a
multi-systemic inflammatory disease, significant smoke exposure and
inhalation, along with an underlying respiratory system disease, could
possibly exacerbate symptoms.

``I think this depends on the primary symptoms a patient with Covid-19
had and their underlying medical problems,'' he said.

In previous years, people have used N95 masks or respirators to protect
themselves against inhaling dangerous particles caused by wildfire
smoke.

But Allison Thomas, a reader in Butte County, asked us: ``There are no
N95 masks available for the general public to use. What are we going to
use when the wildfires begin?''

Like everything these days, the pandemic has complicated things. Both
the
\href{https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-surgical-masks-and-face-masks\#s1}{Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention} and state public health officials
are telling people to save N95 masks for workers on the frontline of the
pandemic.

\href{https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/}{The California Department
of Public Health states on their website}: **``**Don't buy N95
respirator masks for personal use. They are part of PPE needed by
medical professionals.''

Dr. Noble cautions against the use of N95 masks with exhalation valves.
Although they are effective in filtering out particles from smoke, the
valves let the wearer's breath escape the mask, thus posing a risk for
spreading Covid-19. If the mask contains an exhalation valve, she said
you should wear a surgical mask over it.

If you are feeling the effects of smoke, you should try other means of
exposure reduction first.

In its \href{https://www3.epa.gov/airnow/wildfire_may2016.pdf}{guide for
wildfire smoke}, the Environmental Protection Agency advised,
``Respirators should only be used after first implementing other, more
effective methods of exposure reduction, including staying indoors,
reducing activity, and using HEPA air cleaners indoors to reduce overall
smoke exposure.''

to know about buying an air purifier to clear wildfire
smoke.}}\emph{{]}}

If you cannot reduce your exposure in other ways,
\href{https://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/AirQuality/SmokeFromFires\#q7}{experts
say} N95 or N100 masks will work to filter out fine particles. But keep
in mind that respirators are not approved for infants and small children
and may not work on people with beards.

For people with respiratory illnesses, Dr. Daignault said to make sure
you have enough medicine in stock and use breathing aids, like
albuterol, when needed and seek medical attention if things worsen.

Dr. Noble said, ``I think people are going to have to be really vigilant
about watching the air quality.'' She recommends checking
\href{https://gispub.epa.gov/airnow/}{the E.P.A.'s interactive map for
updates}. ``Just as a lot of people have gotten in the habit of tracking
Covid-19 numbers to see when their kid's school might reopen or when
their county gets off the watch list, I think people now need to get in
the habit of checking the air quality index.''
