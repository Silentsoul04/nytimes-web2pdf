Plans to ensure safe classes vary by province and school board or are

Among Canadian educators, public health officials and parents who
learned during lockdown that they aren’t substitute teachers, there is a
consensus that students should return. But all of the provinces are
proposing varying approaches to ensure safety. Furthermore, within most
provinces, many school boards have their own ideas. And the plans in
many places are still works-in-progress, leaving parents unsure of what
to expect.

For a peek at what lies ahead, I spoke with education researchers this
week. Their broad conclusion: balancing education and infection controls
is likely to require constant adjustments.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s a fantasy to think this is going to go smoothly,” said [Joel
Westheimer,](https://research.uottawa.ca/people/westheimer-joel) a
professor of education at the University of Ottawa. “All in all, I think
that there are compelling reasons for kids to go back. But it needs to
be done in the right way.”

Jason Ellis, a professor of education at the University of British
Columbia, said everyone in education has been focused on the return
since March. The ever shifting and incomplete plans, he said, are the
result of a lack of ideal options.

“You can’t space out the kids dramatically in schools because you would
need to hire thousands of teachers, and they don’t exist,” Professor
Ellis said. “You also would need much different school buildings than
you have. So they’re betting on low community transmission. If it
remains low, as it is in most parts of Canada, then there shouldn’t be
too many cases in the schools. We’ll see.”

Professor Westheimer said parents should brace themselves for a cycle of
closings and reopenings until class size reduction becomes possible. And
among the provinces, he said Ontario’s preparation is one of the most
wanting.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Ontario has been a standout in providing almost no resources to get
this done,” he
said.

Both professors agree that teachers face a significant challenge.

“It’s an enormous burden on them,” Professor Ellis said. “In provinces
where high schools are doing a blend of online and face-to-face, the
preparation will be just a nightmare.”

Professor Westheimer, however, did have some encouraging news about one
frequently raised concern.

“From the very beginning, people were kind of obsessed with whether kids
are going to fall behind or if they could catch up to their peers,” he
said. “Stop worrying. This is an unprecedented disaster and it’s
worldwide. Who are they falling behind? Everyone’s out of school.”

The Times is making education during the pandemic a special focus of its
reporting. That effort includes a new newsletter on education and the
coronavirus for which you can [sign up

In the coming weeks, I’ll be contributing from Canada to that effort. So
if you have any particular concerns and observations about the return to

## The Drink

A few weeks ago, the Canada Letter spoke with Paul Fairie, a researcher
at the University of Calgary who, improbably, revived that city’s
interest in Cronk. (Those of you who missed the newsletter about the
long-forgotten 19th-century beverage, and its cryptic approach to
advertising, [can catch up
here.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/24/world/canada/cronk.html))

Using a somewhat imprecise, industrial scale Cronk recipe, the Cold
Garden Beverage Company in Calgary brewed a batch. Two batches to be
precise. The first one, made
with[blackstrap](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/02/what-is-blackstrap-molasses.html)rather
than [fancy-grade molasses,](https://www.crosbys.com/fancy-molasses/)
proved undrinkable.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After requests from several of you, I called Dr. Fairie this week, the
day after he knocked back his first glass of Cronk.

“It’s amazing to drink it,” Dr. Fairie said. Over all, Dr. he said,
Cronk has an herbal or spice flavor with noticeable flavors of molasses,
tea and root beer “but not the kind of root beer you buy today.” He
compared its aftertaste to that of prune juice.

In terms of style, he said that Cronk is more like an aperitif than
something to be consumed quickly and in large quantity.

Anyone else curious to try Cronk will have to wait — or may be
disappointed. Blake Belding, the head brewer at the Cold Garden Beverage
Company, told me that 1,500 [“stubbie”-style glass
bottles](https://www.canadianliving.com/food/entertaining/article/canadian-beer-bottles-do-you-know-your-history)
sold out in 11 hours. A remaining 200 will be offered for sale online
shortly while the brewery debates whether to produce more.

But Dr. Fairie isn’t sure that initial stampede means that Cronk will
again rise to its advertising claim of being “The Drink.”

“It’s very old-fashioned,” he
said.

Perhaps it was inevitable in this year of disruptions, but Canadian
politics did not take its usual summer vacation this week. First, Bill
Morneau stepped down as finance minister amid speculation about the
reason for his departure.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau replaced with him with Chrystia Freeland,
making her Canada’s first female finance minister. Then, to round things
out, the prime minister shut down the Parliamentary session.

He explained the move was necessary to reset the government’s agenda as
its focus turns to economic recovery. The opposition said that it was to
end their hearings into Mr. Trudeau’s role in the WE Charity affair.

During the recent Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, many

million Canadian dollars to people it arrested, in some cases using
kettling, during the 2010 G20 meeting.
