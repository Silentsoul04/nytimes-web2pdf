His assignments for leading magazines took him to pivotal events of the

Dan Budnik, a photographer who captured abiding images of 1950s artists
at work, key events of the civil rights movement, the Hudson River
restoration effort, Native Americans in the Southwest and more, died on
Aug. 14 at an assisted living residence in Tucson, Ariz. He was 87.

His nephew, Kim Newton, said the causes were metabolic encephalopathy
and dementia.

Mr. Budnik shot assignments for Life, Look and numerous other leading
magazines, and his work was collected in several books, including
“Marching to the Freedom Dream” (2014), which featured his pictures
from three significant civil rights moments: the 1958 Youth March for
Integrated Schools, the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
and the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965.

There were many photographers at those events, but Mr. Budnik had a
knack for the unexpected yet telling moment. At the March on Washington,
where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream”
speech, Mr. Budnik took a position behind Dr. King as he addressed the
enormous crowd from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I knew everyone else would be photographing him from the front and the
sides,” he said in an interview in “Marching to the Freedom Dream.” “But
I’m about six steps above him, knowing he had to exit in reverse and go
up the steps to where I was.”

He was rewarded with memorable images of Dr. King being swarmed by well
wishers. One showed a white man eager to shake Dr. King’s
hand.

“But King is a sardine, looking at all these bodies between them,” Mr.
Budnik said. “The guy is leaning on the tops of heads of people. He’s so
adamant about shaking Dr. King’s hand. And so King squirrels around,
corkscrews, frees up an arm. And then they do the brotherhood clasp.”

At the Selma march, almost two years later, Mr. Budnik again looked for
evocative moments. One came when a Black teenager unfurled an American
flag and started to march. Mr. Budnik captured the image of an Army
National Guard sergeant saluting — since guardsmen were taught to salute
the flag.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But, he recalled in an interview with The Austin American-Statesman in
2000, “the next seven guardsmen turned their backs to the boy with the
flag.”

Mr. Budnik’s nephew, who teaches at the University of Arizona’s School
of Journalism and is a noted photographer himself, learned his craft in
part by accompanying his uncle on photo shoots.

“Walking down the street or on a trail, he would point out objects or
subjects that most people would just pass by in their normal rush
through life,” Professor Newton said by email. “It was his awareness and
unconventional approach to life that helped bring about the intimacy one
sees in his work.”

Daniel Budnik was born on May 20, 1933, in Mineola, N.Y., on Long
Island. His father, Maxim, was a butcher, and his mother, Tessie
(Lesniak) Budnik, was a bookkeeper.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He grew up on Long Island and often told the story of an incident when
he was 5 that first made him aware of racial prejudice. Playing marbles
with a kindergarten classmate who had recently moved north from Alabama,
he was shocked when the boy saw a local Black man, who was well known in
the village, and started throwing rocks at him and describing him with a
racial
epithet.

“I could not come up with a logical explanation for his behavior,” Mr.
Budnik [told the British newspaper The
Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/on-the-road-to-civil-rights-extraordinary-images-of-the-selma-march-seen-for-the-first-time-10057218.html)
in 2015. “When I went to Selma in ’65, I thought about that boy.”

At 17, Mr. Budnik moved to the Los Angeles area to live with a sister.
He graduated from high school there and returned east to study at the
Art Students League of New York, thinking he might become a painter. But
in 1952 the artist Charles Alston, one of his teachers, showed him a
book by the photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson.

“Talk about epiphanies,” Mr. Budnik said. “It changed my life.”

First, though, came military service: He was drafted into the Army the
next year, serving until 1955. He used his mustering-out pay to buy a
Leica IIIf camera at a
pawnshop.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Among his first subjects were the Abstract Expressionists and other
artists he had come to know in New York. He began photographing them as
they worked, continuing to do so into the mid-1960s, capturing Willem de
Kooning, Lee Bontecou, David Smith and many others.

Decades later, living in Arizona, he frequently photographed another
artist, Georgia O’Keeffe, in her later years. His pictures of artists
were compiled into several gallery shows.

Mr. Budnik took a desk job with the agency [Magnum
Photos](https://www.magnumphotos.com/) in 1957, learning from some of
its top photographers. By the end of the decade he was a professional
photographer himself, generally working as a freelancer. His work in
Alabama in 1965, for instance, started out as an assignment for Life: He
had pitched the idea of photographing the segregationist side of the
civil rights movement.

He had arranged meetings with Gov. George C. Wallace and [Jim
Clark](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/06/07/us/07clark.html),
the notorious racist sheriff, when the clash known as [Bloody
Sunday](https://www.history.com/news/selma-bloody-sunday-attack-civil-rights-movement)
took place in Selma, followed by a Selma-to-Montgomery march, disrupting
his original plan. His images of the march never made any magazine, but
decades later, at the urging of his son, Aaron, he turned them into a
gallery show and then a book.

In the meantime he had also become involved with his friend Pete
Seeger’s efforts to clean up the Hudson River. He shot photos for a
Look article about the waterway in 1969. He had also taken an interest
in the Native American life and culture in Arizona, where he eventually
settled.

As with his involvement in the Hudson River campaign, he did more than
take pictures; for example, he helped the Navajo and Hopi peoples resist
strip mining.

“I was, in effect, an unpaid lobbyist for Native American causes,” he
told Arizona Highways magazine in 2014.

His photographs illustrate “The Book of Elders: The Life Stories and
Wisdom of Great American Indians” (1994), a project he created with
Sandy Johnson.

Mr. Budnik’s marriage to Toby Gemperle in 1959 ended in divorce in 1962.
His marriage to Kirsten Williams in 1988 ended in divorce in 1990. In
addition to his nephew and his son, from his first marriage, he is
survived by a grandson.
