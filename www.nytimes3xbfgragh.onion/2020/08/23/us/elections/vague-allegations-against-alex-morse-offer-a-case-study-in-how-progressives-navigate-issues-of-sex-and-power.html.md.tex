On Aug. 7, the student newspaper at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst reported that the state chapter of the College Democrats had
disinvited
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/politics/massachusetts-elections-markey-kennedy-neal-morse.html}{Alex
Morse}, a congressional candidate and former guest lecturer at the
university, from its future events, claiming ``numerous incidents'' of
unwanted and inappropriate advances toward students.

Then
\href{https://theintercept.com/2020/08/12/alex-morse-college-democrats-chats/}{messages}
were published by The Intercept showing that members of the College
Democrats had discussed how they might damage Mr. Morse's campaign, with
one suggesting it might help his career prospects with Mr. Morse's
opponent, Representative Richard E. Neal, the chairman of the
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.

Today, Mr. Morse is still in the race and says the allegations have only
helped his campaign. And the allegations and their aftermath offer a
case study in how progressives are navigating issues of sex and power in
politics.
