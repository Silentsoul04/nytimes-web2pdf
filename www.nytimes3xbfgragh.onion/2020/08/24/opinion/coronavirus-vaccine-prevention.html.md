# A Vaccine That Stops Covid-19 Won’t Be Enough

</div>

The best vaccines don’t just prevent a disease; they also prevent the
pathogen causing the disease from being transmitted. So why aren’t we
focusing more on those?

Not long after the new coronavirus first surfaced last December, an
ambitious prediction was made: A vaccine would be available [within 12
to 18
months](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/scientists-are-moving-record-speed-create-new-coronavirus-vaccines-they-may-come-too),
and it would stop the pandemic.

Despite serious challenges — how to mass manufacture, supply and deliver
a vaccine worldwide — the first prong of that wish could well be
fulfilled. [Eight vaccine
candidates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
are undergoing large-scale efficacy tests, so-called Phase 3 trials, and
results are expected by the end of this year or early 2021.

But even if one, or more, of those efforts succeeds, a vaccine might not
end the pandemic. This is partly because we seem to be focused at the
moment on developing the kind of vaccine that may well prevent Covid-19,
the disease, but that wouldn’t do enough to stop the transmission of
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

Doctors [usually explain
vaccines](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/how-do-vaccines-work) to patients
and the parents of young children by describing how those protect us
from a particular disease: An attenuated form of a pathogen, or just a
bit of it, is inoculated into the human body in order to trigger its
immune response; having learned to fight off that pathogen once, the
body will remember how to fend off the disease should it be exposed to
the same pathogen later.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A vaccine’s ability to forestall a disease is also how vaccine
developers typically design — and how regulators typically evaluate —
Phase 3 clinical trials for vaccine candidates.

Yet the best vaccines also serve another, critical, function: They block
a pathogen’s transmission from one person to another. And this result,
often called an [“indirect” effect of
vaccination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55wOg9fe_Ms), is no less
important than the direct effect of preventing the disease caused by
that pathogen. In fact, during a pandemic, it probably is even more
important.

That’s what we should be focusing on right now. And yet we are not.

Stopping a virus’s transmission reduces the entire population’s overall
exposure to the virus. It protects people who may be too frail to
respond to a vaccine, who do not have access to the vaccine, who refuse
to be immunized and whose immune response might wane over time.

The benefits of this approach have been demonstrated with other
pathogens and other diseases.

The Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) conjugate vaccines were
designed, and licensed in the early 1990s, to prevent young children
from developing [serious
infections](https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Abstract/1988/03000/Efficacy_of_Haemophilus_influenzae_type_b_capsular.3.aspx)
such as meningitis. Soon enough an unexpected and welcome side benefit
became clear: The vaccine [interrupted the bacterium’s
transmission](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/171/1/93/904530?redirectedFrom=fulltext);
after its introduction, occurrences of the disease dropped also[in
groups that had not been
vaccinated](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10004755).

The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were developed to prevent
cervical cancer and genital warts in women. They have proved [immensely
effective](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/vaccines.html) among
the women to whom they are administered — and up to 50 percent effective
at preventing genital warts [among unvaccinated
men](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2663-7),
according to a 2017 study of the health insurance records for 2005-10 of
some nine million people in Germany.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To understand why this is the case, remember what it takes for you to
become ill from a pathogen, be it a virus or a bacterium.

First, you are exposed to it. Then it infects you. While you are
infected, you may infect others. In some cases, the infection develops
into a disease. In other cases, it doesn’t: Though infected, you remain
asymptomatic.

One way that vaccines can interrupt a pathogen’s transmission cycle is
by preventing the pathogen from causing an infection in the first place.
This is how many common vaccines — against
[measles](https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/Module_on_Measles_Immunology_26Aug08.pdf?ua=1),
[mumps](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/97885/9789241500661_eng.pdf;jsessionid=06BE7879E677A7A70606302A705BA98E?sequence=1),
[rubella](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43922/9789241596848_eng.pdf?sequence=1)
and
[chickenpox](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43906/9789241596770_eng.pdf?sequence=1)
— operate.

Other vaccines — like the ones against [meningococcal
meningitis](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa610/5843568?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
or [pneumonia brought on by the pneumococcus
bacterium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6611220/pdf/main.pdf)
— can block the transmission of the pathogen by interfering with the
infection or by decreasing either the quantity of pathogen that the
infected patient sheds or the duration of the shedding period.

Some recipients of the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine simply don’t get
infected with the bacterium; others do get infected and carry the
bacterium in their nose, but [in smaller amounts and for shorter periods
of
time](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201503-0542OC)
than if they had not been vaccinated.

Much still needs to be learned about precisely how such mechanisms work
— what part do
[antibodies](https://www.britannica.com/science/antibody) play? [T
cells](https://www.britannica.com/science/T-cell)? — but the upshot from
these examples is this: Vaccines can block the transmission of viruses
or bacteria, and they can do so in several ways.

Given the communitywide benefits of accomplishing that, especially in a
pandemic, current vaccine-development efforts should prioritize finding
vaccines that limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The [U.S. Food and Drug
Administration](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download) has stated
that preventing a SARS-CoV-2 infection is in itself a sufficient
endpoint for the Phase 3 trials of vaccine candidates — that it is an
acceptable alternative goal to preventing the development of Covid-19.
The [World Health
Organization](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/blue-print/who-target-product-profiles-for-covid-19-vaccines.pdf?sfvrsn=1d5da7ca_5&download=true)
has said that “shedding/transmission” is as well.

These guidelines are an important signal, especially considering that
the F.D.A. has never approved a vaccine based on its effects on
infection alone; instead, the agency has focused exclusively on the
vaccine’s effectiveness at disease prevention.

And yet vaccine developers do not seem to be heeding this new call.

Based on our review of the Phase 3 tests listed at
[ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=vaccine%2C+phase+3%2C+efficacy&recrs=ab&type=Intr&cond=covid-19&fund=2),
a database of trials conducted around the world, the primary goal in
each of these studies is to reduce the occurrence of Covid-19.

Four of the six Covid-19 vaccine trials for which information is
available say they will also evaluate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2
infections among subjects — but only as an ancillary outcome.

This approach is shortsighted: One cannot assume that a vaccine that
prevents the development of Covid-19 in a patient will necessarily also
limit the risk that the patient will transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other
people.

For example, a study of young Australian teenagers published in the New
England Journal of Medicine early this year found that the vaccine used
to prevent the diseases caused by the B strain of meningococcus in
children and teenagers “[had no discernible
effect](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1900236)” on the
presence of the relevant bacterium in the throats of vaccinated subjects
displaying no symptoms.

The inactivated polio vaccine prevalent in many developed countries
today, known as IPV, is [highly effective at protecting individuals
against
polio](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/effectiveness-duration-protection.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20inactivated%20polio,of%20IPV%20and%20tOPV%2C%20or).
But it is [far less effective at reducing viral
shedding](https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/poliomyelitis/endgame_objective2/rationale/en/index3.html),
at least in fecal excretions, than the oral vaccine, known as OPV, used
more widely in other parts of the world.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the late 1990s, the United States, like other wealthy countries,
replaced with an acellular vaccine the killed-whole-cell pertussis
vaccine it had previously used against whooping cough. A resurgence of
whooping cough already was underway, but it
[accelerated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5580413/pdf/f1000research-6-12588.pdf)
then: Although the new vaccine was better than the previous one at
protecting the inoculated from the disease, it was [less good at
blocking transmission](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/787.long) of
the bacterium that causes the cough.

Conversely, a vaccine that, let’s say, offers older adults only modest
protection against developing a disease might nonetheless be very
effective, when administered to healthy adults or children, at curbing a
pathogen’s transmission in a population overall.

This is the case with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. [A 2015
study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1408544) published in
the New England Journal of Medicine found that the vaccine reduced the
occurrence of pneumonia in inoculated adults age 65 or older by only
about 45 percent. Yet, according to [a study last
year](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6846a5.htm) by
researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
Stanford University, the immunization of infants and toddlers reduced
ninefold the incidence of pneumococcal disease in the elderly.

With some vaccines, for some diseases, the indirect benefits of
vaccination can be greater than the direct effects.

Based on these precedents, it could be a grave mistake for vaccine
developers now to hew only, or too closely, to the single-minded goal of
preventing Covid-19, the disease.

Doing so could mean privileging vaccines that don’t block the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at all, or abandoning vaccines that block
transmission well enough but that, by prevailing standards, are deemed
to not forestall enough the development of Covid-19.

That, in turn, would essentially mean that the only way to ever get rid
of SARS-CoV-2 would be near-universal immunization — a herculean task.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Focusing on how to block the coronavirus’s transmission is a much more
efficient approach.

This is why randomized controlled trials of the vaccines currently under
consideration should include regular monitoring for the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 in study subjects. The goal should be to evaluate whether the
subjects acquire the infection at all, and for how long, as well as how
abundantly they shed and spread the virus, when and how.

Studying these issues could also help cast a light on the role of
so-called superspreading events in this
pandemic.

[More](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/)
and
[more](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/health/coronavirus-superspreading-contagion.html)
research suggests that a very small number of instances — gatherings at
restaurants or bars, [choir
rehearsal](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/health/coronavirus-choir.html),
funerals, [church
services](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53620633) — might account
for a vast majority of the cases of infection overall.

But the discussion about those instances has tended to focus on their
settings and circumstances, such as the presence of crowds in confined
spaces for extended periods of time.

Yet the question of whether some infected individuals, perhaps
especially at certain stages of infection, are particularly infectious —
whether they, themselves, are superspreaders — also needs to be studied
head-on: When does contagiousness peak in whom and why? And can vaccines
modify any of that?

The best vaccines don’t just protect the inoculated from getting sick
from a disease. They also protect everyone else from even contracting
the pathogen that causes that disease.

Preventing the very transmission of SARS-CoV-2, no less than stopping it
from turning into Covid-19, should be a main priority of current efforts
to develop the vaccines to end this pandemic.
