Young people have been on the forefront of political movements for
generations. Yet for almost as long, voter turnout in the United States
among people under 30 has been low.

This year, Gen Z and millennial voters will account for 37 percent of
eligible voters.

But political strategists wonder whether young people will show up to
vote, given the challenges in voting during a pandemic and possible
disenchantment with the political process.

If you consider yourself Gen Z or millennial and are eligible to vote,
we'd like to hear from you.

What is driving you to vote or what's holding you back? Submit a video
with your answers and they may be featured in
\href{https://timesevents.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/election2020/article}{an
upcoming New York Times event}. We'd love to include your perspective.

When taking your video, we'd appreciate if you could:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Shoot vertically, leaving room at the top of the frame.
\item
  Keep each video under one minute (you can pick which questions to
  video).
\item
  Make sure you're in a brightly lit area (but not too bright).
\item
  Be in a place where we can hear you clearly.
\end{itemize}
