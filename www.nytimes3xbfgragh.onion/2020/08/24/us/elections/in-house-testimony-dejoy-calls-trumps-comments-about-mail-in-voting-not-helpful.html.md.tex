Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, appeared before lawmakers again on
Monday, this time testifying to the Democratic-run House oversight
committee. He faced much tougher questioning than he did
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/us/politics/dejoy-postal-service-senate-hearing.html}{on
Friday}, when he testified before a committee of the Republican-run
Senate.

In his opening remarks, Mr. DeJoy continued defending the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/15/us/post-office-vote-by-mail.html}{cost-cutting
measures} he has put in place and pushed back against suggestions that
the changes were intended to influence the 2020 election by making
mail-in voting less reliable.

He told the lawmakers that while some changes he had implemented, such
as reducing overtime, had caused delays, those issues were being
addressed.

``While we have had temporary service decline, which should not have
happened, we are fixing this,'' Mr. DeJoy said.

Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the
chairwoman of the oversight committee, said the expectation that his
changes at the agency would not cause mail delays reflected
``incompetence at best.''

After Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts,
repeatedly asked whether Mr. DeJoy would return the mail-sorting
machines that have already been removed from post offices, the postal
leader barked, ``I will not.'' He then added that Mr. Lynch had spread
``misinformation'' during his furious monologue.

When introducing Mr. DeJoy, Representative Mark Walker, Republican of
North Carolina, accused Democrats of trying to ``cancel'' Mr. DeJoy for
purely partisan reasons.

``How sad is it when the cancel culture has reached the halls of
Congress,'' Mr. Walker said. ``The man sitting before this committee
today is not who the Democrats have villainized him to be. He's here
today because he supported President Trump.''

Democrats have been leery of Mr. DeJoy's role as a megadonor to
Republicans and President Trump, who has sown distrust about mail-in
voting on Sunday. Mr. DeJoy acknowledged in the House committee hearing
that he did not find Mr. Trump's comments helpful.

``I have put word around to different people that this is not helpful,''
he said, in response to a question from Representative Gerald Connolly
of Virginia.
