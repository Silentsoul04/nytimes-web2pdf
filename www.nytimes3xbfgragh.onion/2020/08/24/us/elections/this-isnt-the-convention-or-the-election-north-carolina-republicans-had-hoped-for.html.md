For most of the past decade, North Carolina was a showcase for the
Republican Party’s growth — its strength in the suburbs, in rural areas
and in races up and down the ballot proving that it could dominate in
parts of the country where demographics favored the Democrats. Now [it
could be a victim of its own
excess](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/politics/north-carolina-charlotte-rnc.html).

After victories in 2010, when Republicans took control of the state
legislature for the first time in more than 100 years, and in 2012, when
a Republican won the governor’s race, they used their power in the State
Capitol to carry out a sweeping conservative agenda that included tax
cuts, caps on medical malpractice damages and ending tenure for
teachers.

But some of their most contentious moves — creating highly
[gerrymandered](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/11/29/us/politics/north-carolina-gerrymandering.html)
congressional districts,
[restrictions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/25/us/north-carolina-law-antidiscrimination-pat-mccrory.html)
on gay and transgender rights that prompted national boycotts, and
[curbs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/16/us/pat-mccrory-roy-cooper-north-carolina.html)
on the power of the Democratic governor — backfired with voters and the
courts, which struck down many of them.

Now, embattled Republican lawmakers find their fates intertwined with
those of President Trump, a deeply polarizing figure who won here in
2016 by three percentage points but has pushed many voters to their
limits with his hectoring style and mismanagement of a coronavirus
outbreak that is still spreading throughout the state.

North Carolina was supposed to be a more promising opportunity for
Republicans, which is why they [selected
Charlotte](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/20/us/politics/republican-2020-convention-charlotte.html),
its largest city, as the site of the [Republican National
Convention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/politics/how-to-watch-republican-convention.html)
this year. But when the pandemic made that kind of mass gathering
unsafe, Mr. Trump got into a spat with state and local officials and
moved the festivities to Jacksonville, Fla., only to cancel once that
plan proved unfeasible.

A much more scaled-down gathering is taking place in Charlotte this week
as several hundred Republican officials from across the country [meet to
vote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/22/us/politics/Republican-delegates-charlotte-trump.html)
on relatively mundane party matters — their movements tracked by
Bluetooth sensors and their faces shielded by masks.

Polls show former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tied with Mr. Trump
in the state. And the president’s standing is dragging down the
incumbent Republican senator, Thom Tillis, who is trailing his
Democratic opponent, Cal Cunningham, in most polls.
