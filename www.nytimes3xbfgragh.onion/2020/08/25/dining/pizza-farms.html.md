In parts of the Upper Midwest, the phrase “pizza farm” is as evocative
of summer food as “juneberry pie,” “[butter
cow](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/12/us/politics/on-politics-iowa-fair-booker-ferris-wheel.html)”
and “rutabaga festival.” (The [88th annual
celebration](http://www.cumberland-wisconsin.com/rutabaga-events-2020)
begins Saturday in Cumberland, Wis.)

Trace the route of the Mississippi River down from
[Minneapolis](https://twincities.eater.com/maps/pizza-farm-minnesota-wisconsin)
and along the Wisconsin-Iowa border. In the last two decades, dozens of
farms in this region have built wood-fired ovens, studied the basics of
crust, sauce and cheese, and begun serving pizza on summer nights.

Families haul in stacks of camp chairs; couples on dates sip wine on
picnic blankets; children poke at the animals and run themselves out by
dark. Pizza is usually the only item on the menu, but the homegrown
toppings change with the season, from baby onions and roasted carrots in
the spring to zucchini, fried eggplant and red peppers as the season
closes out in September. In tune with the farm-to-table, local and
sustainable food movements, pizza farming has spread across the country.

Ted Fisher and Robbi Bannen of [the A to Z
farm](https://atozproduceandbakery.com/) in Stockholm, Wis., started
serving pizza in 1998, and many other farmers credit them as local
pioneers. They kept it up every summer because, they say, it has
supported them in so many ways: using up gluts of summer produce, giving
their three children skills and spending money, and drawing locals onto
the farm. Those customers became regulars — and, often, C.S.A. members,
the lifeblood of the farm.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“That’s why this is like a death in the family,” Ms. Bannen said of
their decision to cancel pizza nights this summer because of the
coronavirus pandemic.

But some pizza farms are having a blockbuster season: Like drive-in
movie theaters, they happen to be perfectly suited to outdoor operations
and social distancing. Across the country, new pizza farms have sprung
up this summer, as farmers [scramble to make
up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/dining/farm-to-table-coronavirus.html)
for lost sales to restaurants and other big customers.

“The landscape has completely changed,” said Liz Neumark, who just
opened up her [Katchkie Farm](https://www.katchkiefarm.com/) in
Kinderhook, N.Y., to a weekend collaboration with [Hilltown Hot
Pies](https://www.instagram.com/hilltownhotpies/), a local specialist.
“I never knew there were pizza groupies.”

Farm-to-table pizza has been around since the food revolution of the
1970s, but usually closer to the table than to the farm. By the time the
Los Angeles chef [Wolfgang
Puck](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/31/dining/wolfgang-puck-the-original-celebrity-chef-is-still-keeping-busy.html)
made his reputation by turning pizza into high-end restaurant food in
the 1980s, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, Calif., was [already
famous](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1984/07/08/magazine/getting-to-know-calzone.html)
for its [wood-fired
pies](https://food52.com/blog/25282-my-family-recipe-coming-home-pizza-dough),
topped with foraged greens like nettles and wild
herbs.

Particularly determined pizza farmers even raise cattle for cheese and
pigs for meat. The popular Iowa Margherita pie at [Luna Valley
Farm](https://www.lunavalleyfarm.com/), in Decorah, Iowa, has Italian
sausage crumbled over the basic formula of fresh tomatoes, mozzarella
and basil leaves. The only thing Tom and Maren Beard don’t make
themselves is drinks.

“We have three breweries in a 10-mile radius, local soda and natural
wine,” Ms. Beard said, and partnerships with local businesses have also
become part of the pizza farm ethos. (Liquor laws in these states often
allow farms to serve beer and wine.)

Many pizza farmers also see themselves as activists and teachers.
Educational sites like Katchkie Farm, the [Edible
Schoolyard](https://edibleschoolyard.org/berkeley) in Berkeley, Calif.,
and the [Yale Farm](https://www.sustainablefood.yale.edu/the-yale-farm)
in New Haven, Conn., have long used pizza ovens to introduce students to
the principles (and pleasures) of diverse, local and sustainable
agriculture. For these farmers, pizza is an ideal teaching tool: Even a
small farm can raise wheat for dough, tomatoes and herbs for sauce, and
an array of vegetables for toppings.

“We didn’t start making pizza as a concept; we were just trying to find
something that worked for us.” Ms. Bannen said. “I’m waiting for someone
to open a taco farm.”

Here are five popular pizza
farms:

When Emily Knudsen took her new boyfriend, Bill Bartz, to his first
pizza night at a nearby farm, he had a “Sound of Music” moment. “He was
like Julie Andrews twirling around on that mountain,” she said, ready to
jump feet-first into her longtime dream.

Unlike many pizza farmers, neither of them had worked on a farm — Ms.
Knudsen, 37, has a background in hospitality and wedding planning, and
Mr. Bartz, also 37, in construction — but they threw themselves into it,
starting from scratch in 2014. Although they grow some ingredients
(basil, tomatoes, peppers and honey), their specialty is lavish
toppings, loaded onto pies like the Buster (two kinds of mozzarella,
sausage, caramelized onions, mushrooms, basil), the Sweet Georgia
(mozzarella, prosciutto, arugula, goat cheese, honey) and the Pig and
Pork (tomato sauce, mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni and green
olives).

Like many modern farmers, they have branched out from agriculture in
multiple directions, hosting corporate picnics and wedding rehearsal
dinners, and adding attractions like baby animals, live music and local
crafts to pull in a wider audience. (Waseca is a little more than an
hour’s drive south of the Twin Cities). By staying open this summer, the
farm has had its busiest pizza season ever, while enforcing a new
reservations-only policy and strict social distancing rules. “I’m a

## Hawkins Family Farm

### <span>North Manchester, Ind.</span>

This farm in Wabash County has been in the Hawkins family for four
generations. But Jeff Hawkins, 65, said he became a farmer only when he
resigned as pastor of a Lutheran Evangelical parish to devote himself to
agriculture. “Just like farming had become industrial,” he said,
churches had become concerned with cost-effectiveness and productivity.
“Pastors were becoming more like C.E.O.s and less like
shepherds.”

With his son, Zach, 38, Mr. Hawkins began diversifying the farm, where
they now produce vegetables, honey, grains, pigs, chickens, goats,
cattle and — on Friday nights — pizza. They committed to making the farm
a sustainable business that also funds a nonprofit dedicated to
reconnecting members of the clergy with agriculture, which Mr. Hawkins
believes promotes healthy and holistic leadership. “I was called to this
farm,” he
said.

Zach had also left the farm to attend college in Iowa, where he dove
into sustainable farming and dabbled in sourdough; on his return, he was
handed responsibility for the family’s pizza recipe and style. “I’m
always pushing the char,” he said: blistered, blackened, puffy edges are
prized signs of a well-cooked wood-fired pizza.

They bring the same holistic approach to partnerships with the
community: A local bakery makes the dough, and a young farmer trying to
keep his family’s nearby dairy farm going makes the mozzarella. Chefs
from restaurants in Fort Wayne, 40 miles to the east, are invited to
visit and experiment, using anything that grows on the farm as a pizza
topping. Kimchi and carrot-top pesto were recent hits.

“There aren’t many ‘Old MacDonald’ farms left,” Mr. Hawkins said,
explaining why opening diverse, sustainable farms to the public is so
important. “Pizza helps people see what agriculture really means.”

Ted Fisher and Robbi Bannen are not only credited as pioneers of the
pizza farm; they also believe they coined the term soon after they began
in 1998, quoting a 5-year-old visitor, Ms. Bannen said.

“We were food people way back when,” in the 1970s, Mr. Fisher said. (He
is now 62, Ms. Bannen is 61.) A skilled bread baker, he already knew how
to work with naturally leavened doughs, and adapted those skills to
pizza with help from Alice Waters’s classic 1980 cookbook, “Chez Panisse
Pizza, Pasta and Calzones.” When they put the word out that they would
be selling pizza for takeout one night a week, “to most people it looked
like an insane thing to do,” she said. At the time, most farms did not
serve hot food, any more than restaurants grew produce — though now both
practices are common.

They grow all the vegetables for tomato sauce and toppings, and wheat
for the flour. “There’s nothing better than being able to use up the
food that we grow,” Ms. Bannen said. Rather than guess how many peppers
they’ll need in a given year, or whether anyone will buy a new kind of
kale they want to try growing, they can take chances, knowing that
everything can end up on a pizza.

One night, a takeout customer asked to set up a folding table in the
yard. After that, everyone was invited to sprawl out under the stars. (A
to Z has been closed this summer, however, because of the virus.) Now
the farm has fed a generation: Visitors have had first dates, proposed
marriage and fed their babies at A to Z pizza nights.

“A lot of people around here no longer have family farms that they
remember,” she said. “After 22 years, that’s what we are — everyone’s
family farm.”

## Amber Waves Farm

### <span>Amagansett, N.Y.</span>

To most pizza farmers (and pizza lovers), the basic components of pizza
are the crust, the sauce, and the cheese. For Amanda Merrow and Katie
Baldwin, there is a crucial fourth: the flour.

Their farm, Amber Waves, is part of a growing movement to return the
cultivation of grain — like wheat, oats, sorghum, barley — to small
regional farms, instead of relying on industrial giants in the Great
Plains. Local grain, they say, has the [same
benefits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/27/dining/row-7-seed-company-dan-barber.html)
as local fruits and vegetables, contributing to flavor, sustainability,
and
community.

The sourdough starter for their pizza crust was donated by a previous
owner of the farm who had reportedly kept it going
[since 1968](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/02/01/nyregion/on-the-east-end-of-long-island-embracing-local-wheat.html),
and they have collaborated with
[Carissa’s](https://www.carissasthebakery.com/), a nearby bakery
famous for creative breads like pickled rye and slow-risen baguettes.
“The taste of flour made from freshly harvested grain is a totally
different thing,” said Ms. Merrow, 35. “And bakers around here are able
to appreciate that.”

When they opened Amber Waves in 2008, one of their first investments was
a mobile pizza oven. They introduced themselves to the community with
D.I.Y. family pizza nights: Children grab a dough ball, learn to roll it
out, then wander into the garden to pick the toppings.

“Even kids who don’t eat vegetables will eat pizza,” said Ms. Baldwin,
39. “Once a cherry tomato is on a pizza, it’s not a vegetable anymore —
it’s a topping.”

Amber Waves is moving in the opposite direction of development in its
ultrawealthy part of the Hamptons, using land for cultivation instead of
installing swimming pools. But much of the area was farmland until
relatively recently; potatoes, corn, wheat and more have thrived in this
soil for hundreds of years.

“We’re not bringing this in,” Ms. Merrow said. “We’re bringing it back.”

## Millsap Farms

### <span>Springfield, Mo.</span>

Curtis Millsap first heard about pizza farms soon after he and his wife
started farming in 2007, from Wwoofers arriving from Wisconsin. Those
volunteer workers from [Worldwide Opportunities on Organic
Farms](https://wwoofusa.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImPqDu5Cq6wIVCACGCh30LQTkEAAYASAAEgJnvPD_BwE)
hop from farm to farm as needed, often carrying new ideas and
innovations with
them.

“It sounded like this magical thing,” with fairy lights in the trees,
live music and wood-fired pizza under the stars, said Mr. Millsap, 44.
He and his wife, Sarah, 42, have raised 10 children on the farm, four
miles north of central Springfield. As the family has grown, their goals
have shifted from raising more vegetables to building more
relationships. They brought on a local mason to make them a mud oven —
the original high-heat baking technology — and enlisted their extended
family to help.

“If we were going to have the kind of community we wanted,” Mr. Millsap
said, “we would have to build it right here on the farm.”

Today, they host volunteers from all over the world, ask C.S.A. members
to work alongside them during planting and harvest, and entice locals to
the farm with all-you-can-eat pizza on Thursday nights from May to
October. The conversation about the week’s offerings begins around the
kitchen table on Monday mornings, with the question: What do we have a
lot of this
week?
