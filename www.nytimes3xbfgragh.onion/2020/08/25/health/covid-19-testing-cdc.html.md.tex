The revision prompted confusion and alarm from experts, who called the
move ``potentially dangerous.''

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html}{modified
its coronavirus testing guidelines} this week to exclude people who do
not have symptoms of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/health/coronavirus-steroids.html}{Covid-19}
--- even if they have been recently exposed to the virus.

Experts questioned the revision, pointing to the importance of
identifying infections in the small window immediately before the onset
of symptoms, when many individuals appear to be most contagious.

Models suggest that
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5}{about half of
transmission events} can be traced back to individuals still in this
so-called pre-symptomatic stage,
\href{https://www.pnas.org/content/117/30/17513}{before they start to
feel ill} --- if they ever feel sick at all.

``This is potentially dangerous,'' said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an
infectious disease physician in Palo Alto, Calif. Restricting testing to
only people with obvious symptoms of Covid-19 means ``you're not looking
for a lot of people who are potential spreaders of disease,'' she added.
``I feel like this is going to make things worse.''

At a moment when experts have almost universally come forward to
encourage more frequent and widespread testing, especially to reach
vulnerable and marginalized sectors of the population, the C.D.C.'s
update appears counterintuitive and ``very strange,'' said Susan
Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the Keck School of Medicine of
the University of Southern California.

Just weeks ago, the National Institutes of Health announced the first
round of grant recipients for its
\href{https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx}{Rapid
Acceleration of Diagnostics program}, or RADx, to scale up coronavirus
testing in the coming weeks and months. On the agency's RADx website,
officials underscore the importance of prioritizing tests that can
``detect people who are asymptomatic.''

A more lax approach to testing, experts said, could delay crucial
treatments,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/19/health/coronavirus-testing-viral-spread.html}{as
well as obscure, or even hasten, the coronavirus's spread in the
community}.

``I think it's bizarre,'' said Daniel Larremore, a mathematician and
infectious diseases modeler at the University of Colorado Boulder. ``Any
move right now to reduce levels of testing by changing guidelines is a
step in the wrong direction.''

Prior iterations of the C.D.C.'s testing guidelines struck a markedly
different tone, explicitly stating that ``testing is recommended for all
close contacts'' of people infected with the coronavirus, regardless of
symptoms. The agency also specifically emphasized ``the potential for
asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission'' as an important factor
in the spread of the virus.

The newest version, which was posted on Monday, amended the agency's
guidance to say that people who have been in close contact with an
infected individual --- typically defined as being within six feet of a
person with the coronavirus and for at least 15 minutes --- ``do not
necessarily need a test'' if they do not have symptoms. Exceptions, the
agency noted, might be made for ``vulnerable'' individuals, or if health
care providers or state or local public health officials recommend
testing.

``Wow, that is a walk-back,'' Dr. Butler-Wu said. ``We're in the middle
of a pandemic, and that's a really big change.''

Dr. Butler-Wu said she was concerned that the guidelines would be
misinterpreted as implying that people without symptoms were unable to
pass the coronavirus on to others --- a falsehood that experts had been
trying for months to dispel. ``If people are getting exposed, and
they're not getting tested, and they're not isolating, that's a huge
problem,'' Dr. Kuppalli said.

By the C.D.C.'s own estimates, roughly 40 percent of people infected
with the coronavirus may never go on to develop symptoms, remaining
asymptomatic for the duration of their tenure with the virus. These
numbers are tentative --- and ironically can't be confirmed without more
testing of people who appear entirely healthy.

Although researchers remain unsure how often asymptomatic people
unwittingly transmit the coronavirus, studies have shown that the
silently infected
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html}{can
carry the virus in high amounts}. The evidence is more clear-cut for
pre-symptomatic people, in whom virus levels tend to peak just before
illness sets in --- a period when these individuals
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/health/coronavirus-superspreading-contagion.html}{might
be mingling with their peers}, seeding superspreader events. Notably,
experts can't distinguish asymptomatic people from those who are
pre-symptomatic until symptoms do or don't appear.

``It seems backward to just ignore pre-symptomatic patients,'' Dr.
Butler-Wu said.

David Piegaro, who lives in Trenton, N.J., had sought out several tests
for the coronavirus in recent months, after events like funerals and
those that require travel because of his post in the National Guard. He
never experienced symptoms, and his tests have all been negative,
bringing him peace of mind, especially because he lives with his parents
and grandfather. ``I viewed testing as a good thing to do,'' he said.
``Asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus, so widespread
testing seems valuable.''

Tracking asymptomatic cases is also important from the perspective of
the infected, Dr. Kuppalli said. Less than a year into this pandemic,
experts still don't know the full extent of the long-term consequences
of contracting the coronavirus, even if the initial encounter seems
benign.

The reasons behind the surprise shift in testing recommendations are
unclear. In response to an inquiry from The New York Times, a
representative for the C.D.C. directed the questions to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. An H.H.S. spokesperson said
that asymptomatic testing could still be warranted ``when directed by
public health leaders or health care providers,'' and noted that testing
decisions should be ``based on individual circumstances and the status
of community spread.''

On Twitter,
\href{https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1298003530033147904/retweets/with_comments}{some
people speculated} that the Trump administration made the change to try
to address
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-testing-supply-shortage.html}{continuing
supply shortages}, which have stymied testing efforts in many parts of
the country, stretching turnaround times for results to weeks or more.
Many institutions and companies performing testing have prioritized
people with symptoms in their lineup as a way to expedite the return of
results for those most at risk for falling severely ill.

When asked about this, the H.H.S. spokesperson said that the
modification was not a response to sputtering supply chains. ``Testing
capacity has massively expanded, and we are not utilizing the full
capacity that we have developed,'' the spokesperson said. ``We revised
the guidance to reflect current evidence and the best public health
interventions.''

Poorly timed testing, if conducted infrequently,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/09/health/covid-testing.html}{could
lead to false positives or false negatives}, mistaking healthy people as
infected or vice versa. That's a potential risk if someone gets tested
too soon after being exposed to the coronavirus, Dr. Butler-Wu pointed
out.

Even so, anyone with a known exposure should quarantine and consider
seeking a test, Dr. Kuppalli said, adding, ``We still need to be
careful.''
