\subsection{Sneaky Circle of Life}\label{sneaky-circle-of-life}}

Our house in Gloucestershire, England, is full of flowers that Dad buys
for Mum. She's allergic to lilies but adores every other kind of plant,
tree or foliage. They fill our kitchen. Whenever a bunch of flowers
dies, Mum delights in opening the windows and flinging the flowers onto
the grass below to decompose and rejoin the earth. Dad knows flowers
can't decompose on the lawn but cannot bear to spoil Mum's joy in being
part of this circle of life. So, he sneaks outside, takes the dead
flowers and puts them in the compost bin. --- \emph{Lucy Hicks Beach}

\subsection{Bound by Groceries}\label{bound-by-groceries}}

I first saw her, masked yet elegant, near the onions. She passed me by
the lettuce with a gentle ``Excuse me.'' I passed her again by the
squash. Then we found each other by the peaches. We both fumbled to open
our plastic bags with plastic gloves on. Yet she seemed unfazed, almost
peaceful. At the prepared foods counter, she ordered salmon, so I
ordered salmon. I peered into her cart and noticed cherries, smiling at
my matching bag. That was it. Two socially distant strangers, bound
together by our bags of groceries. --- \emph{Melissa M.P. Baldwin}

Favored'}\label{the-bright-colors-he-favored}}

We stood in our grandfather's closet, five granddaughters taking in his
treasures. Time advanced through the neat rows: Skinny ties replacing
wider versions, oversized frames replacing sleeker ones. At the funeral
we tied his silk scarves in our hair, around our wrists and throats, and
spoke of how he made his love of life known in the bright colors he
favored, the care with which he presented himself to the world. We each
selected a pair of his glasses and one of his oversized sweatshirts,
holding them close. Our treasures now. --- \emph{Dayna Sason}

selected from his closet.

\subsection{When Leaving Is Loving}\label{when-leaving-is-loving}}

I was having unrelenting, debilitating panic attacks. I had lost 10
pounds in 10 days. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't calm down. I
asked my husband to leave for a week. I was afraid I would end up losing
him over this, but I needed to be alone. At my request, he left, and in
his absence, I calmed down. When he returned, I was grateful. I needed
to be selfish, and he was able to be unselfish for me. It was the most
loving thing he could have done. --- \emph{Amy Goldmacher}

Happy and healthy at home.
