Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, told Congress on Monday that the
Postal Service could be trusted to carry out the largest vote-by-mail
program in American history without political bias, even as President
Trump repeated baseless accusations that mail-in voting would be used by
his rivals to rig the November election against him.

Under tough questioning by Democrats on the House oversight committee,
Mr. DeJoy, a major donor to Mr. Trump and other Republicans, mounted an
outraged defense of the [modifications he has
made](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-usps-mail-delays.html)
at the Postal Service that have thrust the agency into a political
firestorm, denying that they were motivated by partisanship. He refused
to commit to reversing the changes, which he characterized as vital
cost-cutting measures for a cash-strapped agency badly in need of an
overhaul, and scolded Congress for failing for years to attend to the
post office’s financial woes.

While he conceded that some of the changes he had put in place, such as
reducing overtime and limiting trips, had caused service delays, Mr.
DeJoy maintained that the issues were being rectified and hotly
denounced suggestions from Democratic lawmakers that he was working to
help Mr. Trump politically.

“I am not engaged in sabotaging the election,” Mr. DeJoy told lawmakers.

But even as he spoke, Mr. Trump was [delivering an extraordinary
diatribe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/24/us/rnc-convention-election/democrats-are-using-covid-to-steal-the-election-trump-says-in-an-inflammatory-rnc-speech)
against voting by mail in an unannounced appearance at the Republican
National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., where he sought to sow mistrust
in the process and claimed without evidence that Democrats were “using
Covid to steal the election.”

The performance made for an awkward contrast with Mr. DeJoy, who spent
the day trying to reassure Congress about the Postal Service’s role in
helping to administer an election without political influence.
Reiterating comments he made last week [before a Senate
panel](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/us/politics/dejoy-postal-service-senate-hearing.html),
Mr. DeJoy criticized the “false narrative” that he said was being
promoted about both his intentions and the changes at the agency, which
he described as necessary to address the Postal Service’s financial
challenges. Civil rights groups, state attorneys general and Democrats
have asserted instead that they are part of a concerted [attempt,
directed by Mr. Trump, to disenfranchise
voters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/24/us/rnc-convention-election/democrats-are-using-covid-to-steal-the-election-trump-says-in-an-inflammatory-rnc-speech).
