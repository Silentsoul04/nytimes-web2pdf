Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, told Congress on Monday that the
Postal Service could be trusted to carry out the largest vote-by-mail
program in American history without political bias, even as President
Trump repeated baseless accusations that mail-in voting would be used by
his rivals to rig the November election against him.

Under tough questioning by Democrats on the House oversight committee,
Mr. DeJoy, a major donor to Mr. Trump and other Republicans, mounted an
outraged defense of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-usps-mail-delays.html}{modifications
he has made} at the Postal Service that have thrust the agency into a
political firestorm, denying that they were motivated by partisanship.
He refused to commit to reversing the changes, which he characterized as
vital cost-cutting measures for a cash-strapped agency badly in need of
an overhaul, and scolded Congress for failing for years to attend to the
post office's financial woes.

While he conceded that some of the changes he had put in place, such as
reducing overtime and limiting trips, had caused service delays, Mr.
DeJoy maintained that the issues were being rectified and hotly
denounced suggestions from Democratic lawmakers that he was working to
help Mr. Trump politically.

``I am not engaged in sabotaging the election,'' Mr. DeJoy told
lawmakers.

But even as he spoke, Mr. Trump was

an extraordinary diatribe} against voting by mail in an unannounced
appearance at the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.,
where he sought to sow mistrust in the process and claimed without
evidence that Democrats were ``using Covid to steal the election.''

The performance made for an awkward contrast with Mr. DeJoy, who spent
the day trying to reassure Congress about the Postal Service's role in
helping to administer an election without political influence.
Reiterating comments he made last week
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/us/politics/dejoy-postal-service-senate-hearing.html}{before
a Senate panel}, Mr. DeJoy criticized the ``false narrative'' that he
said was being promoted about both his intentions and the changes at the
agency, which he described as necessary to address the Postal Service's
financial challenges. Civil rights groups, state attorneys general and
Democrats have asserted instead that they are part of a concerted

directed by Mr. Trump, to disenfranchise voters}.
