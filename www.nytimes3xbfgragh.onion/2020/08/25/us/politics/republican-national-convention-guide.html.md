The second night of the [Republican National
Convention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/politics/how-to-watch-republican-convention.html)
kicks off Tuesday evening, a day after speakers including Senator Tim
Scott of South Carolina, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, Donald Trump
Jr., and others painted a disjointed portrait of their Democratic
opponents and the country.

At times, the tone was dark — as speakers warned of a supposed societal
collapse if Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected to the White House and if
Democrats won sweeping victories in Congress. Mr. Scott and Ms. Haley,
two Republicans who are rumored to be eyeing a 2024 presidential run,
sought to weave their jabs at liberals with a more traditional message
of inspiration and small government.

Tuesday night’s lineup features an eclectic blend of speakers, including
three members of Mr. Trump’s immediate family. The message will most
likely tread similar ground: that November’s election is a crossroads
for the country, and that re-electing President Trump is a moral
necessity.

## Who’s speaking on Tuesday?

The first lady, **[Melania
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/style/melania-trump-republican-national-convention.html),**
will anchor the evening, and two of the president’s adult children —
**Eric Trump** and **Tiffany Trump** — will also speak.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Similar to Monday night, which featured a video message from the St.
Louis couple who gained viral fame after pointing a gun at protesters,
Tuesday’s lineup also features a veteran of internet mudslinging:
**Nicholas Sandmann.** Mr. Sandmann was the high school student whose
interaction with a Native American protester went viral online and drew
immediate condemnation. But later, new camera angles revealed that Mr.
Sandmann was not antagonizing the protester as initially thought, and he
has since become a hero of conservative media.

Other speakers will include Secretary of State **Mike Pompeo**; ****
former Attorney General **Pam Bondi** of Florida; **** and Gov. **Kim
Reynolds** of Iowa. Mr. Pompeo’s appearance in particular has been
criticized as outside the political bounds of a cabinet figure whose
post is often associated with apolitical diplomacy.

## A television feel? Or rally speeches?

The stark contrast in tone and message between the Democrats and
Republicans was not the only thing on display Monday; there was also
their different approaches to hosting a convention that has been upended
by the coronavirus outbreak. While Democrats leaned in fully to the
television format, having actresses serve as the evening’s moderators
and producing several slick videos to thread between speeches, the first
night of the [Republican
convention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-convention-election)
had the feel of one of Mr. Trump’s signature rallies — just with no live
audience. Rather than taped remarks, almost all Republicans gave live
speeches in Washington, D.C. There was less pre-preduction besides a
video narrated by the actor Jon Voight, which was repeated twice in the
first night’s broadcast.

During one segment, Mr. Trump seemed to take a play from the Democratic
convention a week prior, holding round tables with Americans who had
been affected by the coronavirus and another with former hostages and
detainees freed by Mr. Trump’s administration. Except, while the
Democrats’ listening sessions with Mr. Biden were highly choreographed
and conducted virtually, Mr. Trump’s was freewheeling and in person.
Conservatives have bragged on holding more live speeches, saying they
believe it will give Americans a more authentic experience. It could be,
however, that they are trying to hold on to a format that doesn’t
translate as well to the small screen.

## Does Wisconsin come up?

Republicans have tried to pitch the protests about Black Lives Matter
and police brutality against Democrats, casting protesters as violent
actors seeking to destroy America. In the past 24 hours, they have added
a new talking point: the fires and destruction that took place in
Kenosha, Wis., after police officers were captured on camera shooting a
Black man named Jacob Blake multiple times in the back.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On the first night of the convention, Republicans falsely said that Mr.
Biden wanted to defund police departments and that he encouraged rioters
actions throughout the country. Republicans could refresh that argument
with the shooting of Mr. Blake and try to force Mr. Biden into a corner
between his progressive flank that wants him to embrace systemic
policing reform and moderates that want him to avoid it.

In previous instances, Mr. Biden has shrugged off these attempts at
driving a wedge. The Biden campaign has repeatedly said he does not
support police abolition or defunding police departments. He has
expressed sympathy for Black victims of police violence and said
officers should be held accountable.
