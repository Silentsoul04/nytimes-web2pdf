Three of President Trump's family members will speak tonight, including

The second night of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/politics/how-to-watch-republican-convention.html}{Republican
National Convention} kicks off Tuesday evening, a day after speakers
including Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, former Ambassador Nikki
Haley, Donald Trump Jr., and others painted a disjointed portrait of
their Democratic opponents and the country.

At times, the tone was dark --- as speakers warned of a supposed
societal collapse if Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected to the White House
and if Democrats won sweeping victories in Congress. Mr. Scott and Ms.
Haley, two Republicans who are rumored to be eyeing a 2024 presidential
run, sought to weave their jabs at liberals with a more traditional
message of inspiration and small government.

Tuesday night's lineup features an eclectic blend of speakers, including
three members of Mr. Trump's immediate family. The message will most
likely tread similar ground: that November's election is a crossroads
for the country, and that re-electing President Trump is a moral
necessity.

\subsection{Who's speaking on Tuesday?}\label{whos-speaking-on-tuesday}}

The first lady,
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/style/melania-trump-republican-national-convention.html}{Melania
Trump},} will anchor the evening, and two of the president's adult
children --- \textbf{Eric Trump} and \textbf{Tiffany Trump} --- will
also speak.

Similar to Monday night, which featured a video message from the St.
Louis couple who gained viral fame after pointing a gun at protesters,
Tuesday's lineup also features a veteran of internet mudslinging:
\textbf{Nicholas Sandmann.} Mr. Sandmann was the high school student
whose interaction with a Native American protester went viral online and
drew immediate condemnation. But later, new camera angles revealed that
Mr. Sandmann was not antagonizing the protester as initially thought,
and he has since become a hero of conservative media.

Other speakers will include Secretary of State \textbf{Mike Pompeo};
**** former Attorney General \textbf{Pam Bondi} of Florida; **** and
Gov. \textbf{Kim Reynolds} of Iowa. Mr. Pompeo's appearance in
particular has been criticized as outside the political bounds of a
cabinet figure whose post is often associated with apolitical diplomacy.

speeches?}\label{a-television-feel-or-rally-speeches}}

The stark contrast in tone and message between the Democrats and
Republicans was not the only thing on display Monday; there was also
their different approaches to hosting a convention that has been upended
by the coronavirus outbreak. While Democrats leaned in fully to the
television format, having actresses serve as the evening's moderators
and producing several slick videos to thread between speeches, the first
night of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-convention-election}{Republican
convention} had the feel of one of Mr. Trump's signature rallies ---
just with no live audience. Rather than taped remarks, almost all
Republicans gave live speeches in Washington, D.C. There was less
pre-preduction besides a video narrated by the actor Jon Voight, which
was repeated twice in the first night's broadcast.

During one segment, Mr. Trump seemed to take a play from the Democratic
convention a week prior, holding round tables with Americans who had
been affected by the coronavirus and another with former hostages and
detainees freed by Mr. Trump's administration. Except, while the
Democrats' listening sessions with Mr. Biden were highly choreographed
and conducted virtually, Mr. Trump's was freewheeling and in person.
Conservatives have bragged on holding more live speeches, saying they
believe it will give Americans a more authentic experience. It could be,
however, that they are trying to hold on to a format that doesn't
translate as well to the small screen.

\hypertarget{does-wisconsin-come-up}{%
\subsection{Does Wisconsin come up?}\label{does-wisconsin-come-up}}

Republicans have tried to pitch the protests about Black Lives Matter
and police brutality against Democrats, casting protesters as violent
actors seeking to destroy America. In the past 24 hours, they have added
a new talking point: the fires and destruction that took place in
Kenosha, Wis., after police officers were captured on camera shooting a
Black man named Jacob Blake multiple times in the back.

On the first night of the convention, Republicans falsely said that Mr.
Biden wanted to defund police departments and that he encouraged rioters
actions throughout the country. Republicans could refresh that argument
with the shooting of Mr. Blake and try to force Mr. Biden into a corner
between his progressive flank that wants him to embrace systemic
policing reform and moderates that want him to avoid it.

In previous instances, Mr. Biden has shrugged off these attempts at
driving a wedge. The Biden campaign has repeatedly said he does not
support police abolition or defunding police departments. He has
expressed sympathy for Black victims of police violence and said
officers should be held accountable.
