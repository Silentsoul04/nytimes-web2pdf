The panther has been Cartier's leitmotif for more than a century. The
first time the Paris-based jewelry company, founded in 1847, alluded to
the graceful jungle cat was in 1914, when the house created a women's
platinum wristwatch with a case that resembled an abstracted version of
the elegant animal's spots, in onyx and diamonds. In the decades that
followed, the house, led by creative director
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/t-magazine/cartier-mauna-necklace.html}{Jeanne
Toussaint}, interpreted the panther in increasingly figurative ways,
culminating in the three-dimensional brooches and bracelet made for the
Duchess of Windsor in the late 1940s and '50s, in which the animal's
emerald or diamond eyes seemed to glow.

Now, in an era when jewels tend to suggest the natural world in a more
metaphoric way, Cartier has returned the panther to its conceptual
beginnings. You can imagine this collar --- with its cascade of large
translucent and iridescent opals reflecting violet, cobalt and gray
hues, capped with a purplish-pink kunzite of more than 70 carats --- as
the shimmering, dappled coat of the cat as she darts through a glade. Or
perhaps the array of gems are the river stones she treads lightly upon
to elude those who might pursue her. \emph{Cartier {[}Sur{]}Naturel High
Jewelry Hemis necklace, price on request, (800) 227-8437.}
