One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned covering the daily information
wars of the Trump era is that a meaningful percentage of Americans [live
in an alternate
reality](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/2017-year-the-internet-destroyed-shared-reality)
powered by a completely separate universe of news and information.

Some are armed with their own completely fabricated facts about the
world while others, as the journalist Joshua Green [wrote in this
section
in 2017](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/15/opinion/sunday/no-one-cares-about-russia-in-the-world-breitbart-made.html),
rearrange our shared facts “to compose an entirely different narrative.”
There is little consensus on the top story of the day or the major
threats facing the country. You will have noticed this if you’ve ever
watched a congressional hearing and flipped between CNN or MSNBC and Fox
News. The video feed is the same but the [interpretation of
events](https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/872848804977836033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E872848804977836033%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeednews.com%2Farticle%2Fcharliewarzel%2F2017-year-the-internet-destroyed-shared-reality)
is radically different.

Personally, I’ve never seen a clearer demonstration of the Two Universes
phenomenon than this week’s [Republican National
Convention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-convention-election).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For three nights, in a shameless display of loyalty to President Trump,
the party has conjured up what my colleague [Frank Bruni described
as](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/opinion/trump-melania-rnc.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage)
an “upside-down vision” of the world. Theirs is a universe in which the
coronavirus pandemic is largely in the rear view (on Aug. 25, 1,136
Americans died from the virus) and where, according to Representative
Matt Gaetz, radical Democrats threaten to “disarm you, empty the
prisons, lock you in your home and invite MS-13 to live next door.” A
universe where the existential dangers of climate change pale in
comparison to those of cancel culture — even as the [West is ravaged by
blackouts and
wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/opinion/california-wildfires-blackouts.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage)
and the Gulf Coast is slammed by a [devastating
hurricane](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/hurricane-laura-update.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

This week, my colleague [Jamelle Bouie
described](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/opinion/trump-convention-platform.html)
some of what we’re seeing as the “Fox Newsification of the Republicans”
by “a president who rose to political power via the cable news channel
and who exists in a codependent relationship with the network.”

The comparison is apt, as Fox News has been extremely successful in
crafting and selling an alternate reality to its viewers each night for
well over a decade. The trick is to evoke two dueling emotions — fear
and devotion — one conspiracy theory at a time. Fox News has mastered
this and so has the R.N.C.

It’s why the convention paraded out Patricia McCloskey — one half of the
St. Louis couple who went viral for wielding guns at Black Lives Matter
protesters. Her message was designed to provoke feelings of victimhood
and racial fear.

“What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you who
are watching from quiet neighborhoods around our country,” she said.
“Make no mistake: No matter where you live, your family will not be
safe in the radical Democrats’ America.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That threat is far more potent when it’s paired with a second alternate
reality: that Donald Trump is the one and only competent protector, the
“bodyguard of Western civilization,” as the R.N.C. speaker Charlie
Kirk put it on Monday evening.

The power of a conspiracy theory is to offer an easy explanation for
something uncomfortable, which is why conspiracy theories thrive during
times of alienation or social change. But while one conspiracy theory
can be dangerous on its own, it is not a worldview. It’s when you stitch
enough of them together that an alternate reality forms.

This same convergence phenomenon is also behind the alarming growth of
the QAnon movement, which now acts as a big tent for conspiracies —
actively courting and [absorbing other fringe
theories](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7gz53/the-conspiracy-singularity-has-arrived)
into its sprawling narrative. Adrian Hon, a developer who designs
alternate reality games, [told me
recently](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/opinion/qanon-conspiracy-theory-arg.html)
that QAnon’s dynamics remind him of the worlds he’s helped create,
calling it “a collaborative fiction built on wild speculation that
hardens into reality.”

My colleague Paul Krugman [recently pointed out
similarities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/opinion/trump-qanon-convention.html)
between the conspiracy movement and Mr. Trump’s campaign effort, though
he doesn’t think the “desperate strategy” will work.

Having reported on the pull of these alternate realities up close, I
don’t feel certain about any outcome anymore. It’s hard to see things
clearly or make predictions in such a fractured information ecosystem.
And as The Times contributor [Thomas Edsall
notes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/opinion/trump-republican-convention-racism.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage),
we’ll be stuck here for a while — Mr. Trump’s rhetorical strategy “will
have long term consequences for the Republican Party.”

If you’d like more analysis on how that strategy played out in Night 3
of the R.N.C., my colleagues offer their views on [the highs and lows
here](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/opinion/rnc-best-worst-night-3.html).
My only prediction is that, no matter the outcome in November, I doubt
we’ll be returning to shared reality anytime soon.
