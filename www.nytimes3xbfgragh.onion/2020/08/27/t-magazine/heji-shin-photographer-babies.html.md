# The Photographer Capturing Unvarnished Truths

</div>

Heji Shin’s striking, discomfiting work poses an important question for
the contemporary age: What do we expect art to do, and does the artist
have a responsibility to do it?

“WE PUT A kind of call out for cocks. And they brought them. They’re
beautiful. I mean, they’re extremely, extremely beautiful,” says the
photographer Heji Shin in the midst of her latest shoot, her first since
the Covid-19 lockdown: large-format studio portraits — “very sharp, very
shiny” — of bellicose roosters. Two prints from the series, titled “[Big
Cocks](http://www.artnet.com/artists/heji-shin/big-cock-2-a-1yMY-WIAcK_wvpQ6kVrIHQ2),”
recently appeared in a group show at Galerie Buchholz in Berlin.
Roosters have long been associated with masculinity (though, in fact,
they don’t have penises, Shin informs me); in an era in which violence
tends to be systemic or “tactical,” she writes to me later, “the
short-lived outbursts of angry cock energy look Hellenistic and virile.”

Shin is accustomed to unwieldy subjects, having shot everything from
models having sex (for a discreetly pixelated spring 2017 campaign for
the fashion label Eckhaus Latta) to newborns emerging bloodily into the
world (“Baby,” 2016-17). Her trickiest subject to date was probably
[Kanye
West](https://www.galeriebuchholz.de/exhibitions/heji-shin-berlin-2019/),
whom Shin captured on a trip with his family and entourage to Uganda and
— briefly — in a Los Angeles studio (“Kanye,” 2018). Uncomfortable
taking direction from her, he posed looking directly into the camera.
Portrait photography always involves things outside the artist’s control
— ruffled feathers, awkward angles, megalomaniacal personalities — but
the South Korea-born German photographer is unflustered by difficulty.
In fact, ideas that seem improbable or even unachievable excite her, and
this is surely what makes her work stand out at a time in which images
have never felt more fleetingly disposable and yet freighted with
meaning. As eye-catching as they are unsettling, Shin’s photos offer a
dose of style, levity and provocation at a particularly earnest moment
in the arts, in which conversations about the ethics of representation
are dominant and the social utility of art is emphasized.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ever since the fall of 2016, there’s been an expectation, unspoken and
not, that art comments on the political moment — an expectation that
applies particularly to photography. Cameras, usually camera phones,
have become a citizen’s best weapon, a powerful and essential form of
defense; they’ve become necessary in the fight for equality, a way of
documenting everything from murderous police to bigoted dog walkers — a
way of holding individuals, and a racist society, accountable. But as
Shin sees it, art-making has always been a kind of power grab. “You are
making a claim that something is art, and this differentiation is, of
course, like creating a sort of hierarchy. You cannot circumvent that.
It’s not a democratic process,” she says. Case in point: the
pearl-clutching with which her “Baby” series was initially greeted. “Are
you kidding?” one (female) art adviser asked Shin when she saw them. Was
she seriously putting this out into the world as art? Interestingly,
Shin says that men tended to respond more positively to the images,
seeing in them a kind of analogy for the creative process.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s impossible to look at the series without wondering how she managed
to pull it off. Shin worked with a midwife to secure permission from the
mothers, who received a set of more conventional photos documenting the
birth in exchange for allowing Shin in the room. The focus is on the
babies’ aggrieved and rumpled faces; the idea, Shin tells me, came from
the German painter [Ull
Hohn](https://www.frieze.com/article/still-lives)’s unsettling, blurred
paintings of creature-like infant bodies from the early 1990s. At first,
Shin wasn’t sure she could show them. “I looked at them and I was like,
‘This is literally “The Exorcist.”’” Her retoucher started to cry.
(Newborns, Shin notes, look completely different only seconds later,
after they’ve drawn a few breaths.) She seems relieved when I tell her
that, as someone with a little bit of experience — having given birth
(traumatically, after being overdosed with Pitocin) — I find the
pictures extraordinary, and not a little refreshing. Outside of medical
contexts, babies tend to be photographed sentimentally, but Shin spares
us none of the violent intensity of bringing about life and of being
alive. To have a child is a risk, to make art is a risk — and Shin’s
images simultaneously showcase the fragility of the human animal and the
ferocity of its will. “I really do believe that we all have a
cherry-picking view on what nature is, like it’s a beautiful landscape
that we experience on a road trip,” she says. Her work is a repudiation
of that romance, a reminder that nature can be brutal, even monstrous,
and that we are ultimately at its mercy, much as we tend to believe the
reverse to be true.

WE’RE SPEAKING — UNNATURALLY — via Skype, my hopes of meeting her in a
more organic context dashed by quarantine; she’s in her apartment in New
York’s Chinatown while I’m 700 miles away, in Chicago. It is May. But
any framing device has a way of making certain details pre-eminent: Shin
is wearing a zebra-patterned intarsia sweater that I immediately covet;
the tail of a vintage Felix the Cat clock behind her swings in and out
of the frame metronomically; her sleek hair has a cheekbone-grazing
layer, which is striking at a moment in which most of us are still at
home in athleisure wear with straggles and visible roots. Unable to
travel, she’s spent a great deal of her time in lockdown perusing the
news, as we all have, although Shin reads not only things like The
Intercept and The Guardian but also Breitbart and RT, the Russian
state-controlled network, as well as various Hong Kong news outlets.
“Art seems a little bit impotent now,” she concedes.

I get the impression that Shin is motivated to read these ideologically
divergent publications not only for a fuller picture of global politics
but out of a very specific kind of curiosity, one felt by a very
specific kind of artist. The assumptions we bring to seeing the world —
our bubblelike frames of reference — interest Shin, the way we seem to
form our spheres of belief to protect ourselves from things we might not
want to see or know. Hence the surprise, of some, at the results of the
2016 election. Hence the astonishment, of others, at the chillingly
offhand extinguishing of [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html)’s
life under the knee of a Minneapolis policeman, captured on a cellphone
by a teenage girl. Our understanding of how power works is shaped by a
checklist of demographic factors, from where and when we were born to
what skin we were born into.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Similarly, we each bring a set of assumptions, a personal frame of
reference, to how we perceive art. At one point, Shin turns the question
on her interlocutor: “Do you think artists should be aware of the
political circumstances they make art in and have to actually make it
part of their art practice?” she asks, an onion of a question that
points to what Shin sees as a kind of dogmatic turn in art, an
expectation to convey appropriate liberal politics. Sensitivities are
running high in the art world: Think of the uproar that met Jordan
Wolfson’s ultraviolent virtual-reality film from 2017, “[Real
Violence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/04/28/arts/design/art-goes-political-but-will-that-fly-on-the-london-market.html),”
in which the artist, with the help of an animatronic dummy and C.G.I.,
appears to beat a passive victim to death with a baseball bat — all too
nauseatingly on the nose for some, given the excess of white-male rage
in Trump’s America — or the widespread controversy surrounding Dana
Schutz’s 2016 painting of Emmett Till, “[Open
Casket](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/21/arts/design/painting-of-emmett-till-at-whitney-biennial-draws-protests.html).”
The ambiguity of perspective and lack of context were, in both cases,
seen to be problematic by many critics. (Schutz’s painting in particular
has been seen as an unthought-through act of appropriation by a white
artist of a painful, historic image in a time of ongoing brutality
against Black bodies.) I think that these discussions are not only
important but essential to have, and Shin does not disagree. But she
also sees the way in which the fear of causing offense could lead to
work that is politically and aesthetically overdetermined. This isn’t a
matter of outright censorship but rather of public opinion, she says,
something that’s potentially internalized.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In talking to her, I keep thinking of something Janet Malcolm wrote in
her 1994 book on Sylvia Plath, “[The Silent
Woman](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1994/03/27/books/the-importance-of-being-biased.html)”:
“Art is theft, art is armed robbery, art is not pleasing your mother.”
Art, in other words, isn’t about being nice. Shin isn’t willing to cater
to public notions of acceptability or spare us our own discomfort. The
reactions to her work tend to be very strong and not always
straightforward. And so it makes a certain sense that her “Kanye”
portraits are perhaps her most controversial works to date; those
bright, oversize images, evocative of Warhol silk screens, have a sly
grandiosity. The series of 11 photos includes a single candid of him on
a safari with his young daughter North on his shoulders: West the
vacationing dad versus West the cultural projection. When Shin submitted
the work to the [2019 Whitney
Biennial](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/16/arts/design/whitney-biennial-review.html),
the curators were displeased. At the time, West was an outspoken Donald
Trump supporter; he had made an incendiary statement about slavery being
a choice for African-Americans, for which he later apologized. “They
said he would be too dominant,” Shin explains, as a big American
entertainment-industry figure. “I mean, it was like, yeah, but an
exhibition is not democracy. One even told me that it would exploit his
mental illness. There were these absurd discussions, and it went on for
weeks.” After some back and forth, they made a compromise — they would
show two of the “Kanye” portraits if Shin would also include five images
from the “Baby” series. (A Whitney spokesperson said that the curators
had invited Shin to participate based on the “Baby” series and had
selected those images from the beginning.) But in an 11th-hour twist,
the curators displayed the “Kanye” prints in the basement, between the
restrooms and the coat check. (The babies were displayed prominently on
the fifth floor.) Shin was unperturbed, even delighted, by the Kanye
portraits’ unusual placement. “I thought it was funny because everybody
would see it and also wonder why, and then it’s like the basement is the
area for repressed content.”

Art has always served as a playground for the cultural subconscious;
it’s what keeps us coming back to look again and again. Just wait, I
think, till Shin gets ahold of [Steve
Bannon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/nyregion/steve-bannon-arrested-indicted.html),
our American grotesque, who is one of the figures she names when I ask
her whom she’d like to photograph next. Jane Goodall, so often pictured
with a maternal, almost Madonna-like incandescence, holding a chimp, is
another. (Shin has a thing for animals as amusing objects of human
psychological projection; in 2016, she made
“[\#LonelyGirl,](https://www.galeriebernhard.com/exhibitions/heji-shin-lonelygirl)”
a series of portraits using a monkey to mock the selfie vernacular; one
of them, in which the monkey is nibbling on a dildo, landed on the cover
of Artforum in May 2016.) “To create is always a step into the unknown,”
she says. “Everything has to submit to art. Everything. When you’re an
artist, you have to submit politics to your art. Not the other way
around. You have to submit your own emotions, your anxieties, your
ideologies. That’s why art is this really kind of sacred thing. And to
do it the other way around always compromises certain things, right?”

At the end of the day, I’m skeptical that politics can ever entirely
submit to art, and I’m not convinced that it ever did; perhaps we’re
just more conscious of differentials in power than we once were. We can
all point to moments in the history of photography in which
transgression became exploitation: Think of Robert Mapplethorpe’s
’80s-era nudes of Black men, who were often depersonalized or posed to
embody (and perhaps mock) racial stereotypes. Shin mentions Irina
Ionesco, the French photographer who built her career in the 1970s by
taking erotic portraits of her prepubescent daughter, Eva; in 2015, Eva
successfully sued her mother for damages and prevented her from further
disseminating the images without Eva’s consent. “Doing something simply
out of a desire to be transgressive is very stupid,” says Shin, “you
know, just to break certain taboos. It has to have more substance than
that, I think.”

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If Shin is here to remind us of the sense of adventure to be found in
art, she also reminds us of the risk — a moral risk, but most of all,
the risk of artistic failure. “People react very intuitively to what
risk is, and then you get excited when they react either in a negative
way or in a positive way, it doesn’t matter, with their amygdala,” she
says. “You know, you don’t react with your rational side. That’s where
it should go.” That Shin’s work is drawing attention in a larger moment
of outrage against a host of social ills doesn’t feel coincidental;
looking at it tends to provoke reconsideration of the relevancy of art
in this charged moment. Where is the risk in politically didactic art
when it is posted on Instagram like a kind of virtuous trading card? How
high are the stakes, really, when everyone who follows you agrees? Who
and what, exactly, constitutes “public opinion,” and at what point does
sensitivity tip over into pandering?

IN CONTEMPORARY PORTRAIT photography, it has often fallen to women to
show us the potential of the form to subvert conventions and redirect
the gaze, from Cindy Sherman’s stereotype-mocking self-portraits to
[Carrie Mae
Weems](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/t-magazine/carrie-mae-weems-moma-garden.html)
staring down the camera in her “Kitchen Table Series,” filling decades
of absence in representation with a demand to be seen. It’s difficult
now to imagine the world would see AIDS in quite the same way without
Nan Goldin, or the queer community without Catherine Opie. Such
photography implicitly critiques absences in art history while imbuing
the camera’s subject with dignity, as in Deana Lawson’s goddess-like
nudes in their living rooms, or (arguably) Diane Arbus’s sideshow
performers and sex workers. (Arbus, unsurprisingly, is a touchstone for
Shin.) Women have dominated contemporary portraiture for good reason:
There’s tremendous power to be found in moving the margins to the
center. “Portraiture is always very psychological, and it has a huge
palette of references,” says Shin, who began her career as a
photographer shooting portraits for a German economics magazine in the
early aughts. “And it always works. I’m always surprised that it works,
but it does. There’s an impact we inherently recognize and react to.”

Shin came to photography late, she says, after receiving a camera for
her 20th birthday. She attended art school in Hamburg before dropping
out and moving to Berlin. It was the late 1990s, and the art scene
hadn’t really arrived in Germany’s newly reunified capital just yet —
the city was, at that point, a symbol as much as it was a geographic
place — but there was a robust music scene, largely techno, and there
were a lot of clubs and house parties. “Back then, Berlin was so cool,”
she recalls. “But people weren’t even aware that it was cool at that
time. We lived in very chic apartments that were huge and cost nothing.
They all still had a coal oven.” She aspired to have an editorial career
in fashion, but her art career took off first (she has also published
work in Pop Magazine, CR Fashion Book and Purple, with shoots that blur
the line between the artistic and commercial), and for a few years, she
was back and forth between Berlin and New York with her husband, the
Canadian artist Mathieu Malouf, whom she met in Berlin in 2008, before
settling more permanently in New York.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Shin can be seen as an heir of the German photographers who also made
their name shooting editorial work for magazines, including Juergen
Teller, Wolfgang Tillmans and Helmut Newton (she especially admires
Newton); she seems unconcerned that anyone might find this blurring of
the line between commerce and art glib. I reminisce with Shin about
being a teenager in the late 1980s and early 1990s — we’re both
Generation X’ers in our 40s — reading magazines like The Face, i-D and
Visionaire, and it occurs to me that she’s never lost the barbed
irreverence of that time. It was then that a sense of culture
alternative to the popular and mainstream took hold, and Shin brings
something of that era’s ironic sensibility and critique of the status
quo to this one. The early 1990s — 1993, to be precise — also witnessed
one of the most controversial [Whitney
Biennials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/07/05/arts/design/whitney-biennial-maps.html),
when queer, feminist and nonwhite artists who had been shut out from the
institution finally began making their mark in the mainstream with work
that was provocative and discomfiting. “I Can’t Imagine Ever Wanting to
Be White,” read one of the admission buttons designed by Daniel Joseph
Martinez. George Holliday’s video of the Rodney King beating was
screened on the museum walls. Janine Antoni nibbled on 600-pound cubes
of chocolate and lard. The purpose of art and who gets to make it was,
quite explicitly, a theme. Surely one reason that art subsequently
became so much about self-assertion and identity was in response to what
had for so long been a white monopoly on the
culture.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

We’re nostalgic for the early 1990s, Shin says, for good reason. “It was
the last time we really demonstrated an identity of what \[the\] times
were,” she says. It was before fashion became a riff or remix of
everything that had come before. Since the internet age, with its new
digital platforms, visual culture has accelerated to a degree that makes
it difficult to pin down; the curation of taste once found in print has
gone online, becoming more individualized; anyone can cultivate a
following on TikTok or Instagram. But Shin believes there is something
more regressive afoot and wants to “dig deeper why things cannot
culturally be just expressed. Like why this freedom has disappeared. For
example, why millennials are a certain way, or they don’t like certain
kinds of liberties anymore.”

Shin’s teen years may have been a heyday for fashion photography, but
this period was also notorious for its embarrassing cultural
appropriations — think of any number of fashion layouts from the 1980s
and early 1990s starring a lanky white, blond model in Asia or Africa,
dressed in designer fashion featuring motifs swiped from traditional
clothing. To contemporary eyes, this sort of thing provokes a tremendous
cringe, but it wasn’t long ago that this was a fashion magazine
standard. These days, crimes of appropriation tend to be called out, but
they’re not always as straightforwardly offensive or obvious as a
Victoria’s Secret model in a feather headdress, and they extend well
beyond the realms of fashion and photography to white chefs writing
about healthy soul food, a novelist unconvincingly ventriloquizing a
Mexican migration experience or a company or arts institution with nary
a person of color in a position of power on staff celebrating Black
creativity.

One side effect of this long history of white plundering of other
cultures is a kind of defensive politics in which everyone is expected
to speak only from their personal ethnic experiences, as though cultural
identity is a form of intellectual property. While understandable, this
too can be problematic in the assumptions it makes: Our identities
aren’t always seamlessly pure or reducible. Shin clearly wants to
stand apart from this kind of essentializing. A double immigrant, she
has entirely resisted making art about self-definition in a foreign
land, or that overtly addresses the condition of being an Asian woman
first in Germany and then in the United States. Given the explicit
nature of much of her work, it follows that making the pictures she
*does* make surely requires a certain amount of trust from her subjects.
And yet, intimacy is not what her images evoke; in fact, the opposite is
true. She finds it liberating, she says, to be an outsider, to exist
outside any given cultural framework.

IN ONE WAY or another, Shin has always been something of an initiated
outsider, someone who knows all the rules but feels little need to heed
them. She was born in Seoul, to Korean parents, but moved at 4 to
Hamburg with her mother, a nurse who emigrated during a nursing shortage
in Germany (her parents are divorced, and her father remained in South
Korea; she had a German stepfather). It occurs to me that Shin has now
been witnessing a culture — first in Germany, then in the United States
— in the process of painfully contending with its own historical
conscience for much of her life. When I ask her about the earliest
visual memory she can recall, she tells me that she spent much of her
early years, until she was about 10, in a residence for immigrant
children run by the Catholic church. “All of the imagery is so
fantastic,” she says. “I think children are always interested in the
same things — Jesus’s body, and of course Mother Maria, because she’s so
beautiful. People don’t understand anymore how influential and great it
is to be surrounded by that kind of imagery.”

All portraiture, of course, is a form of icon-making, whether it’s the
Virgin Mary or a pink-haired Kate Moss: a public face of our culture at
a moment in time. In 2018, Shin made a witty series of X-rays of herself
while holding a pug or a Chihuahua — one creepy skeleton holding
another, stripped of cuteness and intimacy: the “look at me”
transparency of the selfie taken to its logical (and absurdist)
consequence, the artist exposing herself down to the bones while
revealing nothing. But I also can’t help but think of the series as a
commentary on the expectation that female artists put themselves into
their work, baring their personal narratives, or even their own faces
and bodies, as indeed many photographers of her generation have done,
like Laurel Nakadate, who first became known for her eerie short films
in which she threw herself birthday parties or danced to Britney Spears
in the homes of strange men, or Elinor Carucci, who has documented
herself throughout different phases of her life, including pregnancy and
motherhood, her marital crisis, even her back pain. These skilled
practitioners of first-person photography are inviting us to look at
them, directing the gaze back onto themselves to elicit a certain potent
intimacy. Shin seems to want us not to look at her but at ourselves.

The question of exactly whose gaze is on display is at the center of her
2018 series “Men Photographing Men,” for which Shin staged a cop-themed
gay porn shoot in an art gallery and exhibited the resulting images in
the same space, making visitors feel as if they were wandering onto a
set. Immediately, we’re implicated in the looking: The absurdly
good-looking male models in police uniforms seem to be monitoring the
images of men having sex, and here we are as well, looking at all of it.
The pictures themselves, all cheekbones and bare bottoms and holsters,
are amusing, and the models — white, exuding vanity — seem to be in on
the joke. At face value, it’s transgressive in a playful way. Did she do
it just to prove that she, an Asian woman, another marginalized class,
could objectify white men as a man might, and poke fun at masculine
archetypes? Maybe. But what might be most radical about Shin’s work is
the way she puts us front and center in her project, making us aware of
ourselves as uneasy spectators, uncertain of our point of view. At the
opening, she tells me, one attendee, a Black acquaintance who didn’t
realize she had taken the pictures, told her that he thought the show
was awful. “Why do you think that?” she asked. “Who do you think took
them?” Some white dude, he replied. This doesn’t feel all that
surprising to me, given the show’s title, though I get her point. As we
question the flow of power (not to mention the symbolism of a police
uniform), we are all uncomfortably destabilized right now; those who
aren’t probably should be.

It seems right, then, that the art that is meaningful now isn’t the work
that makes us feel secure or elated in our righteousness but that makes
us question where we are in the grand scheme of things: art that dares
us to question our intentions with imagery that feels raw and vital and
sensibility-challenging. As Americans see their repressed content
emerging at street level, in the things we call out on Twitter and in
person en masse, across the country, the subtext of power has become
text at a remarkable speed. Everything is under scrutiny, including the
violence of silent acquiescence; no one can really be a bystander
anymore. What we call outsiderness, implying a dispassionate, unbiased
observer, was perhaps always more of a stance than an achievable
reality. But maybe, Shin would have us believe, there’s a way to get
past the limitations of our perspectives, to subvert our own framing
devices via art’s ability to estrange and transubstantiate. What we see
unfolding on the street will translate into disruptions and revolutions
in galleries, too, in art that is skeptical of a heartwarming or cleanly
unifying story. As we turn our camera on ourselves and each other, the
visuals on the street have outpaced the ones on the walls, leaving us to
ask how far it all will go and where we stand in the fray.
