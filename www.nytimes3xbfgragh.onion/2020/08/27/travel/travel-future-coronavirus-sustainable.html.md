# Move Over, Sustainable Travel. Regenerative Travel Has Arrived.

Can a post-vaccine return to travel be smarter and greener than it was
before March 2020? Some in the tourism industry are betting on it.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Tourism, which [grew faster](https://wttc.org/Research/Economic-Impact)
than the global gross domestic product for the past nine years, has been
decimated by the pandemic. Once accounting for 10 percent of employment
worldwide, the sector is poised to shed 121 million jobs, with losses
projected at a minimum of $3.4 trillion, according to the World Travel &
Tourism Council.

But in the lull, some in the tourism industry are planning for a
post-vaccine return to travel that’s better than it was before March
2020 — greener, smarter and less crowded. If sustainable tourism, which
aims to counterbalance the social and environmental impacts associated
with travel, was the aspirational outer limit of ecotourism before the
pandemic, the new frontier is “regenerative travel,” or leaving a place
better than you found it.

“Sustainable tourism is sort of a low bar. At the end of the day, it’s
just not making a mess of the place,” said Jonathon Day, an associate
professor focused on sustainable tourism at Purdue University.
“Regenerative tourism says, let’s make it better for future
generations.”

## Defining regeneration

Regenerative travel has its roots in regenerative development and
design, which includes buildings that meet the U.S. Green Building
Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design or
[LEED](https://www.usgbc.org/help/what-leed) standards. The concept has
applications across many fields, including regenerative agriculture,
which aims to restore soils and sequester carbon.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Generally, sustainability, as practiced today, is about slowing down
the degradation,” said Bill Reed, an architect and principal of
Regenesis Group, a design firm based in Massachusetts and New Mexico
that has been practicing regenerative design, including tourism
projects, since 1995. He described efforts like fuel efficiency and
reduced energy use as “a slower way to die.”

“Regeneration is about restoring and then regenerating the capability to
live in a new relationship in an ongoing way,” he added.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With most travel suspended during the pandemic, regenerative travel
remains at the starting gate. But in the lull, it’s the new buzz. Six
nonprofit organizations, including the [Center for Responsible
Travel](https://www.responsibletravel.org/) and [Sustainable Travel
International](https://sustainabletravel.org/), have joined together as
the [Future of Tourism](https://www.futureoftourism.org/) coalition,
which aims to “build a better tomorrow.”

Twenty-two travel groups, including tour operators like [G
Adventures](https://www.gadventures.com/), destination marketers such as
the Slovenian Tourist Board, and organizations like the [Adventure
Travel Trade Association](https://www.adventuretravel.biz/), have signed
on to the coalition’s 13 guiding principles, including “demand fair
income distribution” and “choose quality over quantity.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[Tourism New Zealand,](https://www.tourismnewzealand.com/) the country’s
tourism organization, is talking about measuring its success not solely
in economic terms, but against the well-being of the country,
considering nature, human health and community identities. And travel
leaders in Hawaii are discussing repositioning the state as a cultural
destination in hopes of re-engaging islanders, many of whom are fed up
with overtourism, in the vitality of tourism.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To flesh out these broad strokes, Mr. Day, the associate professor,
points to the concept of a circular economy, which aims to design waste
out of the system, keep materials in use through reuse, repair and
upcycling, and regenerate natural systems.

“Tourism is just at the beginning of this process of how we can apply
circular economy ideas to the system,” he said.

Regenesis worked on the development of [Playa
Viva](https://www.playaviva.com/), a small resort south of Zihuatanejo,
Mexico, on the Pacific Coast, which opened in 2009. The firm’s
assessment of the more than 200-acre property took in the beaches, the
bird-filled estuary and ancient ruins as well as the problems of turtle
poaching and poor schools in the village. Ultimately, the small town of
Juluchuca became the gateway to the property; an organic agricultural
system benefited both the property and local residents; and a 2 percent
fee added to any stay funds a trust that invests in community
development.

“Rather than a resort helicoptering in and taking up land, they said,
‘We are the village,’” Mr. Reed said. “It’s a paradigm shift.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

Playa Viva is one of 45 resorts belonging to [Regenerative
Travel](https://www.regenerativetravel.com/about/), a booking agency
that vets members based on metrics such as carbon usage, employee
well-being, immersive guest activities and sourcing local food. To date,
qualifications for membership have been handled internally, but in
September the company plans to launch a benchmarking system to
demonstrate their regenerative progress.

[OneSeed Expeditions](https://www.oneseedexpeditions.com/), an adventure
tour operator based in Denver, aims to couple travel with economic
development. It uses 10 percent of its proceeds to provide zero-interest
loans to local nongovernmental organizations where it operates in places
like Nepal and Peru. The local groups then issue microloans to community
entrepreneurs in businesses such as farming and retail.

“The areas of greatest need are not necessarily in areas of the greatest
tourism attractions,” said Chris Baker, the founder of OneSeed
Expeditions. “We want to use tourism to be able to benefit people
outside of those areas.”

Regenerative tourism addresses impacts holistically, from destination
and community perspectives as well as environmental. [Intrepid
Travel](https://www.intrepidtravel.com/us), the small-group tour company
that, until the pandemic, ran more than 1,000 itineraries globally, has
been carbon neutral since 2010. This year it extended its pledge to
cover 125 percent of its carbon emissions.

“There’s this notion that business success means you have to do harm to
the world,” said James Thornton, the chief executive of Intrepid Travel,
which became a B Corporation, an entity dedicated to benefiting workers,
customers, the community and environment, as well as shareholders, in
2018. “When the new normality returns, it shouldn’t come at the expense
of
sustainability.”

## Correcting overtourism

Implicit in many discussions about regenerative tourism is the threat of
returning to overtourism, which accounted for excessive numbers of
visitors in places like
[Dubrovnik](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/19/world/europe/dubrovnik-croatia-game-of-thrones.html)
that ultimately had to cap the number of cruise ships allowed to dock
daily in high season.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“For so long, tourism success was defined by growing the numbers —
numbers of visitors, numbers of cruise passengers,” said Gregory Miller,
the executive director of the Center for Responsible Travel, a nonprofit
group that advocates for sustainable travel. “Even before the pandemic,
there was a need for
rebalancing.”

For example, the current recession may have bought Hawaii a few years

Head at sunrise. In a 2018

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

“We have the curse of a strong brand,” said Frank Haas, a former vice
president with the Hawaiian Tourism Authority and an independent tourism
consultant. “We’re so well known as a sun destination that people
overlook the other aspects, the Hawaiian culture, the royal past, the
interesting geological and natural attractions.”

He thinks it will require more coordinated management — currently, a
variety of federal, state and local authorities regulate parks and
facilities like airports — as well as creative entrepreneurs to expand
cultural tourism by appealing to travelers interested in food, art,
history or music.

## Who defines ‘better’ tourism?

Determining what makes a place better and who makes that decision
requires local involvement, according to regenerative tourism
proponents.

[VisitFlanders,](https://www.visitflanders.com/en/?country=en_US) the
tourism organization representing the Northern Belgium region, used
local input to rethink its mission, repositioning its stance from
growing travel for the sake of the economy to creating an “economy of
meaning,” according to its master
[plan](https://www.reizennaarmorgen.be/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/memorandum-eng.pdf).
That includes, among other initiatives, linking visitors with locals who
share their passions for things like history or food and making
storytelling central to sites like its World War I battlefields.

“We’ve managed to shift the thinking from having their primary objective
be about growing the numbers, to creating flourishing destinations,
flourishing communities and having them say what kind of tourism they
want,” said Anna Pollock, the founder of [Conscious
Travel](http://www.conscious.travel/), an education and consulting
enterprise devoted to positioning travel as a force for good, who worked
with VisitFlanders.

## A traveler’s role in regeneration

Ms. Pollock believes regenerative travel is a supply-side concept that
asks operators to do more for the environment and community than they
take from them. But travelers play a key role in demand.

“Become mindful of the fact that your trip is going to have a set of
costs associated with it, which needs to be paid by somebody,” she said.
“In the same way you think, ‘Should I buy that cheap T-shirt from the
dime store down the road?,’ knowing it’s created by semi-slave labor.
Now you’re thinking consciously about who do I buy it from and is it
quality.”

The experience of the pandemic — when many are discovering the power of
their pocketbooks in supporting local businesses like bookstores and
restaurants — is, perhaps, the most instructive in demonstrating
sustainability, even if the travel involved is within a few blocks of
home.

“Travel is an important vote of your principles,” said Mr. Baker of
OneSeed. “When you decide to put your time and resources into a trip,
you’re affirming that’s the type of business you want out there.”

Sustainable travel, let alone regenerative travel, will still have to
find solutions to the carbon emissions produced by air travel. Until the
economy recovers, there’s likely to be less travel, more local travel,
or slower travel by car, train, bike or foot. This moment of reflection,
say proponents, is where regeneration begins.

“It’s about how to regenerate our relationship with life,” said Mr.
Reed, the architect. “That’s a continual process. Our children will need
that taught to them. Regeneration is a continual cycle of rebirth.
That’s how we sustain the planet. You cannot have a sustainable planet
without regeneration.”
