Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the nation's top elected Democrat, said on
Thursday that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should not
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/business/media/trump-biden-debate-moderators.html}{debate
President Trump}, telling reporters that she believed her party's
nominee should not ``dignify that conversation with Donald Trump.''

``I wouldn't legitimize a conversation with him, nor a debate,'' Ms.
Pelosi said at her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill. She
acknowledged that the Biden campaign felt differently, but said she
considered Mr. Trump's behavior during the 2016 debates against Hillary
Clinton ``disgraceful.''

``I think that he'll probably act in a way that is beneath the dignity
of the presidency ---~he does that every day,'' she said. ``I think he
will also belittle what the debates are supposed to be about. They're
not to be about skulduggery on the part of somebody who has no respect
for the office he holds, much less the democratic process.''

Mr. Biden said on Thursday that not only would he debate Mr. Trump, he
would fact-check him. ``I'm going to be a fact-checker on the floor
while I'm debating him,'' Mr. Biden told MSNBC, adding that the
president had a ``somewhat pathological tendency not to tell the
truth.''

Republicans have pushed to add a fourth debate, suggesting that Mr.
Biden, who is 77 and prone to gaffes, could embarrass himself in an
unscripted format.

They quickly seized Ms. Pelosi's comment as evidence that leading
Democrats, in the words of the Students for Trump leader Ryan Fournier,
``don't want Biden in front of a camera because they know Trump would
wipe the floor with him.''

Earlier in the news conference, Ms. Pelosi also implied that House
Democrats would continue to pursue Mr. Trump's elusive tax returns,
which he has refused to release in defiance of decades-long norms, even
if he loses in November.

She made the comments during an endorsement of Representative Richard E.
Neal of Massachusetts, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who is
fighting for access to Mr. Trump's returns in the courts and faces a
primary challenge next week.

``When we win this election and we have a new president of the United
States in January and we have a new secretary of the Treasury, and
Richie Neal asks for the president's returns, then the world will see
what the president has been hiding all of this time,'' Ms. Pelosi said.
