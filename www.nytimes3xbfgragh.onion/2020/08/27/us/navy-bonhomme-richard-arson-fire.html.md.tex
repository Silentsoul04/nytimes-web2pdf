It took four days in July to extinguish the fire on the Bonhomme
Richard, which rendered the ship inoperative.

WASHINGTON --- Federal investigators have questioned a sailor for
suspected arson in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/naval-ship-fire-san-diego.html}{the
fire that engulfed the warship Bonhomme Richard} in July, according to a
senior Navy official.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have focused their investigation on one
sailor from that ship, said the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity to discuss some details of the continuing inquiry. No motive
has been identified, and no one has been charged, the official said.

The arson investigation was separately confirmed by a Defense Department
official who was not authorized to speak with reporters. The official
said the investigation was expected to be completed by the end of
September.

There were no fatalities from the fire, but 68 military and civilian
firefighters were treated for injuries including heat exhaustion and
smoke inhalation.

The fire that rendered the ship inoperative
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/12/us/naval-ship-fire-san-diego.html}{began
on July 12} while it was pierside at a Navy base in San Diego. More than
400 sailors from 16 nearby ships fought the blaze, which reached
temperatures of 1,000 degrees and took four days to extinguish.

The Pentagon declined to answer questions about the investigation, which
was
\href{https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/sources-sailor-possibly-linked-to-uss-bonhomme-richard-ship-fire-under-investigation}{first
reported by ABC 10 News} in San Diego.

``The Navy will not comment on an ongoing investigation to protect the
integrity of the investigative process and all those involved,'' said
Lt. Tim Pietrack, a Navy spokesman. ``We have nothing to announce at
this time.''

A spokeswoman for Naval Surface Force Pacific, which is leading the
investigation into the fire's cause, also declined to comment.

The fire that consumed the ship broke out on a Sunday morning, when
fewer than 200 sailors were on board, and spread rapidly. Initial
firefighting efforts were halted after an explosion inside the ship,
forcing the sailors to temporarily withdraw for safety reasons.

The Bonhomme Richard was undergoing a lengthy maintenance period at the
time, after years of being deployed in Japan. Navy officials have said
that the fire started in an area where Marines would typically park
trucks like Humvees while at sea, but that it might have been
temporarily filled with combustible materials as shipyard workers moved
items around.

Besides the criminal investigation, the Navy is looking into whether
proper safety precautions were being followed before the fire began.

An amphibious assault ship, the Bonhomme Richard is designed to carry
thousands of Marines and deploy them from landing craft and helicopters.
With an 800-foot flight deck, it can also launch and recover attack
aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

Although the ship's engines and propulsion systems were untouched by the
blaze, the rest of the vessel was largely gutted and the Navy's top
officer, Adm. Michael M. Gilday, has said that its future as a
commissioned warship is uncertain.
