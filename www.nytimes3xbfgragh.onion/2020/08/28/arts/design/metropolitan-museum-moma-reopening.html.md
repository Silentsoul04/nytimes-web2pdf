Before you head back to the Museum of Modern Art and [the Metropolitan
Museum of
Art](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/arts/design/met-museum-reopening.html),
there are some things you need to know: capacity will be limited to 25
percent, temperature checks and face masks will be mandatory, and the
advance purchase of tickets is required. Each museum has specific
guidelines, so you’ll want to visit their websites:
[moma.org](https://www.moma.org/) and
[metmuseum.org](https://www.metmuseum.org/). Our critics have reviewed
some of the new shows — “[Félix
Fénéon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/arts/design/moma-reopens-felix-feneon.html)”
at MoMA, and “[Making the
Met,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/arts/design/met-museum-reopens-anniversary.html)”
“[Jacob
Lawrence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/arts/design/jacob-lawrence-metropolitan-museum.html)”
and [Héctor Zamora’s rooftop
sculpture](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/arts/design/met-roof-hector-zamora-wall.html)
at the Met — but they also weighed in previously about several
exhibitions that are still on view. Below, you’ll find an overview of
those shows, as well as a partial listing of some of the museums opening
in the coming days. *NICOLE HERRINGTON*

## MoMA

*The museum is now open. MoMA PS1 remains closed, though it plans to
reopen Sept. 17 with the exhibition “Marking Time: Art in the Age of
Incarceration.”*

**‘JUDD’** (through Jan. 9) This retrospective of some 70 works by the
American artist Donald Judd is his first in New York in more than 30
years. It ranges from formally spare early abstract sculptures to the
high-color work done before his death in 1994. The show is a beautiful
thing: carefully winnowed, persuasively installed, just the right size.
Judd once said that for art to matter, “it needs only to be
interesting.” (Holland Cotter)

**‘DOROTHEA LANGE: WORDS & PICTURES’** (through Sept. 19) As this
revelatory, heartening exhibition shows, Lange was an artist who made
remarkable pictures throughout a career that covered more than four
decades. The photos she took in 1942 of interned Japanese-Americans
display state-administered cruelty with stone-cold clarity. Her
prescient photographs of environmental degradation portray the human
cost of building a dam. Her empathetic portraits of African-American
field hands shine a light on a system of peonage that predated and
outlasted the 1930s. (Arthur Lubow)

**THE COLLECTIONS** MoMA recently celebrated its latest expansion with
these inaugural shows, drawing from its collection. **“Sur Moderno:
Journeys of Abstraction — the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Gift”**
(through Sept. 12) presents a selection of South American postwar art so
substantial that it could reorient the museum’s focus. For **“The Shape
of Shape,”** the latest iteration of the museum’s Artist’s Choice
series, the painter Amy Sillman filled a large gallery with an
astounding array of carefully juxtaposed works from across the
collection (through Oct. 4). **“Taking a Thread for a Walk”** (through
Jan. 10) looks at the role of weaving in modern art beyond textiles. And
**“Private Lives Public Spaces”** (through Feb. 21), a video
installation in the galleries just outside the main movie auditoriums,
comprises 47 hours of neglected footage from the museum’s collection.

**‘SAHEL: ART AND EMPIRES ON THE SHORES OF THE SAHARA’** (through Oct.
26) Sahel was the name once given by traders crossing the oceanic Sahara
to the welcoming grasslands that marked the desert’s southern rim,
terrain that is now Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal. To early
travelers, art from the region must have looked like a rich but
bewildering hybrid. It still does, which may be one reason it stands, in
the West, somewhat outside an accepted “African” canon. This fabulous
[exhibition](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/sahel-art-empire-sahara)
goes for the richness. One look tells you that variety within variety,
difference talking to difference, is the story here. New ideas spring up
from local soil and arrive from afar. Ethnicities and ideologies collide
and embrace. Cultural influences get swapped, dropped and recouped in a
multitrack sequencing that is the very definition of history. (Holland
Cotter)

**‘THE GREAT HALL COMMISSION: KENT MONKMAN, MISTIKOSIWAK (WOODEN BOAT
PEOPLE)’** (through September) These two monumental paintings offer
narratives inspired by a Euro-American tradition of history painting but
are entirely present-tense and polemical in theme. Kent Monkman, a
Canadian artist of mixed Cree and Irish heritage, makes the colonial
violence done to North America’s first peoples his central subject but,
crucially, flips the cliché of Native American victimhood on its head.
Here, Indigenous peoples are immigrant-welcoming rescuers, led by the
heroic figure of Monkman’s alter ego, the gender-fluid tribal leader
Miss Chief Eagle Testickle, avatar of the global future that will see
humankind moving beyond the wars of identity — racial, sexual, political
— in which it is now fatefully immersed. (Holland Cotter)

**‘IN PURSUIT OF FASHION: THE SANDY SCHREIER COLLECTION’** (through
Sept. 27) Featuring 80 pieces of clothing and accessories, [this
exhibition](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/in-pursuit-of-fashion-the-sandy-schreier-collection)
is, more than anything else, the reflection of one woman’s love affair
with fashion. Schreier’s collection, and the part of it on view,
contains all the major names, but what defines it more than anything
else is her own appreciation for pretty things. Hidden away between the
Balenciagas and the Chanels, the Diors and the Adrians, are treasures by
little-known or even unknown designers that are a delight to discover.
It is these less famous names whose impact lingers, in part because they
are so unexpected. (Vanessa Friedman)

**‘ARTE DEL MAR: ARTISTIC EXCHANGE IN THE CARIBBEAN’** (through Jan.
10). This exhibition of art from the West Indies concentrates on the
ritual objects — thrones, vessels and mysterious bird-shaped stones — of
the Taíno people, who inhabited the islands now called Hispaniola,
Puerto Rico, Cuba and Turks and Caicos. On these islands, and on the
Caribbean-facing coasts of Central America, styles mingled and migrated,
and art had both religious and diplomatic functions; one extravagant
gold pendant here, in the shape of a bird with splayed wings and
zigzagging necklaces, traveled from Panama all the way to the Antilles.
