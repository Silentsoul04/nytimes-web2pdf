# Two P.R. Experts at F.D.A. Have Been Ousted After Blood Plasma Fiasco

The agency’s chief spokeswoman, Emily Miller, was removed from her
position just 11 days into the job. And the contract was terminated of a
consultant who had advised the F.D.A. chief to correct misleading claims
about plasma’s benefits.

The head of the Food and Drug Administration ousted its top spokeswoman
from her position on Friday in an urgent bid to restore the tarnished
credibility of the agency after he [made erroneous claims that
overstated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/health/fda-blood-plasma.html)
the benefits of plasma treatments for Covid-19 at a news conference with
President Trump.

The decision came just a day after the F.D.A.’s parent agency, the
Department of Health and Human Services, terminated the contract of a
public relations consultant who had advised the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr.
Stephen M. Hahn, to correct his misleading claims that 35 out of 100
Covid-19 patients “would have been saved because of the administration
of plasma.”

The removals come at a moment when the agency, which will be making
critical decisions about whether to approve coronavirus vaccines and
treatments, is struggling to salvage its reputation as a neutral
scientific arbiter.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The ousted spokeswoman, Emily Miller, had little experience in health
care. She had spent years working in Washington for Republicans,
including the former Texas Congressman Tom DeLay and Senator Ted Cruz of
Texas, and as a journalist for One America News, the conservative cable
network. She was in her agency post for just 11
days.

“This is a low moment for the F.D.A. in at least a generation,” Daniel
Carpenter, **** a professor at Harvard University who studies the
agency, said of Dr. Hahn’s failure to control the public message about
the plasma authorization. “This was a major self-inflicted wound.”

The most recent controversy over plasma follows a series of missteps by
the F.D.A. that have fueled concerns that the agency is losing the
public’s trust as the nation faces a presidential election in November
and a pandemic that has taken more than 180,000 American lives.

Also this week, the nation’s premier public health agency, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, [was accused of bowing to political
pressure](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-testing.html)
after it revised its testing guidelines to say people without symptoms
of the virus didn’t need to get tested.

Dr. Hahn has already been [criticized for a series of
worrisome](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/10/health/stephen-hahn-fda.html)
actions, including authorizing the emergency use of two malaria drugs
Mr. Trump had favored — a decision that was [later
revoked](https://www.fda.gov/media/138946/download) — and for having
allowed the sale of shoddy antibody tests early in the U.S. outbreak.

“The agency needs to work very hard to regain the trust of the American
people — there have been too many unforced errors,” said Dr. David A.
Kessler, who was F.D.A. commissioner under Presidents George Bush and
Clinton, and is advising Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign.
“It needs to focus on what it does best, which is to put the data in
front of the medical and scientific community and the American public,
and stick with the
data.”

Dr. Hahn notified senior leadership at the F.D.A. on Friday that Ms.
Miller would no longer be the official spokeswoman for the agency, and
that he would be appointing someone to replace her in an interim
capacity. Ms. Miller could not be reached for
comment.

The consultant who was removed by the health and human services
department, Wayne L. Pines, said he wasn’t told why his contract was
severed.

“I did recommend that he correct the record,” he said. “If a federal
official doesn’t say something right, and chooses to clarify and say
that the criticism is justified, that’s refreshing.”

The Department of Health and Human Services denied that Mr. Pines’s
contract was terminated because of his involvement in the plasma
messaging.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

It was “100 percent coincidence,” said Brian Harrison, the department’s
chief of staff. “H.H.S. has been reviewing and canceling similar
contracts, so I had it sent to our lawyers, who recommended termination.
This was routine,” he said.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Nevertheless, the decision by Dr. Hahn to clarify his remarks and to
grant a series of media interviews appears to have rankled H.H.S.
officials, who saw it as ill-timed, given that the Republican convention
was underway. Trump administration officials are often reluctant to
publicly admit error out of concern that doing so provides political
ammunition to their critics.

Mr. Pines is president of the large health care practice at APCO
Worldwide, a public relations and lobbying firm that [represents health
companies](https://apcoworldwide.com/sectors/health/) that do business
before the F.D.A. He said he did this work on his own, outside of his
APCO practice. He would not say how much he was paid, but noted that as
a friend to Dr. Hahn, he is willing to continue advising him for free.

Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, which promotes
bipartisan political reform, was critical of the contract, noting the
potential for conflicts of interest in Mr. Pines’s work for the F.D.A.,
and his company’s health care client base.

“This notion that, ‘Oh, I’m doing it in my private capacity, on the one
hand, and I’m representing health care interests, on the other,’ it
doesn’t pass the smell test,” said Ms. McGehee.

The F.D.A. did not respond to requests for comment on Friday about Mr.
Pines’s contract or whether it was vetted for conflicts of interest.

Ms. Miller started at the agency on Aug. 17 after a career in both
politics and journalism. In 2004, while working for the Department of
State, [she made
headlines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/05/17/international/powells-interview-is-cut-off.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)
after she apparently cut off an interview for a taped segment between
Tim Russert, the host of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” and her boss, the then
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who could be heard apologizing to
Mr. Russert and saying “Emily, get out of the way.” In 2015, [reporters
cast
doubt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/03/03/additional-document-casts-doubt-on-home-invasion-of-local-fox-reporter/)
on whether Ms. Miller had been a victim of a home invasion, a story that
she had repeatedly included in public remarks and in a book, “Emily Gets
Her Gun: But Obama Wants to Take Yours.”

The decision to hire Ms. Miller as the agency’s top spokeswoman [was
seen as
puzzling](https://www.mediamatters.org/emily-miller/new-fda-spokesperson-emily-miller-pro-trump-sycophant-who-spreads-covid-19)
by outside observers, given that she had little experience in health
care. On May 30, [Ms. Miller
tweeted](https://twitter.com/emilymiller/status/1266938752288657410),
“Remember coronavirus?”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The F.D.A. had been considering allowing the use of convalescent plasma
as a treatment for Covid-19 on an emergency basis, but last week [The
New York Times
reported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/us/politics/blood-plasma-covid-19.html)
that the decision had been delayed after top health officials Dr.
Francis S. Collins and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci intervened and expressed
concern that the available evidence on the effectiveness of the
treatment was too weak. F.D.A. officials argued that although the data
was preliminary and needed continued analysis as more patients are
treated, plasma still met the agency’s standard for emergency use
authorization.

On Saturday morning, Mr. Trump
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1297138862108663808)
that the “deep state” at the F.D.A. was slowing drug development. Late
that night, the White House press secretary
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1297373454262571008) that
the president would have a news conference the next day “concerning a
major therapeutic breakthrough.”

The announcement should have been a rare win for the F.D.A., which for
months had fended off criticism of its track record on the pandemic, and
questions about the [independence of Dr.
Hahn](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/10/health/stephen-hahn-fda.html),
who was previously pressured by Mr. Trump to authorize malaria drugs
that turned out to be ineffective for Covid-19 and carried risks of
harmful side effects. But last weekend, finally, the agency could reveal
some legitimate good news: convalescent plasma, the antibody-rich plasma
donated by Covid-19 survivors, showed promise for a subset of patients
when given early.

[The
announcement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/23/us/politics/fda-plasma-coronavirus.html),
made at the White House on Sunday, has instead spurred a week of
recriminations, anger and mistrust between the F.D.A. and H.H.S. The
officials’ statements Sunday [cast nuanced and preliminary
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/health/fda-blood-plasma.html)
as “a very historic breakthrough,” as Mr. Trump [put
it](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-23-2020/).
The exaggerated statements drew criticism from scientists and at least
three former agency commissioners.

Within the F.D.A. and H.H.S., officials have offered conflicting
accounts for how a single misleading statistic — that plasma led to a 35
percent reduction in deaths — appeared in the remarks of Mr. Trump, Dr.
Hahn and Alex. M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary. It
was also unclear why Dr. Hahn, a longtime cancer doctor, and Mr. Azar, a
former pharmaceutical executive, did not themselves catch the overstated
statistic. No randomized trials have found a survival benefit for
convalescent plasma. The 35 percent number referred to a tiny subset of
patients, and was a relative comparison between two groups, not an
absolute reduction in deaths.

At a speech at the convention on Thursday evening, the president again
overstated what’s known about the benefits of plasma, promising it “will
save thousands and thousands of lives.”

Missteps by the F.D.A., a federal agency that has long prided itself on
its scientific independence, have heightened concerns that the American
public may not be willing to [take a
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
approved by the agency, particularly if the decision is seen as having
been made under pressure from Mr. Trump.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s very important for the leadership of the agency, especially the
commissioner, to be accurate about the information he’s providing and to
do it in a way that really sticks to the facts,” said Dr. Mark
McClellan, who was F.D.A. commissioner under President George W. Bush.

“There’s almost not enough adjectives to describe how appalling this
is,” said Emily K. Brunson, a medical anthropologist at Texas State
University. Opinion polls have shown that many [Americans are already
wary of taking a vaccine for the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-anti-vaccine.html).

If approval of a vaccine is viewed as politically motivated, she said,
“it has the potential to really make this a disastrous situation.”
