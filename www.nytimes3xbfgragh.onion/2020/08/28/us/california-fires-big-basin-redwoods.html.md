*Good Friday morning.*

**Today, we’re starting with something a little different — melancholy
in some ways, but also comforting, we hope: a sampling from the**
**[recent outpouring of
memories](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/reader-center/share-memories-of-big-basin.html?)**
**of** **[Big Basin Redwoods State
Park](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/us/big-basin-redwoods-ca-fires.html).**

**While most of the towering** **[redwoods withstood the
flames](https://apnews.com/efa48694b12c74a9700b03dbe3ffde30)** **from
the** **[massive
wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/california-fires-why-this-year-is-different.html)**
**that have swept through the area, many of the park’s buildings, which
were historic in their own right, were destroyed.**

**My colleague Sona Patel compiled the responses, and** **[Shawn
Hubler](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/shawn-hubler), a
California correspondent who reported on the damage, wrote this
introduction:**

As word spread last week that the California wildfires had reached Big
Basin Redwoods State Park in the Santa Cruz Mountains, social media
erupted. The state park, California’s first, has the largest stretch of
old growth coastal redwoods south of San Francisco, with trees that are,
in many cases, more than 1,000 years old.

“Big Basin is the place that many have their first chance to experience
redwood forests,” said Sara Barth, president of [the Sempervirens
Fund](https://sempervirens.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to the
preservation of Santa Cruz mountain redwoods. So it’s not just another
scenic, inspiring California roadside attraction.

“For many,” she said, “this park is about memories.”

*\[Track the California* [*wildfires with these
maps*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/20/us/california-wildfire-maps.html?)*.\]*

Memories — of parents, of children, of beloved spouses — were what
people shared when we asked about the park’s importance.

“My husband met our son the first time there,”
[tweeted](https://twitter.com/1abby4ever/status/1297639210698956800) one
reader. “My mother and I visited this park in the 80s,”
[wrote](https://twitter.com/mabbot2/status/1297630717778653184) another.

[And](https://twitter.com/1KarieMoody/status/1297450724289155072): “The
last day I got to spend with my husband, we toured these redwoods.”

I have been there twice with my family, in 2004 and in 2018. We took
photos of our kids in front of the same fallen tree, one that I hope has
survived. When my mom was young she camped there in the 1950s with her
parents and brought her pet chicken that she walked around on a leash
made of string. The loss of the infrastructure and the park as we know
it is very sad, but knowing that redwoods are fire-resistant and that
fire is part of a forest’s growth gives me hope for the future of this
great park.

Several of our family camping trips were at Big Basin. Back in the day,
you were encouraged to feed the deer. They sold a bag of oats in the
camp store, as well as Borden’s ice cream sandwiches. We always fed the
deer, and the chipmunks and raccoons. We were eating canned ravioli for
dinner once. My brother was sitting on the log and got up to get a drink
— when we turned around, the chipmunk was eating the ravioli. He decided
to sit down with him and share. It’s a beautiful park and I have taken
my children there to see those trees, banana slugs and chipmunks.

In summer 1991, a bunch of neighborhood friends and I took our kids
camping in the park. There, we played our version of “Kick the Can,” and
the sound of the metal echoed in the woods the entire afternoon. I was
so tired, but the kids had a good time. Later on, some of them learned
what it meant to “kick the can down the road.” They said they recalled
the game we played that afternoon and always alerted themselves not to
kick the can when facing challenges in their lives.

My girlfriend and I flew to California from the East Coast in 2009. We
visited the coast, San Francisco, wine country and Big Basin. This trip
made us fall in love with California, and we ended up living there (now
as husband and wife) from 2013 to 2016. Two dogs and two kids later and
we couldn’t stay away. We just moved back to the Bay Area in 2019.
During the pandemic, I’ve been taking my kids to all of our favorite
places, including Big Basin, after not having visited since 2009. After
11 years we found the exact same spot that cemented our love for the
outdoors in Northern California. I’m glad my kids got to see it.

Most years, when the late fall and winter rains arrive, Big Basin turns
into a Garden of Eden for fungi. I’ve heard that more than 3,000 species
have been observed in the park and adjacent parts of the Santa Cruz
Mountains. I’ve been going there for two decades to photograph the
remarkable winter flora and fauna.

I’m currently a student at U.C. Santa Barbara, but I grew up in San
Jose. If my life was a coming-of-age movie, I feel like Big Basin would
feature prominently. My mom texted me a few days ago with a photo that
sincerely broke my heart: the ranger station, completely burned to the
ground, surrounded by charred trees and rubble. I wanted to cry thinking
about all the times we had pulled up in front of that building, car
jammed full of camping gear.

I wish I could have given my mom a huge hug, but I’m living in Isla
Vista, taking remote classes. I’m majoring in Environmental Studies and
know that fires have always been a part of the redwood forests of
California and that they help make way for new trees and life. But I
worry for the forests this year more than ever. I hope to see photos of
Big Basin bouncing back soon, full of saplings and people exploring the
beauty of the redwoods. Yet, this destructive fire definitely won’t be
the last. Will I be able to camp there when I’m an adult?
