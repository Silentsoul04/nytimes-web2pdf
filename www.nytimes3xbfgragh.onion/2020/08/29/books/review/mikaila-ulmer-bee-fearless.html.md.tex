A little more than halfway through ``Bee Fearless,'' the 10-year-old
C.E.O. Mikaila Ulmer has her first encounter with a fancy advertising
agency. Its experts love the mission of her lemonade business and wonder
if they can help. She takes the meeting, and a designer lets her in on a
secret: ``It's not the product you sell but the story you tell.'' And so
we get this rarest of book breeds: the middle grade start-up memoir, by
a teenager.

Any C.E.O. book ought to do two things. First, it should be a
rip-roaring tale of how the author did it, warts and all.

The origin story of Ulmer's company begins with bee stings, after which
her parents encourage her to learn about the insects rather than fear
them. The bees are in danger, it turns out, as is a large amount of our
food supply if conditions worsen and they no longer pollinate en masse.

So the 4-year-old sets up a lemonade stand outside her house in Austin,
Texas. She sweetens her lemonade with honey, since bees make it and it's
healthy. She serves it with a side of education on all things apian. The
first batch of lemonade is awful, but a series of sticky experiments
yields something better --- unique even, after she gets the idea, from
her great-grandmother's recipe, to add flaxseed. Best of all, it's a
product with a purpose, since she donates money to bee-related
organizations.

People around Austin notice. The owner of a pizza place offers to sell
the beverage if she bottles it. Then the head of the local Black Chamber
of Commerce urges her to audition for the TV series ``Shark Tank.''

You can guess what happens next, if you don't already know. Ulmer gets
on the show, goes to Hollywood and one of the sharks bites. She leaves
town with a \$60,000 investment, and by the end of the book Me \& the
Bees Lemonade is in more than 1,500 stores.

So we have our good yarn. The second task is harder --- for anyone, let
alone a teenager selling her story to other kids: How do you leave
people believing that they too could pull something like this off?

As with any child prodigy, readers will wonder about the stage parents.
Ulmer doesn't sugarcoat. Both her parents have business degrees. Her
father worked at Dell; her mother owned a marketing firm. Eventually her
mom joins Me \& the Bees full time. A group of current and former N.F.L.
players invests \$810,000 in the company, and increased scale enables it
to lower the shelf price to \$2.99 per 12-ounce bottle. But we don't
learn how much money Ulmer is taking out for herself or her college
fund. Nor do we learn how much has gone to the bees. Private companies
have no obligation to report such figures, but authors ought to give a
little more up.

Like many founders' stories, Ulmer's book is meant partly as self-help.
Here she delivers. Bless her for stressing the importance of thank-you
notes. She also writes often and well about connecting with strangers
over a brief transaction. Selling remains one of the most
underappreciated and under-taught life skills; many grown-ups never
learn the art of the pitch.

Remembering names is crucial, too. When Ulmer goes to the White House
for the Kids' State Dinner, Michelle Obama sees her and says, ``Oh,
Mikaila! I know you! Come here,'' before acknowledging her work. ``I
noted it,'' Ulmer writes. ``\emph{Make people feel special and
comfortable.''}

Near the book's end, Ulmer describes telling a group of girls in South
Africa to ``imagine what it would feel like'' to buy things they want
without having to ask others for help. Parents who recall their own
first childhood purchase probably remember the tingle they felt in that
moment --- and want it for their own kids, too.
