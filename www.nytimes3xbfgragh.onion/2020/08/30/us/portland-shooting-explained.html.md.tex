\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/michael-reinoehl-arrest-portland-shooting.html}{Portland},
Ore., has had nightly protests since the killing of George Floyd in
Minneapolis.

On Saturday night, a caravan of supporters of President Trump traveled
through the city, clashing with counterprotesters. A man was
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/michael-forest-reinoehl-portland.html}{shot
and killed during the unrest}.

Here's what we know so far.

\textbf{What happened in Portland?}

Supporters of the president gathered on Saturday at a shopping center a
few miles southeast of Portland. The caravan of hundreds of trucks
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FvCW_nesXs}{then traveled} on
freeways skirting the center of the city. Most were flying ``Trump
2020'' or
\href{https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/06/08/the-short-fraught-history-of-the-thin-blue-line-american-flag}{thin
blue line} flags, which are commonly associated with support for the
police and often seen as antithetical to the Black Lives Matter
movement. Some of the trucks diverted into the downtown.

The caravan clashed with counterprotesters at times.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/us/portland-trump-rally-shooting.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{People
shot paintball guns from trucks} and protesters threw objects at them.
Some conflicts erupted into fistfights. A
\href{https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1299932147973677057?s=20}{video}
showed a small group in the street, where gunfire erupts and a man
collapses.

Chief Chuck Lovell of the Portland police said that the caravan
stretched for miles and that there were pockets of violence. The police
tried to take precautionary measures to prevent vehicles from making
their way downtown.

``We have limited resources,'' Chief Lovell said at a news conference on
Sunday. ``We can't be everywhere at the same time.''

Portland police officers heard reports of gunfire shortly before 9 p.m.
local time and found a man with a gunshot wound to the chest, the police
said.

Medical responders determined that the man was dead, the police said.

Officials asked people to not jump to conclusions about what had
happened and to stay away from Portland as some have expressed a desire
to seek retribution.

\textbf{Who was the man who died?}

The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement on Monday that the man
had been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/31/us/trump-vs-biden/the-police-identified-the-man-who-was-shot-and-killed-in-portland-and-said-no-arrests-have-been-made}{identified
as Aaron J. Danielson}, 39, of Portland.

Mr. Danielson was a member of the far-right group Patriot Prayer, and
was wearing a hat with the group's insignia. Members of the group have
clashed with protesters in the past. The group says it seeks to combat
``corruption, big government and tyranny, using God for strength and the
power of love,''
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/PatriotPrayerUSA/about/?ref=page_internal}{according
to its Facebook page}, which has more than 40,000 followers.

A Patriot Prayer leader, Joey Gibson, said on Sunday that the man was a
good friend and a supporter of the group, but he did not offer further
details.

\textbf{Do we know who the gunman was?}

The police have not released information about who fired the shots.

Chief Lovell said on Sunday that the police were ``working diligently to
find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible.''

The police said on Sunday that they had concluded an investigation of
the shooting scene and asked witnesses or those with video of the
episode to contact detectives.

\textbf{What else has been happening in Portland?}

Protests have occurred nightly in the city since the killing of George
Floyd in May.

In recent weeks, right- and left-wing groups have clashed. On Aug. 22, a
demonstration outside the U.S. courthouse in Portland
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/22/us/portland-protests.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{turned
violent} as right-wing demonstrators, including Proud Boys members,
clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. Objects were thrown,
paintballs were fired and shouting turned to shoving and punching.

The city is no stranger to demonstrations that devolve into chaos, often
stoked by conflicts with the police or between opposing groups.

In 2016, protests over Mr. Trump's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/31/us/trump-vs-biden}{election}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/12/us/trump-protests-election-portland.html}{were
marred} by vandalism and fires. The unrest was labeled a riot by the
police, who deployed pepper spray and rubber ``distraction devices''
against the crowd.

In August 2018, Mr. Gibson led a demonstration that drew hundreds of
Patriot Prayer supporters, many from outside the state,
\href{https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2018/08/protests_converge_in_portland.html}{The
Oregonian reported}. Counterprotesters were ordered by the police to
disperse before officers deployed flash-bang grenades and shoved
counterprotesters out of the street.

Last month, camouflaged
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/portland-federal-legal-jurisdiction-courts.html}{federal
agents} were sent to the city, against the wishes of the local
authorities.

\textbf{What has President Trump said about the situation?}

Mr. Trump has not spoken specifically about the shooting death in
Portland, but on Sunday morning he retweeted a message that said
Portland ``needs to be federalized at this point.''

Mr. Trump
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1300025245626228736?s=20}{added
to the message}: ``The National Guard is Ready, Willing and Able. All
the Governor has to do is call!''

In
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1300010374855524352?s=20}{another
tweet}, Mr. Trump said the ``big backlash going on in Portland cannot be
unexpected.'' He called Portland's mayor, Ted Wheeler, ``incompetent''
and ``a FOOL,'' adding that ``the people of Portland won't put up with
no safety any longer.''

On Sunday afternoon, the mayor sharply criticized Mr. Trump, saying the
president wanted Mr. Wheeler to ``stop the violence that you helped
create.''

``Do you wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades
that Americans have seen this level of violence?'' Mr. Wheeler said.
``It's you who have created the hate and the division.''

Mr. Wheeler said the caravan was ``supported and energized'' by Mr.
Trump.

``I'd appreciate that either the president support us or he stay the
hell out of the way,'' Mr. Wheeler said.

Christina Morales contributed reporting.
