## ‘Who Replaces Me?’

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Lynsea Garrison, and edited by Lisa Tobin and Mike Benoist

#### A Black police officer in Flint, Mich., reflects on what it now means to be part of the force in his hometown.

Monday, August 31st, 2020

</div>

  - scott watson  
    Have you ever — have you ever looked at, like, the state police
    graduating classes? OK. Do me a favor. Go back and look at their
    classes, their graduating classes. See how many Black people you
    see.
    
    We need our police departments to mirror the communities that we are
    serving. And we need those officers to come from within those
    communities. That’ll make the change. When people start seeing we
    really and truly care from our hearts, people will see police in a
    different way.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - archived recording  
    So of course it is disturbing, the number of African-Americans that
    are killed by police. And you know, this is raising a conversation,
    a number of questions about what are the issues that need to be
    tackled within police departments. And one of the things that comes
    up has to do with hiring practices and diversity.

michael barbaro

There’s a growing consensus that to change American policing, police
departments must look more like the communities they serve.

  - archived recording  
    I think to many looking in from the outside, it’s hard to understand
    how the police force could be majority white and the community
    majority African-American. Why can there — how can there be such a
    disconnect or a discrepancy between the two?

michael barbaro

Today:

  - archived recording  
    We’re hiring. We’re hiring.
    
    Get off that protest line and put an application in. And we’ll put
    you in your neighborhood. And we will help you resolve some of the
    problems you protesting about.

michael barbaro

The Daily’s Lynsea Garrison spoke with one officer in Flint, Michigan
about his experience serving the community he grew up in.

It’s Monday, August 31.

  - lynsea garrison  
    OK. So press that button. And then try talking. Do you see little
    wavs —

lynsea garrison

So, I called up Scott Watson.

  - scott watson  
    OK. I’m talking into the actual phone now.

lynsea garrison

He was on duty the night we talked. So he left his police scanner on
just in case he got a call.

  - scott watson  
    I’m — I’m ready as I’ll ever going to be.
    
    So my name is Scott Watson. I’m from — born and raised in Flint,
    Michigan. 53-year-old Black male. And I’ve been a city of Flint
    police officer for the past 23 years.

lynsea garrison

And Scott’s story begins in 1966.

  - scott watson  
    So my mom had me when she was 16.
    
    So you can imagine, you know, having a child at 16 back then wasn’t
    — you know, it wasn’t easy. Coming from a single-parent household,
    honestly, I mean, we struggled.

lynsea garrison

Scott and his mom, they move into the lower level of her brother’s
house. It’s in this neighborhood called St. John’s, which is just on the
edge of the Buick car plant.

  - scott watson  
    It was still segregated for the most part.

lynsea garrison

And Scott’s mom had a job at Sears.

  - scott watson  
    You know, I was a loner child. And my mom never had to, like, get me
    up for school and get me dressed. From tot lot on, you know, I could
    get myself up and get myself together. I didn’t require much.
    
    You know, my mom’s very nice. You know, she did the best she could.
    But she was in love. She was in love with, basically, a bad boy. You
    know, high school, he was one of the stud football players. But he
    liked the streets.
    
    You know, so he ended up going to prison.

lynsea garrison

And he says as a child, he didn’t think much about his dad.

  - scott watson  
    My first real memory of him was going to Jackson prison and visiting
    him. It was just — we went somewhere to visit a man that I really
    didn’t know who, you know, come to find out was my dad.
    
    But at some point within the next couple of years, you know, he got
    out of prison. And that’s where really my experiences — learning, I
    guess learning more about me began.

lynsea garrison

When his dad comes home from prison, it totally changes Scott’s life.

\[music\]

  - scott watson  
    You know, he sold drugs. And I would — I didn’t have a bedroom. So I
    slept on the couch in the living room. You know, it was nothing for
    me to see strange people in the house all the time, people knocking
    on the door the wee hours of the morning to buy drugs. You know, I
    walked in the bathroom, I would see people shooting up heroin.
    That’s what my dad was addicted to, heroin. I could open up a
    bathroom door, I would see pieces of rubber that they used to tie it
    off. Needles, needles with blood on them. At a very young age, I
    knew the difference between — boy was heroin and girl was cocaine.
    You know, we kept it in the basement in the washing machine and in
    the dryer. I mean, you know, there with guns in every corner of the
    house. I had an opportunity to see it all. Things that, you know,
    kids shouldn’t know. But I was never one of those kids who would
    touch any of that stuff.

lynsea garrison

And Scott’s dad, he barely acknowledges Scott. He kind of treats Scott
like he’s not even there.

  - scott watson  
    I mean, this is kind of bad to say. But you know, he would take me
    to the drug houses. And he would leave me there. And he would leave
    with his friends. Or they would talk about drug activity right in
    front of me. And his friends would kind of look, like, you know,
    should we be doing this? And he would just tell them, aww, man, you
    don’t have to worry. He ain’t gonna say nothing. And he was right. I
    would never — I would never say anything about his business. You
    know, you have to remember back in those days, kids stayed in a
    kid’s place. So you know that was all — that was all adult stuff.
    But I took it all in.

lynsea garrison

The only time his dad really does pay attention to Scott is when he
brings him into the business.

  - scott watson  
    So back then, you know, a lot of people were on assistance. You had
    first of the month, people would get their checks. And him and his
    friends, they would go in people’s mailbox and take their checks,
    male or female. And you know, I can remember my dad dressing up like
    a lady and taking me with him to the bank to cash the check. And it
    looked good, you know, having a, you know, a little kid with you.
    But it’s like — it’s like, wow. And it seemed like I’m talking more
    about my dad. Because most of the negativity — the negativity and
    the positivity actually kind of comes from him. Because I wanted to
    be everything that he wasn’t.

lynsea garrison

That drive, Scott says, it motivates him in his quiet way. He keeps on
with school and his homework. He makes himself something to eat,
sometimes just ketchup sandwiches for lunch or dinner. And every free
moment he has, he pours himself into his escape: basketball.

  - archived recording  
    \[SPORTS ANNOUNCER SPEAKING\]

  - scott watson  
    It was the escape for me. I mean, day and night, if there was
    something basketball-related on TV, I watched it.

  - archived recording 1  
    Hoo.

  - archived recording 2  
    You saw it.

  - scott watson  
    The Harlem Globetrotters used to have a variety show back then. So I
    would start learning how to do little tricks and drills and stuff
    and just got good at it.

  - archived recording  
    \[INAUDIBLE\] is trying to keep the game under control.

lynsea garrison

He takes his basketball literally everywhere with him. He even sleeps
with it.

  - scott watson  
    Like some kids had teddy bears and stuff, I didn’t have any of that.
    I had a basketball. Basketball was my best friend. As I got older,
    it was my girlfriend. It was my woman. It’s, like, nothing else, you
    know, really nothing else mattered to me other than to be the best.
    So it took me away from all the negative things that were happening
    around me.

lynsea garrison

And while Scott is outside spending these hours on the street and, you
know, just in his everyday life going to school, he sees police officers
everywhere. They’re doing community policing in his neighborhood then.
They’re doing foot patrol while he’s growing up.

  - scott watson  
    Actually, a friend of mine, his sister, she was on the police
    department.

lynsea garrison

He knows several of his friends whose family are police officers.

  - scott watson  
    So they were pretty much positive role models when I was coming up.

lynsea garrison

Even the times when police officers were called into his house for
various domestic disputes between his father and his mother, even then,
he didn’t have a negative perception of the police. He didn’t really
fault the police in those moments.

  - scott watson  
    I mean, they weren’t nasty or abusive — speaking of the police. At
    the time, they just tried to get the problem solved. So I didn’t
    think anything bad about them. Like, say it was more a reflection on
    my mom and dad.

lynsea garrison

So those were mostly good experiences. But then Scott turns 13.

  - scott watson  
    And then this would be a negative experience. A friend of mine, his
    name was Billy. He was, like, 15. He was not a bad kid. He was just
    kind of mischievous, you know? Just kind of a mischievous kid. But
    him and some more guys broke into a house. And the police showed up.
    And Billy took off running out the backdoor and went to jump a
    fence. And a white police officer shot him in the back of the head
    with his shotgun. Killed him. And that touched off some real
    tensions. You know, people were starting to riot. So that was kind
    of my first bout with kind of like some perceived racism. You know,
    white police officer, Black kid, you know, you shot a young Black
    boy in the head who was running away from a property crime. You
    know? And you killed him. And now I’m angry. But at the same time, I
    was like, man, Billy was wrong. He broke into somebody’s house or
    whatever. So he definitely didn’t deserve that. But you know, he was
    wrong.

lynsea garrison

Over the next couple of years, Scott kind of starts to drift off. His
grandmother dies, which hits him really hard. And he stops playing
basketball. He starts skipping school. Even if he attends class, he
doesn’t really engage. He just sits there quietly. And his G.P.A. ends
up falling to a 0.6. And then two things happen.

  - scott watson  
    So a guy that I was hanging out with, we were skipping school one
    day. And he had a car. And we were going down the highway and we
    were doing over 100 miles an hour. And a semi-truck was in the lane
    next to us and got over in front of us.

lynsea garrison

This humongous semi moves suddenly right in front of their car. And
Scott’s friend in the driver’s seat has to just quickly slam on the
brakes. The car skids.

  - scott watson  
    — brakes. And we almost — I mean, we were right, right up his
    bumper. About to hit it right in the back. And I just see my life
    flash before my eyes. And I’m, like, woo\! I mean, it scared me to
    death.

lynsea garrison

So that happened.

  - scott watson  
    So after that, about a week later, the friend that I was with, he
    was killed. And he was killed by some of my other friends. They got
    into it over a gold chain or something. And they did a drive by and
    they killed him. So he’s dead. And some of my friends, they ended up
    going to prison.

lynsea garrison

And then Scott, he just has this realization. Like, if I don’t make some
changes here, the same kind of future is waiting for me.

  - scott watson  
    And after that happened, it’s like, all right. This is God’s way of
    telling me you got to get your life together. Because nothing good
    is going to come out of that. So —

lynsea garrison

And so he does.

  - scott watson  
    I just start going to school every day and started doing my work.

lynsea garrison

He starts playing basketball again and going to school. And eventually,
he gets spotted by this basketball coach at a junior college in Flint
who’s looking for undiscovered players.

  - scott watson  
    He took me in like I was his son. And I brought a couple of other
    guys along. That was kind of —

lynsea garrison

And while he’s playing there, he’s noticed, again, by Northern Colorado
University. And they offer him a scholarship.

  - scott watson  
    I got a full ride scholarship for basketball.

lynsea garrison

So Scott moves from Flint, Michigan to Greeley, Colorado. And he has to
pick a major.

  - scott watson  
    I knew it from the other side first, by all the criminal activity
    and stuff I’d seen as a little kid. And I mean, I knew — you know, I
    knew about the drug game and the time you could get for committing
    certain crimes. And unknowingly, being a part of crimes — \[LAUGHS\]
    — sometimes, you know, as a little kid.
    
    Criminal justice, it just came easy for me. It was natural for me.

lynsea garrison

And when he graduates, his career choice seems like a natural one, too.

  - scott watson  
    In my mind, everything my dad was, I wanted to be the total
    opposite. So once I was honest with myself and evaluated who I am
    and knowing what I’m capable of, it was easy. It was easy.

lynsea garrison

And so he returns home to Flint and enrolls in the police academy there.

  - scott watson  
    You know, I just kind of went from there.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

lynsea garrison

So Scott moves back home to Flint. And he enrolls in the Flint police
academy. And he says that when he enrolls, at this time in the mid-‘90s,
there’s this huge push for police officers of color. The current police
chief at the time is Black. And he’s really trying to increase the
number of Black police officers in that department. And Scott really
wants to be a part of that.

  - scott watson  
    Now my mom was just like, a police officer? You don’t look like a
    police officer. So I’m explaining to her, I’m like, so what? What
    does a police officer look like? And she really didn’t have — she
    just knew it didn’t look like me. So you know, I’m like, wow. OK.
    But I know me. And who better to protect my community than me?

  - \[police radio in background\]

  - scott watson  
    So my first day on the road, we hit the ground running. I think my
    first night on the road, we ran, like, 50 radio calls.

lynsea garrison

So Scott says they’re responding to these calls, him and these two
supervisors he’s with. And it’s like, every call they respond to, Scott
knows everyone. And these white officers are like —

  - scott watson  
    Man. Every call we go on, you know, I think I impressed my training
    officers. Because every call that we went on, the people know me.
    And I’m just, like, hey, you know? I grew up here. I play sports
    here. So yeah, I know a lot of people.

lynsea garrison

And for Scott, it was this call to duty is being validated on his very
first day of the job.

  - scott watson  
    I don’t think there’s anybody better to do that job than myself.

  - archived recording  
    (POLICE RADIO) 10-4.

lynsea garrison

But then, in his first year —

  - scott watson  
    I was out of training. I was working by myself. And an officer got
    in a chase trying to stop a vehicle.

lynsea garrison

Scott is called in to help pursue a Black suspect who fled during a
traffic stop. So the suspect got out of his vehicle. And he took off
running through the yard. Now this is wintertime. When I say winter, I
mean, it is freezing outside, freezing cold. And it had been snowing a
lot. So here in Michigan, we don’t shovel our backyards or whatever. So
the snow is high. So anyway, this guy he jumps out his vehicle. And he
takes off running. And he runs through these people’s yard. And he tries
to jump a wooden fence and the fence breaks. He doesn’t have a coat on
or anything. And he lands in all this heavy snow. And Scott gets out of
his car. And he’s walking up to the scene.

  - scott watson  
    And all these white officers showed up. And they all kick snow on
    him. Kick snow on his face, on his head. And it made my heart drop.
    So I just — I walked — I stepped right in between all of them.
    Picked him up. Brushed the snow off of him. Handcuffed him. Put him
    in the backseat of my car. And I cut the heat on. And I transport
    him to the station.

\[music\]

  - scott watson  
    And it’s funny because he wasn’t — the suspect wasn’t mad.
    
    You just kind of got the feeling from him that, you know, this just
    business. Like, this is how it’s supposed to be. And I’ve never
    experienced that until then. And I’m like, this is not how it’s
    supposed to be. I think I was more hurt than he was. I mean, he was
    glad that I was there to pick him up and you know, he was so
    appreciative of, you know, I hate to say it like this. But seeing
    that Black face that — it’s, like, you know, OK, I’m safe. You know?
    I’m safe. He took care of me. He’s not going to let anything else
    happen to me.

lynsea garrison

But Scott can’t really get over what he saw.

  - scott watson  
    At that moment, that made me question what’s really going on here.
    It made me, like, is this something I really want to be a part of?

lynsea garrison

He keeps thinking about that.

  - scott watson  
    In that moment, it made me rethink it. But actually, that had to
    make my resolve greater. Because it showed me, it’s like, we need
    more like me and less like that. In the big picture, I need to stay.

lynsea garrison

Scott continues to work in patrol for a number of years. And then he
moves on to this special squad where he’s investigating drugs and gangs
on the streets of Flint. And as he gets further and further into his
career on the force, he kind of grows to believe that he can be a force
for good in all of these smaller ways.

  - scott watson  
    They have block clubs and stuff on the North end of Flint. I would
    go to the block club meetings. I wasn’t getting paid. I wasn’t on
    the police dime. Take kids to the prom for free, so they’ll have a
    nice prom experience. You know, I’ll see somebody who’s hungry, I’ll
    go in my pocket and give them money so they can get something to
    eat. People, they can always reach me by my cell phone. Or you know,
    go get the food for them. Because I don’t buy cigarettes or alcohol
    for them. You know, they have my number. They can pick up the phone
    and call me and I can take care of the problems. I’m always trying
    to help people out with their issues.

lynsea garrison

In 2006, after Scott is in the department for nearly a decade, something
happens in Flint.

  - scott watson  
    The Black pastors complain that there wasn’t enough minorities in
    the upper administrative positions in the police department. It
    didn’t reflect our community. So the Black pastors wanted — it was
    a white mayor. They wanted him to do something about it.

lynsea garrison

And you know, it’s an interesting time in the police department. Because
it’s almost equal parts white officers and equal parts Black officers.
Scott said that basically the Black officers that were recruited by the
Black police chief in the ‘90s, back when Scott joined, a lot of those
officers were still around. But what the pastors were complaining about
was that hardly any of those Black officers were in positions of
command. The captains, the lieutenants, the sergeants, all the way up to
the chief, those positions were overwhelmingly white.

  - scott watson  
    So the Black pastors wanted — it was a white mayor — they wanted him
    to do something about it. So he came up with the idea of having a
    group of officers outside of the regular ranks be above everybody in
    the regular ranks. And they were called a citizen’s service bureau.

lynsea garrison

And then he promotes four Black officers into that group.

  - scott watson  
    But there was no rhyme or reason how he chose these people. There
    was no testing. There was no nothing. This is just who he wanted.

lynsea garrison

Almost immediately, the police unions respond.

  - scott watson  
    The white officers in the department got together with the union and
    filed a lawsuit. And it was a reverse discrimination lawsuit.

lynsea garrison

More than 40 officers file a reverse discrimination lawsuit, complaining
that the mayor had no basis for those promotions. He didn’t follow any
procedure. And he overlooked qualified white officers in those
promotions.

  - scott watson  
    Well, the Black officers were like, well, hold up here. You know,
    this is unfair to us. If there is no testing procedure, you know, it
    affects us also. And it’s, like, wow. So long story short, all the
    white officers, the lowest amount of money they got was like
    $25,000.

lynsea garrison

The white officers actually win the case. The city loses millions of
dollars. And Scott is feeling totally blindsided.

  - scott watson  
    It felt like, honestly, us against them at that point. You know,
    when you see all the white officers band together, and basically we
    were — the Black officers were kept out. And it’s, like, uh, we’re
    not one. I mean — so yeah. There’s you guys over here and us over
    here.

lynsea garrison

And that’s pretty much how Scott comes to think about the department. As
two departments.

  - scott watson  
    So for us Blacks, we’re like, wow. You know, y’all walk around here
    preaching, you know, thin blue line, and we’re all brothers. But I
    think people — they had a thin blue line kind of wrong. Within that
    thin blue line is a racial divide also. And that’s the part that I
    don’t think people see. We smile in each other’s faces. But you
    know, in the back of your mind, when the chips are down, there’s a
    division. And you can tell, in their circles, when it’s just them,
    it’s a lot different than when they’re around us.

lynsea garrison

This all comes into greater focus for Scott with the killing of George
Floyd.

  - scott watson  
    So initially, someone was telling me about it. But I hadn’t seen the
    video. So maybe a day or two after it happened, I seen the video.
    And I was — it hurt me to my core. To my core.

lynsea garrison

Suddenly, his identity as a Black officer, rather than feeling like a
source of pride, it turns into a source of self-consciousness.

  - scott watson  
    Right after this, after I seen the video, I came to work. Oh my
    gosh. I was embarrassed to put a uniform on. I was embarrassed to
    get out of my cruiser. I stopped at — one of the guys who barbecue
    on the street, you know, and I stopped to get something to eat. And
    I just felt — I really felt like I didn’t belong. The embarrassment
    that I felt and people looking at me, like, you know, there go one
    of them right there. You know? That’s what I felt. And I just wanted
    to stay out the way. I didn’t want to make no traffic stops.
    
    That night, after the stuff happened, it’s about 2 o’clock in the
    morning. And I’m in a semi-marked car. And I’m riding down the main
    street. But it’s pretty much empty. And this car fly, they fly by
    me. And so I pull them over. I got lights and sirens and stuff. So I
    pull them over. And I walk up to the car. And I’m just as polite,
    and it was a male and a female. And the male was driving, a Black
    couple. I’m like, you know, your license, registration, proof of
    insurance, and whatever. And I asked him if he knew why I stopped
    him. Oh. I mean, he was so disrespectful to me and just talking
    about how we don’t do nothing but kill people. And I mean, he was
    cussing at me. And I still just kept my composure. I’m like, OK. He
    mad. They’re mad. I get it. I understand. What they don’t understand
    is I’m mad also.
    
    So I ran his name and everything. He had a good driver’s license and
    everything. Didn’t write him a ticket or anything. And I just walked
    back up to his car and I gave him his stuff back. And I told him,
    y’all have a good night. And after I said that, he couldn’t
    respond. It’s almost like he couldn’t believe. Like man, he didn’t
    cuss me out or anything. But I was hurt. But I kind of had to just
    hide it.
    
    Honestly, it’s just been feeling like everybody is against you. I
    mean, your own people call you Uncle Tom, sellout. And then you got
    your white counterparts who, you know —

lynsea garrison

Again, Scott is having this feeling that there are these conversations
going on in the office that he’s not really a part of. He says in the
conversations that he’s hearing, everyone is flatly condemning what
happened to George Floyd. But then he goes on Facebook.

  - scott watson  
    \[SIGHS\] You know, there’s been some things, social media post by
    officers, white officers, that were less than —
    
    it made officers feel some type of way, specifically our Black
    officers.
    
    I don’t even know how to really approach the subject. But we have
    some officers, some young white officers who made some statements on
    social media.

lynsea garrison

This is what Scott said he saw.

  - scott watson  
    We felt were inappropriate.

lynsea garrison

He reads one post from a white colleague that said George Floyd was a
piece of shit and a criminal.

  - scott watson  
    — said he was a criminal.

lynsea garrison

And then he reads another comment from a white supervisor who writes
that —

  - scott watson  
    Wow.

lynsea garrison

— there must have been a big fight before that happened.

  - scott watson  
    It really rubbed me the wrong way. But I was —

lynsea garrison

Another white colleague reposted a picture that said, “Only in America
can an ethnic group have Black awareness month, a Black holiday, Black
only colleges, Black only dating sites, Black only bars and clubs, and
turn around and call everyone else racists.

  - lynsea garrison  
    But these are colleagues that you probably see every day?

  - scott watson  
    Yes. So it’s always difficult when you know people feel like that in
    your heart.
    
    It’s tough. So even now, you know, I still speak to them. And I
    still treat them the same because I was their supervisor.
    
    But did it make me feel some type of way? Yes. And did it make other
    Black officers feel some type of way? Absolutely.
    
    Can you truly protect and serve the people where you work if that’s
    how you truly feel?

  - lynsea garrison  
    Do you think, Scott, you’ve been able to make a difference in
    policing?

  - scott watson  
    \[SIGHS\] It probably depends on which day you talk to me.
    \[LAUGHING\] Some days — you know, I try to help people every day.
    And I help a lot of people. You know, I get calls from jails and
    prisons all the time, and attorneys and prosecutors and victims. And
    you know, so I look at individual things where I’ve been able to
    help people in one way or another. And I’ll take those as wins. But
    when I look at the overall career and where we were at when I came
    on the department and where we’re at now, it doesn’t feel like a
    win.

  - lynsea garrison  
    What’s that feel like?

  - scott watson  
    Crap. It makes you feel like — it makes you feel like crap. I don’t
    want to say it’s been wasted. But if we, as Black officers haven’t
    changed the minds and hearts of our white officers, it just don’t
    feel like a win.

  - lynsea garrison  
    Hm.

  - scott watson  
    So where do we go from here? Where do I go from here?
    
    I’m trying to get my mojo back. But I keep seeing the same stuff.
    
    I haven’t seen change. I haven’t seen real change yet.
    
    But I’m going to retire. And I’m going to go off into the sunset. I
    hate to retire in a sense, because who replaces me? Will it be
    someone not from our community?
    
    So the real answer is, I don’t know.

  - lynsea garrison  
    I guess I’m still wondering, and I don’t mean to belabor this point.
    But you hear so much about recruiting more Black officers as one of
    the solutions for reform. And I feel like this kind of call for
    diversity happens each time. I mean, when Michael Brown was shot, a
    big criticism was that the Ferguson police department didn’t go home
    at night to Ferguson. They went to their suburbs, far away from
    Ferguson. They didn’t actually live in the community they policed.
    And after the Dallas shootings, the five officers in Dallas were
    shot, I remember that Dallas police chief said, like, if you want to
    change, we’re hiring. Get off the protest line. And come in —

  - scott watson  
    Come on in.

  - lynsea garrison  
    — to the police department. Yeah. Yeah.

  - scott watson  
    That’s true.

  - lynsea garrison  
    And is that true, though? Is that the thing that will change? Or
    would you get a flood of Black police officers who are, I don’t
    know, divided from the white officers. Then you’d have these two
    departments instead of this one department. And that would limit the
    change that those Black officers could bring.

  - scott watson  
    I mean, that’s a very tough question.
    
    I don’t know. I don’t have a definitive answer for that. But I will
    say this.
    
    I just went to the park not too long ago. And I had a basketball, a
    brand new basketball that was sitting around my house that I had
    bought for my son. And I went to this one park. And I’m like, you
    know what? I’m going to just go out there and just get me some shots
    up. And just kick it with the people that I know, you know? And when
    I’m done, I’m going to let them keep this basketball. So when they
    have good games going on or whatever, you know, they’ll have a
    really good basketball to use. You know it will be the park
    basketball. But it’s little things like that. But that’s just me.
    You know? That’s just me.

In a statement to The Times, the City of Flint acknowledged that the
police department had received complaints about Facebook posts made by
police officers, and said that each of the complaints was investigated
and quote, “appropriately handled.” They also noted that the department
has recently launched a special recruitment effort to hire more officers
who are from Flint. The city has also hired a new chief of police,
Terence Green, who was himself born and raised in Flint. Green has said
that addressing the morale of officers is among his first priorities
coming into office. He begins his post tomorrow.

We’ll be right back.

Over the weekend, a man affiliated with a right-wing group was shot and
killed in Portland, Oregon during a confrontation between supporters of
President Trump and demonstrators protesting police brutality.

The pro-Trump supporters had staged a rally that involved driving
through downtown Portland where they clashed with protesters who have
demonstrated there for months since the police killing of George Floyd.

The man who was shot and killed was wearing a hat with the insignia of
Patriot Prayer, a far right group based in the Portland area that has
clashed with protesters in the past. President Trump, who has repeatedly
highlighted the unrest in Portland in his re-election campaign, said it
was the latest evidence that Democratic-run cities are out of control.
In a tweet defending his supporters, the president wrote, quote, “The
big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected.” In response,
his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, accused the president of quote,
“recklessly encouraging violence.”

  - scott watson  
    Have you ever — have you ever looked at, like, the state police
    graduating classes? OK. Do me a favor. Go back and look at their
    classes, their graduating classes. See how many Black people you
    see.
    
    We need our police departments to mirror the communities that we are
    serving. And we need those officers to come from within those
    communities. That’ll make the change. When people start seeing we
    really and truly care from our hearts, people will see police in a
    different way.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - archived recording  
    So of course it is disturbing, the number of African-Americans that
    are killed by police. And you know, this is raising a conversation,
    a number of questions about what are the issues that need to be
    tackled within police departments. And one of the things that comes
    up has to do with hiring practices and diversity.

michael barbaro

There’s a growing consensus that to change American policing, police
departments must look more like the communities they serve.

  - archived recording  
    I think to many looking in from the outside, it’s hard to understand
    how the police force could be majority white and the community
    majority African-American. Why can there — how can there be such a
    disconnect or a discrepancy between the two?

michael barbaro

Today:

  - archived recording  
    We’re hiring. We’re hiring.
    
    Get off that protest line and put an application in. And we’ll put
    you in your neighborhood. And we will help you resolve some of the
    problems you protesting about.

michael barbaro

The Daily’s Lynsea Garrison spoke with one officer in Flint, Michigan
about his experience serving the community he grew up in.

It’s Monday, August 31.

  - lynsea garrison  
    OK. So press that button. And then try talking. Do you see little
    wavs —

lynsea garrison

So, I called up Scott Watson.

  - scott watson  
    OK. I’m talking into the actual phone now.

lynsea garrison

He was on duty the night we talked. So he left his police scanner on
just in case he got a call.

  - scott watson  
    I’m — I’m ready as I’ll ever going to be.
    
    So my name is Scott Watson. I’m from — born and raised in Flint,
    Michigan. 53-year-old Black male. And I’ve been a city of Flint
    police officer for the past 23 years.

lynsea garrison

And Scott’s story begins in 1966.

  - scott watson  
    So my mom had me when she was 16.
    
    So you can imagine, you know, having a child at 16 back then wasn’t
    — you know, it wasn’t easy. Coming from a single-parent household,
    honestly, I mean, we struggled.

lynsea garrison

Scott and his mom, they move into the lower level of her brother’s
house. It’s in this neighborhood called St. John’s, which is just on the
edge of the Buick car plant.

  - scott watson  
    It was still segregated for the most part.

lynsea garrison

And Scott’s mom had a job at Sears.

  - scott watson  
    You know, I was a loner child. And my mom never had to, like, get me
    up for school and get me dressed. From tot lot on, you know, I could
    get myself up and get myself together. I didn’t require much.
    
    You know, my mom’s very nice. You know, she did the best she could.
    But she was in love. She was in love with, basically, a bad boy. You
    know, high school, he was one of the stud football players. But he
    liked the streets.
    
    You know, so he ended up going to prison.

lynsea garrison

And he says as a child, he didn’t think much about his dad.

  - scott watson  
    My first real memory of him was going to Jackson prison and visiting
    him. It was just — we went somewhere to visit a man that I really
    didn’t know who, you know, come to find out was my dad.
    
    But at some point within the next couple of years, you know, he got
    out of prison. And that’s where really my experiences — learning, I
    guess learning more about me began.

lynsea garrison

When his dad comes home from prison, it totally changes Scott’s life.

\[music\]

  - scott watson  
    You know, he sold drugs. And I would — I didn’t have a bedroom. So I
    slept on the couch in the living room. You know, it was nothing for
    me to see strange people in the house all the time, people knocking
    on the door the wee hours of the morning to buy drugs. You know, I
    walked in the bathroom, I would see people shooting up heroin.
    That’s what my dad was addicted to, heroin. I could open up a
    bathroom door, I would see pieces of rubber that they used to tie it
    off. Needles, needles with blood on them. At a very young age, I
    knew the difference between — boy was heroin and girl was cocaine.
    You know, we kept it in the basement in the washing machine and in
    the dryer. I mean, you know, there with guns in every corner of the
    house. I had an opportunity to see it all. Things that, you know,
    kids shouldn’t know. But I was never one of those kids who would
    touch any of that stuff.

lynsea garrison

And Scott’s dad, he barely acknowledges Scott. He kind of treats Scott
like he’s not even there.

  - scott watson  
    I mean, this is kind of bad to say. But you know, he would take me
    to the drug houses. And he would leave me there. And he would leave
    with his friends. Or they would talk about drug activity right in
    front of me. And his friends would kind of look, like, you know,
    should we be doing this? And he would just tell them, aww, man, you
    don’t have to worry. He ain’t gonna say nothing. And he was right. I
    would never — I would never say anything about his business. You
    know, you have to remember back in those days, kids stayed in a
    kid’s place. So you know that was all — that was all adult stuff.
    But I took it all in.

lynsea garrison

The only time his dad really does pay attention to Scott is when he
brings him into the business.

  - scott watson  
    So back then, you know, a lot of people were on assistance. You had
    first of the month, people would get their checks. And him and his
    friends, they would go in people’s mailbox and take their checks,
    male or female. And you know, I can remember my dad dressing up like
    a lady and taking me with him to the bank to cash the check. And it
    looked good, you know, having a, you know, a little kid with you.
    But it’s like — it’s like, wow. And it seemed like I’m talking more
    about my dad. Because most of the negativity — the negativity and
    the positivity actually kind of comes from him. Because I wanted to
    be everything that he wasn’t.

lynsea garrison

That drive, Scott says, it motivates him in his quiet way. He keeps on
with school and his homework. He makes himself something to eat,
sometimes just ketchup sandwiches for lunch or dinner. And every free
moment he has, he pours himself into his escape: basketball.

  - archived recording  
    \[SPORTS ANNOUNCER SPEAKING\]

  - scott watson  
    It was the escape for me. I mean, day and night, if there was
    something basketball-related on TV, I watched it.

  - archived recording 1  
    Hoo.

  - archived recording 2  
    You saw it.

  - scott watson  
    The Harlem Globetrotters used to have a variety show back then. So I
    would start learning how to do little tricks and drills and stuff
    and just got good at it.

  - archived recording  
    \[INAUDIBLE\] is trying to keep the game under control.

lynsea garrison

He takes his basketball literally everywhere with him. He even sleeps
with it.

  - scott watson  
    Like some kids had teddy bears and stuff, I didn’t have any of that.
    I had a basketball. Basketball was my best friend. As I got older,
    it was my girlfriend. It was my woman. It’s, like, nothing else, you
    know, really nothing else mattered to me other than to be the best.
    So it took me away from all the negative things that were happening
    around me.

lynsea garrison

And while Scott is outside spending these hours on the street and, you
know, just in his everyday life going to school, he sees police officers
everywhere. They’re doing community policing in his neighborhood then.
They’re doing foot patrol while he’s growing up.

  - scott watson  
    Actually, a friend of mine, his sister, she was on the police
    department.

lynsea garrison

He knows several of his friends whose family are police officers.

  - scott watson  
    So they were pretty much positive role models when I was coming up.

lynsea garrison

Even the times when police officers were called into his house for
various domestic disputes between his father and his mother, even then,
he didn’t have a negative perception of the police. He didn’t really
fault the police in those moments.

  - scott watson  
    I mean, they weren’t nasty or abusive — speaking of the police. At
    the time, they just tried to get the problem solved. So I didn’t
    think anything bad about them. Like, say it was more a reflection on
    my mom and dad.

lynsea garrison

So those were mostly good experiences. But then Scott turns 13.

  - scott watson  
    And then this would be a negative experience. A friend of mine, his
    name was Billy. He was, like, 15. He was not a bad kid. He was just
    kind of mischievous, you know? Just kind of a mischievous kid. But
    him and some more guys broke into a house. And the police showed up.
    And Billy took off running out the backdoor and went to jump a
    fence. And a white police officer shot him in the back of the head
    with his shotgun. Killed him. And that touched off some real
    tensions. You know, people were starting to riot. So that was kind
    of my first bout with kind of like some perceived racism. You know,
    white police officer, Black kid, you know, you shot a young Black
    boy in the head who was running away from a property crime. You
    know? And you killed him. And now I’m angry. But at the same time, I
    was like, man, Billy was wrong. He broke into somebody’s house or
    whatever. So he definitely didn’t deserve that. But you know, he was
    wrong.

lynsea garrison

Over the next couple of years, Scott kind of starts to drift off. His
grandmother dies, which hits him really hard. And he stops playing
basketball. He starts skipping school. Even if he attends class, he
doesn’t really engage. He just sits there quietly. And his G.P.A. ends
up falling to a 0.6. And then two things happen.

  - scott watson  
    So a guy that I was hanging out with, we were skipping school one
    day. And he had a car. And we were going down the highway and we
    were doing over 100 miles an hour. And a semi-truck was in the lane
    next to us and got over in front of us.

lynsea garrison

This humongous semi moves suddenly right in front of their car. And
Scott’s friend in the driver’s seat has to just quickly slam on the
brakes. The car skids.

  - scott watson  
    — brakes. And we almost — I mean, we were right, right up his
    bumper. About to hit it right in the back. And I just see my life
    flash before my eyes. And I’m, like, woo\! I mean, it scared me to
    death.

lynsea garrison

So that happened.

  - scott watson  
    So after that, about a week later, the friend that I was with, he
    was killed. And he was killed by some of my other friends. They got
    into it over a gold chain or something. And they did a drive by and
    they killed him. So he’s dead. And some of my friends, they ended up
    going to prison.

lynsea garrison

And then Scott, he just has this realization. Like, if I don’t make some
changes here, the same kind of future is waiting for me.

  - scott watson  
    And after that happened, it’s like, all right. This is God’s way of
    telling me you got to get your life together. Because nothing good
    is going to come out of that. So —

lynsea garrison

And so he does.

  - scott watson  
    I just start going to school every day and started doing my work.

lynsea garrison

He starts playing basketball again and going to school. And eventually,
he gets spotted by this basketball coach at a junior college in Flint
who’s looking for undiscovered players.

  - scott watson  
    He took me in like I was his son. And I brought a couple of other
    guys along. That was kind of —

lynsea garrison

And while he’s playing there, he’s noticed, again, by Northern Colorado
University. And they offer him a scholarship.

  - scott watson  
    I got a full ride scholarship for basketball.

lynsea garrison

So Scott moves from Flint, Michigan to Greeley, Colorado. And he has to
pick a major.

  - scott watson  
    I knew it from the other side first, by all the criminal activity
    and stuff I’d seen as a little kid. And I mean, I knew — you know, I
    knew about the drug game and the time you could get for committing
    certain crimes. And unknowingly, being a part of crimes — \[LAUGHS\]
    — sometimes, you know, as a little kid.
    
    Criminal justice, it just came easy for me. It was natural for me.

lynsea garrison

And when he graduates, his career choice seems like a natural one, too.

  - scott watson  
    In my mind, everything my dad was, I wanted to be the total
    opposite. So once I was honest with myself and evaluated who I am
    and knowing what I’m capable of, it was easy. It was easy.

lynsea garrison

And so he returns home to Flint and enrolls in the police academy there.

  - scott watson  
    You know, I just kind of went from there.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

lynsea garrison

So Scott moves back home to Flint. And he enrolls in the Flint police
academy. And he says that when he enrolls, at this time in the mid-‘90s,
there’s this huge push for police officers of color. The current police
chief at the time is Black. And he’s really trying to increase the
number of Black police officers in that department. And Scott really
wants to be a part of that.

  - scott watson  
    Now my mom was just like, a police officer? You don’t look like a
    police officer. So I’m explaining to her, I’m like, so what? What
    does a police officer look like? And she really didn’t have — she
    just knew it didn’t look like me. So you know, I’m like, wow. OK.
    But I know me. And who better to protect my community than me?

  - \[police radio in background\]

  - scott watson  
    So my first day on the road, we hit the ground running. I think my
    first night on the road, we ran, like, 50 radio calls.

lynsea garrison

So Scott says they’re responding to these calls, him and these two
supervisors he’s with. And it’s like, every call they respond to, Scott
knows everyone. And these white officers are like —

  - scott watson  
    Man. Every call we go on, you know, I think I impressed my training
    officers. Because every call that we went on, the people know me.
    And I’m just, like, hey, you know? I grew up here. I play sports
    here. So yeah, I know a lot of people.

lynsea garrison

And for Scott, it was this call to duty is being validated on his very
first day of the job.

  - scott watson  
    I don’t think there’s anybody better to do that job than myself.

  - archived recording  
    (POLICE RADIO) 10-4.

lynsea garrison

But then, in his first year —

  - scott watson  
    I was out of training. I was working by myself. And an officer got
    in a chase trying to stop a vehicle.

lynsea garrison

Scott is called in to help pursue a Black suspect who fled during a
traffic stop. So the suspect got out of his vehicle. And he took off
running through the yard. Now this is wintertime. When I say winter, I
mean, it is freezing outside, freezing cold. And it had been snowing a
lot. So here in Michigan, we don’t shovel our backyards or whatever. So
the snow is high. So anyway, this guy he jumps out his vehicle. And he
takes off running. And he runs through these people’s yard. And he tries
to jump a wooden fence and the fence breaks. He doesn’t have a coat on
or anything. And he lands in all this heavy snow. And Scott gets out of
his car. And he’s walking up to the scene.

  - scott watson  
    And all these white officers showed up. And they all kick snow on
    him. Kick snow on his face, on his head. And it made my heart drop.
    So I just — I walked — I stepped right in between all of them.
    Picked him up. Brushed the snow off of him. Handcuffed him. Put him
    in the backseat of my car. And I cut the heat on. And I transport
    him to the station.

\[music\]

  - scott watson  
    And it’s funny because he wasn’t — the suspect wasn’t mad.
    
    You just kind of got the feeling from him that, you know, this just
    business. Like, this is how it’s supposed to be. And I’ve never
    experienced that until then. And I’m like, this is not how it’s
    supposed to be. I think I was more hurt than he was. I mean, he was
    glad that I was there to pick him up and you know, he was so
    appreciative of, you know, I hate to say it like this. But seeing
    that Black face that — it’s, like, you know, OK, I’m safe. You know?
    I’m safe. He took care of me. He’s not going to let anything else
    happen to me.

lynsea garrison

But Scott can’t really get over what he saw.

  - scott watson  
    At that moment, that made me question what’s really going on here.
    It made me, like, is this something I really want to be a part of?

lynsea garrison

He keeps thinking about that.

  - scott watson  
    In that moment, it made me rethink it. But actually, that had to
    make my resolve greater. Because it showed me, it’s like, we need
    more like me and less like that. In the big picture, I need to stay.

lynsea garrison

Scott continues to work in patrol for a number of years. And then he
moves on to this special squad where he’s investigating drugs and gangs
on the streets of Flint. And as he gets further and further into his
career on the force, he kind of grows to believe that he can be a force
for good in all of these smaller ways.

  - scott watson  
    They have block clubs and stuff on the North end of Flint. I would
    go to the block club meetings. I wasn’t getting paid. I wasn’t on
    the police dime. Take kids to the prom for free, so they’ll have a
    nice prom experience. You know, I’ll see somebody who’s hungry, I’ll
    go in my pocket and give them money so they can get something to
    eat. People, they can always reach me by my cell phone. Or you know,
    go get the food for them. Because I don’t buy cigarettes or alcohol
    for them. You know, they have my number. They can pick up the phone
    and call me and I can take care of the problems. I’m always trying
    to help people out with their issues.

lynsea garrison

In 2006, after Scott is in the department for nearly a decade, something
happens in Flint.

  - scott watson  
    The Black pastors complain that there wasn’t enough minorities in
    the upper administrative positions in the police department. It
    didn’t reflect our community. So the Black pastors wanted — it was
    a white mayor. They wanted him to do something about it.

lynsea garrison

And you know, it’s an interesting time in the police department. Because
it’s almost equal parts white officers and equal parts Black officers.
Scott said that basically the Black officers that were recruited by the
Black police chief in the ‘90s, back when Scott joined, a lot of those
officers were still around. But what the pastors were complaining about
was that hardly any of those Black officers were in positions of
command. The captains, the lieutenants, the sergeants, all the way up to
the chief, those positions were overwhelmingly white.

  - scott watson  
    So the Black pastors wanted — it was a white mayor — they wanted him
    to do something about it. So he came up with the idea of having a
    group of officers outside of the regular ranks be above everybody in
    the regular ranks. And they were called a citizen’s service bureau.

lynsea garrison

And then he promotes four Black officers into that group.

  - scott watson  
    But there was no rhyme or reason how he chose these people. There
    was no testing. There was no nothing. This is just who he wanted.

lynsea garrison

Almost immediately, the police unions respond.

  - scott watson  
    The white officers in the department got together with the union and
    filed a lawsuit. And it was a reverse discrimination lawsuit.

lynsea garrison

More than 40 officers file a reverse discrimination lawsuit, complaining
that the mayor had no basis for those promotions. He didn’t follow any
procedure. And he overlooked qualified white officers in those
promotions.

  - scott watson  
    Well, the Black officers were like, well, hold up here. You know,
    this is unfair to us. If there is no testing procedure, you know, it
    affects us also. And it’s, like, wow. So long story short, all the
    white officers, the lowest amount of money they got was like
    $25,000.

lynsea garrison

The white officers actually win the case. The city loses millions of
dollars. And Scott is feeling totally blindsided.

  - scott watson  
    It felt like, honestly, us against them at that point. You know,
    when you see all the white officers band together, and basically we
    were — the Black officers were kept out. And it’s, like, uh, we’re
    not one. I mean — so yeah. There’s you guys over here and us over
    here.

lynsea garrison

And that’s pretty much how Scott comes to think about the department. As
two departments.

  - scott watson  
    So for us Blacks, we’re like, wow. You know, y’all walk around here
    preaching, you know, thin blue line, and we’re all brothers. But I
    think people — they had a thin blue line kind of wrong. Within that
    thin blue line is a racial divide also. And that’s the part that I
    don’t think people see. We smile in each other’s faces. But you
    know, in the back of your mind, when the chips are down, there’s a
    division. And you can tell, in their circles, when it’s just them,
    it’s a lot different than when they’re around us.

lynsea garrison

This all comes into greater focus for Scott with the killing of George
Floyd.

  - scott watson  
    So initially, someone was telling me about it. But I hadn’t seen the
    video. So maybe a day or two after it happened, I seen the video.
    And I was — it hurt me to my core. To my core.

lynsea garrison

Suddenly, his identity as a Black officer, rather than feeling like a
source of pride, it turns into a source of self-consciousness.

  - scott watson  
    Right after this, after I seen the video, I came to work. Oh my
    gosh. I was embarrassed to put a uniform on. I was embarrassed to
    get out of my cruiser. I stopped at — one of the guys who barbecue
    on the street, you know, and I stopped to get something to eat. And
    I just felt — I really felt like I didn’t belong. The embarrassment
    that I felt and people looking at me, like, you know, there go one
    of them right there. You know? That’s what I felt. And I just wanted
    to stay out the way. I didn’t want to make no traffic stops.
    
    That night, after the stuff happened, it’s about 2 o’clock in the
    morning. And I’m in a semi-marked car. And I’m riding down the main
    street. But it’s pretty much empty. And this car fly, they fly by
    me. And so I pull them over. I got lights and sirens and stuff. So I
    pull them over. And I walk up to the car. And I’m just as polite,
    and it was a male and a female. And the male was driving, a Black
    couple. I’m like, you know, your license, registration, proof of
    insurance, and whatever. And I asked him if he knew why I stopped
    him. Oh. I mean, he was so disrespectful to me and just talking
    about how we don’t do nothing but kill people. And I mean, he was
    cussing at me. And I still just kept my composure. I’m like, OK. He
    mad. They’re mad. I get it. I understand. What they don’t understand
    is I’m mad also.
    
    So I ran his name and everything. He had a good driver’s license and
    everything. Didn’t write him a ticket or anything. And I just walked
    back up to his car and I gave him his stuff back. And I told him,
    y’all have a good night. And after I said that, he couldn’t
    respond. It’s almost like he couldn’t believe. Like man, he didn’t
    cuss me out or anything. But I was hurt. But I kind of had to just
    hide it.
    
    Honestly, it’s just been feeling like everybody is against you. I
    mean, your own people call you Uncle Tom, sellout. And then you got
    your white counterparts who, you know —

lynsea garrison

Again, Scott is having this feeling that there are these conversations
going on in the office that he’s not really a part of. He says in the
conversations that he’s hearing, everyone is flatly condemning what
happened to George Floyd. But then he goes on Facebook.

  - scott watson  
    \[SIGHS\] You know, there’s been some things, social media post by
    officers, white officers, that were less than —
    
    it made officers feel some type of way, specifically our Black
    officers.
    
    I don’t even know how to really approach the subject. But we have
    some officers, some young white officers who made some statements on
    social media.

lynsea garrison

This is what Scott said he saw.

  - scott watson  
    We felt were inappropriate.

lynsea garrison

He reads one post from a white colleague that said George Floyd was a
piece of shit and a criminal.

  - scott watson  
    — said he was a criminal.

lynsea garrison

And then he reads another comment from a white supervisor who writes
that —

  - scott watson  
    Wow.

lynsea garrison

— there must have been a big fight before that happened.

  - scott watson  
    It really rubbed me the wrong way. But I was —

lynsea garrison

Another white colleague reposted a picture that said, “Only in America
can an ethnic group have Black awareness month, a Black holiday, Black
only colleges, Black only dating sites, Black only bars and clubs, and
turn around and call everyone else racists.

  - lynsea garrison  
    But these are colleagues that you probably see every day?

  - scott watson  
    Yes. So it’s always difficult when you know people feel like that in
    your heart.
    
    It’s tough. So even now, you know, I still speak to them. And I
    still treat them the same because I was their supervisor.
    
    But did it make me feel some type of way? Yes. And did it make other
    Black officers feel some type of way? Absolutely.
    
    Can you truly protect and serve the people where you work if that’s
    how you truly feel?

  - lynsea garrison  
    Do you think, Scott, you’ve been able to make a difference in
    policing?

  - scott watson  
    \[SIGHS\] It probably depends on which day you talk to me.
    \[LAUGHING\] Some days — you know, I try to help people every day.
    And I help a lot of people. You know, I get calls from jails and
    prisons all the time, and attorneys and prosecutors and victims. And
    you know, so I look at individual things where I’ve been able to
    help people in one way or another. And I’ll take those as wins. But
    when I look at the overall career and where we were at when I came
    on the department and where we’re at now, it doesn’t feel like a
    win.

  - lynsea garrison  
    What’s that feel like?

  - scott watson  
    Crap. It makes you feel like — it makes you feel like crap. I don’t
    want to say it’s been wasted. But if we, as Black officers haven’t
    changed the minds and hearts of our white officers, it just don’t
    feel like a win.

  - lynsea garrison  
    Hm.

  - scott watson  
    So where do we go from here? Where do I go from here?
    
    I’m trying to get my mojo back. But I keep seeing the same stuff.
    
    I haven’t seen change. I haven’t seen real change yet.
    
    But I’m going to retire. And I’m going to go off into the sunset. I
    hate to retire in a sense, because who replaces me? Will it be
    someone not from our community?
    
    So the real answer is, I don’t know.

  - lynsea garrison  
    I guess I’m still wondering, and I don’t mean to belabor this point.
    But you hear so much about recruiting more Black officers as one of
    the solutions for reform. And I feel like this kind of call for
    diversity happens each time. I mean, when Michael Brown was shot, a
    big criticism was that the Ferguson police department didn’t go home
    at night to Ferguson. They went to their suburbs, far away from
    Ferguson. They didn’t actually live in the community they policed.
    And after the Dallas shootings, the five officers in Dallas were
    shot, I remember that Dallas police chief said, like, if you want to
    change, we’re hiring. Get off the protest line. And come in —

  - scott watson  
    Come on in.

  - lynsea garrison  
    — to the police department. Yeah. Yeah.

  - scott watson  
    That’s true.

  - lynsea garrison  
    And is that true, though? Is that the thing that will change? Or
    would you get a flood of Black police officers who are, I don’t
    know, divided from the white officers. Then you’d have these two
    departments instead of this one department. And that would limit the
    change that those Black officers could bring.

  - scott watson  
    I mean, that’s a very tough question.
    
    I don’t know. I don’t have a definitive answer for that. But I will
    say this.
    
    I just went to the park not too long ago. And I had a basketball, a
    brand new basketball that was sitting around my house that I had
    bought for my son. And I went to this one park. And I’m like, you
    know what? I’m going to just go out there and just get me some shots
    up. And just kick it with the people that I know, you know? And when
    I’m done, I’m going to let them keep this basketball. So when they
    have good games going on or whatever, you know, they’ll have a
    really good basketball to use. You know it will be the park
    basketball. But it’s little things like that. But that’s just me.
    You know? That’s just me.

michael barbaro

In a statement to The Times, the City of Flint acknowledged that the
police department had received complaints about Facebook posts made by
police officers, and said that each of the complaints was investigated
and quote, “appropriately handled.” They also noted that the department
has recently launched a special recruitment effort to hire more officers
who are from Flint. The city has also hired a new chief of police,
Terence Green, who was himself born and raised in Flint. Green has said
that addressing the morale of officers is among his first priorities
coming into office. He begins his post tomorrow.

We’ll be right back.

Over the weekend, a man affiliated with a right-wing group was shot and
killed in Portland, Oregon during a confrontation between supporters of
President Trump and demonstrators protesting police brutality.

The pro-Trump supporters had staged a rally that involved driving
through downtown Portland where they clashed with protesters who have
demonstrated there for months since the police killing of George Floyd.

The man who was shot and killed was wearing a hat with the insignia of
Patriot Prayer, a far right group based in the Portland area that has
clashed with protesters in the past. President Trump, who has repeatedly
highlighted the unrest in Portland in his re-election campaign, said it
was the latest evidence that Democratic-run cities are out of control.
In a tweet defending his supporters, the president wrote, quote, “The
big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected.” In response,
his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, accused the president of quote,
“recklessly encouraging violence.”

*This episode contains strong language.*

As a police officer in his hometown of Flint, Mich., Scott Watson has
worked to become a pillar of the community, believing his identity has
placed him in a unique position to do his job. He has given out his
cellphone number, driven students to prom and provided food and money to
those who were hungry.

After watching the video of the killing of George Floyd, his identity as
a Black police officer became a source of self-consciousness instead of
pride.
