  scott watson\\
  Have you ever --- have you ever looked at, like, the state police
  graduating classes? OK. Do me a favor. Go back and look at their
  classes, their graduating classes. See how many Black people you see.

  We need our police departments to mirror the communities that we are
  serving. And we need those officers to come from within those
  communities. That'll make the change. When people start seeing we
  really and truly care from our hearts, people will see police in a
  different way.

From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  So of course it is disturbing, the number of African-Americans that
  are killed by police. And you know, this is raising a conversation, a
  number of questions about what are the issues that need to be tackled
  within police departments. And one of the things that comes up has to
  do with hiring practices and diversity.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

There's a growing consensus that to change American policing, police
departments must look more like the communities they serve.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  I think to many looking in from the outside, it's hard to understand
  how the police force could be majority white and the community
  majority African-American. Why can there --- how can there be such a
  disconnect or a discrepancy between the two?
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Today:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  We're hiring. We're hiring.

  Get off that protest line and put an application in. And we'll put you
  in your neighborhood. And we will help you resolve some of the
  problems you protesting about.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

The Daily's Lynsea Garrison spoke with one officer in Flint, Michigan
about his experience serving the community he grew up in.

It's Monday, August 31.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  OK. So press that button. And then try talking. Do you see little wavs
  ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So, I called up Scott Watson.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  OK. I'm talking into the actual phone now.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He was on duty the night we talked. So he left his police scanner on
just in case he got a call.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  I'm --- I'm ready as I'll ever going to be.

  So my name is Scott Watson. I'm from --- born and raised in Flint,
  Michigan. 53-year-old Black male. And I've been a city of Flint police
  officer for the past 23 years.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And Scott's story begins in 1966.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  So my mom had me when she was 16.

  So you can imagine, you know, having a child at 16 back then wasn't
  --- you know, it wasn't easy. Coming from a single-parent household,
  honestly, I mean, we struggled.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Scott and his mom, they move into the lower level of her brother's
house. It's in this neighborhood called St. John's, which is just on the
edge of the Buick car plant.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  It was still segregated for the most part.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And Scott's mom had a job at Sears.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  You know, I was a loner child. And my mom never had to, like, get me
  up for school and get me dressed. From tot lot on, you know, I could
  get myself up and get myself together. I didn't require much.

  You know, my mom's very nice. You know, she did the best she could.
  But she was in love. She was in love with, basically, a bad boy. You
  know, high school, he was one of the stud football players. But he
  liked the streets.

  You know, so he ended up going to prison.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And he says as a child, he didn't think much about his dad.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  My first real memory of him was going to Jackson prison and visiting
  him. It was just --- we went somewhere to visit a man that I really
  didn't know who, you know, come to find out was my dad.

  But at some point within the next couple of years, you know, he got
  out of prison. And that's where really my experiences --- learning, I
  guess learning more about me began.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

When his dad comes home from prison, it totally changes Scott's life.

{[}music{]}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  You know, he sold drugs. And I would --- I didn't have a bedroom. So I
  slept on the couch in the living room. You know, it was nothing for me
  to see strange people in the house all the time, people knocking on
  the door the wee hours of the morning to buy drugs. You know, I walked
  in the bathroom, I would see people shooting up heroin. That's what my
  dad was addicted to, heroin. I could open up a bathroom door, I would
  see pieces of rubber that they used to tie it off. Needles, needles
  with blood on them. At a very young age, I knew the difference between
  --- boy was heroin and girl was cocaine. You know, we kept it in the
  basement in the washing machine and in the dryer. I mean, you know,
  there with guns in every corner of the house. I had an opportunity to
  see it all. Things that, you know, kids shouldn't know. But I was
  never one of those kids who would touch any of that stuff.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And Scott's dad, he barely acknowledges Scott. He kind of treats Scott
like he's not even there.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I mean, this is kind of bad to say. But you know, he would take me to
  the drug houses. And he would leave me there. And he would leave with
  his friends. Or they would talk about drug activity right in front of
  me. And his friends would kind of look, like, you know, should we be
  doing this? And he would just tell them, aww, man, you don't have to
  worry. He ain't gonna say nothing. And he was right. I would never ---
  I would never say anything about his business. You know, you have to
  remember back in those days, kids stayed in a kid's place. So you know
  that was all --- that was all adult stuff. But I took it all in.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

The only time his dad really does pay attention to Scott is when he
brings him into the business.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So back then, you know, a lot of people were on assistance. You had
  first of the month, people would get their checks. And him and his
  friends, they would go in people's mailbox and take their checks, male
  or female. And you know, I can remember my dad dressing up like a lady
  and taking me with him to the bank to cash the check. And it looked
  good, you know, having a, you know, a little kid with you. But it's
  like --- it's like, wow. And it seemed like I'm talking more about my
  dad. Because most of the negativity --- the negativity and the
  positivity actually kind of comes from him. Because I wanted to be
  everything that he wasn't.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

That drive, Scott says, it motivates him in his quiet way. He keeps on
with school and his homework. He makes himself something to eat,
sometimes just ketchup sandwiches for lunch or dinner. And every free
moment he has, he pours himself into his escape: basketball.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}SPORTS ANNOUNCER SPEAKING{]}
\item
  scott watson\\
  It was the escape for me. I mean, day and night, if there was
  something basketball-related on TV, I watched it.
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Hoo.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  You saw it.
\item
  scott watson\\
  The Harlem Globetrotters used to have a variety show back then. So I
  would start learning how to do little tricks and drills and stuff and
  just got good at it.
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]} is trying to keep the game under control.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He takes his basketball literally everywhere with him. He even sleeps
with it.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Like some kids had teddy bears and stuff, I didn't have any of that. I
  had a basketball. Basketball was my best friend. As I got older, it
  was my girlfriend. It was my woman. It's, like, nothing else, you
  know, really nothing else mattered to me other than to be the best. So
  it took me away from all the negative things that were happening
  around me.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And while Scott is outside spending these hours on the street and, you
know, just in his everyday life going to school, he sees police officers
everywhere. They're doing community policing in his neighborhood then.
They're doing foot patrol while he's growing up.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Actually, a friend of mine, his sister, she was on the police
  department.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He knows several of his friends whose family are police officers.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So they were pretty much positive role models when I was coming up.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Even the times when police officers were called into his house for
various domestic disputes between his father and his mother, even then,
he didn't have a negative perception of the police. He didn't really
fault the police in those moments.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I mean, they weren't nasty or abusive --- speaking of the police. At
  the time, they just tried to get the problem solved. So I didn't think
  anything bad about them. Like, say it was more a reflection on my mom
  and dad.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So those were mostly good experiences. But then Scott turns 13.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  And then this would be a negative experience. A friend of mine, his
  name was Billy. He was, like, 15. He was not a bad kid. He was just
  kind of mischievous, you know? Just kind of a mischievous kid. But him
  and some more guys broke into a house. And the police showed up. And
  Billy took off running out the backdoor and went to jump a fence. And
  a white police officer shot him in the back of the head with his
  shotgun. Killed him. And that touched off some real tensions. You
  know, people were starting to riot. So that was kind of my first bout
  with kind of like some perceived racism. You know, white police
  officer, Black kid, you know, you shot a young Black boy in the head
  who was running away from a property crime. You know? And you killed
  him. And now I'm angry. But at the same time, I was like, man, Billy
  was wrong. He broke into somebody's house or whatever. So he
  definitely didn't deserve that. But you know, he was wrong.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Over the next couple of years, Scott kind of starts to drift off. His
grandmother dies, which hits him really hard. And he stops playing
basketball. He starts skipping school. Even if he attends class, he
doesn't really engage. He just sits there quietly. And his G.P.A. ends
up falling to a 0.6. And then two things happen.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So a guy that I was hanging out with, we were skipping school one day.
  And he had a car. And we were going down the highway and we were doing
  over 100 miles an hour. And a semi-truck was in the lane next to us
  and got over in front of us.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

This humongous semi moves suddenly right in front of their car. And
Scott's friend in the driver's seat has to just quickly slam on the
brakes. The car skids.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  --- brakes. And we almost --- I mean, we were right, right up his
  bumper. About to hit it right in the back. And I just see my life
  flash before my eyes. And I'm, like, woo! I mean, it scared me to
  death.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So that happened.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So after that, about a week later, the friend that I was with, he was
  killed. And he was killed by some of my other friends. They got into
  it over a gold chain or something. And they did a drive by and they
  killed him. So he's dead. And some of my friends, they ended up going
  to prison.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And then Scott, he just has this realization. Like, if I don't make some
changes here, the same kind of future is waiting for me.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  And after that happened, it's like, all right. This is God's way of
  telling me you got to get your life together. Because nothing good is
  going to come out of that. So ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And so he does.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I just start going to school every day and started doing my work.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He starts playing basketball again and going to school. And eventually,
he gets spotted by this basketball coach at a junior college in Flint
who's looking for undiscovered players.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  He took me in like I was his son. And I brought a couple of other guys
  along. That was kind of ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And while he's playing there, he's noticed, again, by Northern Colorado
University. And they offer him a scholarship.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I got a full ride scholarship for basketball.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So Scott moves from Flint, Michigan to Greeley, Colorado. And he has to
pick a major.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  I knew it from the other side first, by all the criminal activity and
  stuff I'd seen as a little kid. And I mean, I knew --- you know, I
  knew about the drug game and the time you could get for committing
  certain crimes. And unknowingly, being a part of crimes ---
  {[}LAUGHS{]} --- sometimes, you know, as a little kid.

  Criminal justice, it just came easy for me. It was natural for me.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And when he graduates, his career choice seems like a natural one, too.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  In my mind, everything my dad was, I wanted to be the total opposite.
  So once I was honest with myself and evaluated who I am and knowing
  what I'm capable of, it was easy. It was easy.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And so he returns home to Flint and enrolls in the police academy there.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  You know, I just kind of went from there.
\end{itemize}

{[}music{]}

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

lynsea garrison

So Scott moves back home to Flint. And he enrolls in the Flint police
academy. And he says that when he enrolls, at this time in the mid-`90s,
there's this huge push for police officers of color. The current police
chief at the time is Black. And he's really trying to increase the
number of Black police officers in that department. And Scott really
wants to be a part of that.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  Now my mom was just like, a police officer? You don't look like a
  police officer. So I'm explaining to her, I'm like, so what? What does
  a police officer look like? And she really didn't have --- she just
  knew it didn't look like me. So you know, I'm like, wow. OK. But I
  know me. And who better to protect my community than me?
\item
  {[}police radio in background{]}
\item
  scott watson\\
  So my first day on the road, we hit the ground running. I think my
  first night on the road, we ran, like, 50 radio calls.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So Scott says they're responding to these calls, him and these two
supervisors he's with. And it's like, every call they respond to, Scott
knows everyone. And these white officers are like ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Man. Every call we go on, you know, I think I impressed my training
  officers. Because every call that we went on, the people know me. And
  I'm just, like, hey, you know? I grew up here. I play sports here. So
  yeah, I know a lot of people.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And for Scott, it was this call to duty is being validated on his very
first day of the job.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  I don't think there's anybody better to do that job than myself.
\item
  archived recording\\
  (POLICE RADIO) 10-4.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

But then, in his first year ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I was out of training. I was working by myself. And an officer got in
  a chase trying to stop a vehicle.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Scott is called in to help pursue a Black suspect who fled during a
traffic stop. So the suspect got out of his vehicle. And he took off
running through the yard. Now this is wintertime. When I say winter, I
mean, it is freezing outside, freezing cold. And it had been snowing a
lot. So here in Michigan, we don't shovel our backyards or whatever. So
the snow is high. So anyway, this guy he jumps out his vehicle. And he
takes off running. And he runs through these people's yard. And he tries
to jump a wooden fence and the fence breaks. He doesn't have a coat on
or anything. And he lands in all this heavy snow. And Scott gets out of
his car. And he's walking up to the scene.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  And all these white officers showed up. And they all kick snow on him.
  Kick snow on his face, on his head. And it made my heart drop. So I
  just --- I walked --- I stepped right in between all of them. Picked
  him up. Brushed the snow off of him. Handcuffed him. Put him in the
  backseat of my car. And I cut the heat on. And I transport him to the
  station.
\end{itemize}

{[}music{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  And it's funny because he wasn't --- the suspect wasn't mad.

  You just kind of got the feeling from him that, you know, this just
  business. Like, this is how it's supposed to be. And I've never
  experienced that until then. And I'm like, this is not how it's
  supposed to be. I think I was more hurt than he was. I mean, he was
  glad that I was there to pick him up and you know, he was so
  appreciative of, you know, I hate to say it like this. But seeing that
  Black face that --- it's, like, you know, OK, I'm safe. You know? I'm
  safe. He took care of me. He's not going to let anything else happen
  to me.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

But Scott can't really get over what he saw.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  At that moment, that made me question what's really going on here. It
  made me, like, is this something I really want to be a part of?
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He keeps thinking about that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  In that moment, it made me rethink it. But actually, that had to make
  my resolve greater. Because it showed me, it's like, we need more like
  me and less like that. In the big picture, I need to stay.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Scott continues to work in patrol for a number of years. And then he
moves on to this special squad where he's investigating drugs and gangs
on the streets of Flint. And as he gets further and further into his
career on the force, he kind of grows to believe that he can be a force
for good in all of these smaller ways.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  They have block clubs and stuff on the North end of Flint. I would go
  to the block club meetings. I wasn't getting paid. I wasn't on the
  police dime. Take kids to the prom for free, so they'll have a nice
  prom experience. You know, I'll see somebody who's hungry, I'll go in
  my pocket and give them money so they can get something to eat.
  People, they can always reach me by my cell phone. Or you know, go get
  the food for them. Because I don't buy cigarettes or alcohol for them.
  You know, they have my number. They can pick up the phone and call me
  and I can take care of the problems. I'm always trying to help people
  out with their issues.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

In 2006, after Scott is in the department for nearly a decade, something
happens in Flint.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  The Black pastors complain that there wasn't enough minorities in the
  upper administrative positions in the police department. It didn't
  reflect our community. So the Black pastors wanted --- it was a white
  mayor. They wanted him to do something about it.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And you know, it's an interesting time in the police department. Because
it's almost equal parts white officers and equal parts Black officers.
Scott said that basically the Black officers that were recruited by the
Black police chief in the `90s, back when Scott joined, a lot of those
officers were still around. But what the pastors were complaining about
was that hardly any of those Black officers were in positions of
command. The captains, the lieutenants, the sergeants, all the way up to
the chief, those positions were overwhelmingly white.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So the Black pastors wanted --- it was a white mayor --- they wanted
  him to do something about it. So he came up with the idea of having a
  group of officers outside of the regular ranks be above everybody in
  the regular ranks. And they were called a citizen's service bureau.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And then he promotes four Black officers into that group.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  But there was no rhyme or reason how he chose these people. There was
  no testing. There was no nothing. This is just who he wanted.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Almost immediately, the police unions respond.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  The white officers in the department got together with the union and
  filed a lawsuit. And it was a reverse discrimination lawsuit.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

More than 40 officers file a reverse discrimination lawsuit, complaining
that the mayor had no basis for those promotions. He didn't follow any
procedure. And he overlooked qualified white officers in those
promotions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Well, the Black officers were like, well, hold up here. You know, this
  is unfair to us. If there is no testing procedure, you know, it
  affects us also. And it's, like, wow. So long story short, all the
  white officers, the lowest amount of money they got was like \$25,000.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

The white officers actually win the case. The city loses millions of
dollars. And Scott is feeling totally blindsided.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  It felt like, honestly, us against them at that point. You know, when
  you see all the white officers band together, and basically we were
  --- the Black officers were kept out. And it's, like, uh, we're not
  one. I mean --- so yeah. There's you guys over here and us over here.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And that's pretty much how Scott comes to think about the department. As
two departments.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So for us Blacks, we're like, wow. You know, y'all walk around here
  preaching, you know, thin blue line, and we're all brothers. But I
  think people --- they had a thin blue line kind of wrong. Within that
  thin blue line is a racial divide also. And that's the part that I
  don't think people see. We smile in each other's faces. But you know,
  in the back of your mind, when the chips are down, there's a division.
  And you can tell, in their circles, when it's just them, it's a lot
  different than when they're around us.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

This all comes into greater focus for Scott with the killing of George
Floyd.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So initially, someone was telling me about it. But I hadn't seen the
  video. So maybe a day or two after it happened, I seen the video. And
  I was --- it hurt me to my core. To my core.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Suddenly, his identity as a Black officer, rather than feeling like a
source of pride, it turns into a source of self-consciousness.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  Right after this, after I seen the video, I came to work. Oh my gosh.
  I was embarrassed to put a uniform on. I was embarrassed to get out of
  my cruiser. I stopped at --- one of the guys who barbecue on the
  street, you know, and I stopped to get something to eat. And I just
  felt --- I really felt like I didn't belong. The embarrassment that I
  felt and people looking at me, like, you know, there go one of them
  right there. You know? That's what I felt. And I just wanted to stay
  out the way. I didn't want to make no traffic stops.

  That night, after the stuff happened, it's about 2 o'clock in the
  morning. And I'm in a semi-marked car. And I'm riding down the main
  street. But it's pretty much empty. And this car fly, they fly by me.
  And so I pull them over. I got lights and sirens and stuff. So I pull
  them over. And I walk up to the car. And I'm just as polite, and it
  was a male and a female. And the male was driving, a Black couple. I'm
  like, you know, your license, registration, proof of insurance, and
  whatever. And I asked him if he knew why I stopped him. Oh. I mean, he
  was so disrespectful to me and just talking about how we don't do
  nothing but kill people. And I mean, he was cussing at me. And I still
  just kept my composure. I'm like, OK. He mad. They're mad. I get it. I
  understand. What they don't understand is I'm mad also.

  So I ran his name and everything. He had a good driver's license and
  everything. Didn't write him a ticket or anything. And I just walked
  back up to his car and I gave him his stuff back. And I told him,
  y'all have a good night. And after I said that, he couldn't respond.
  It's almost like he couldn't believe. Like man, he didn't cuss me out
  or anything. But I was hurt. But I kind of had to just hide it.

  Honestly, it's just been feeling like everybody is against you. I
  mean, your own people call you Uncle Tom, sellout. And then you got
  your white counterparts who, you know ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Again, Scott is having this feeling that there are these conversations
going on in the office that he's not really a part of. He says in the
conversations that he's hearing, everyone is flatly condemning what
happened to George Floyd. But then he goes on Facebook.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  {[}SIGHS{]} You know, there's been some things, social media post by
  officers, white officers, that were less than ---

  it made officers feel some type of way, specifically our Black
  officers.

  I don't even know how to really approach the subject. But we have some
  officers, some young white officers who made some statements on social
  media.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

This is what Scott said he saw.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  We felt were inappropriate.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He reads one post from a white colleague that said George Floyd was a
piece of shit and a criminal.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  --- said he was a criminal.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And then he reads another comment from a white supervisor who writes
that ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Wow.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

--- there must have been a big fight before that happened.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  It really rubbed me the wrong way. But I was ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Another white colleague reposted a picture that said, ``Only in America
can an ethnic group have Black awareness month, a Black holiday, Black
only colleges, Black only dating sites, Black only bars and clubs, and
turn around and call everyone else racists.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  But these are colleagues that you probably see every day?
\item
  scott watson\\
  Yes. So it's always difficult when you know people feel like that in
  your heart.

  It's tough. So even now, you know, I still speak to them. And I still
  treat them the same because I was their supervisor.

  But did it make me feel some type of way? Yes. And did it make other
  Black officers feel some type of way? Absolutely.

  Can you truly protect and serve the people where you work if that's
  how you truly feel?
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  Do you think, Scott, you've been able to make a difference in
  policing?
\item
  scott watson\\
  {[}SIGHS{]} It probably depends on which day you talk to me.
  {[}LAUGHING{]} Some days --- you know, I try to help people every day.
  And I help a lot of people. You know, I get calls from jails and
  prisons all the time, and attorneys and prosecutors and victims. And
  you know, so I look at individual things where I've been able to help
  people in one way or another. And I'll take those as wins. But when I
  look at the overall career and where we were at when I came on the
  department and where we're at now, it doesn't feel like a win.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  What's that feel like?
\item
  scott watson\\
  Crap. It makes you feel like --- it makes you feel like crap. I don't
  want to say it's been wasted. But if we, as Black officers haven't
  changed the minds and hearts of our white officers, it just don't feel
  like a win.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  Hm.
\item
  scott watson\\
  So where do we go from here? Where do I go from here?

  I'm trying to get my mojo back. But I keep seeing the same stuff.

  I haven't seen change. I haven't seen real change yet.

  But I'm going to retire. And I'm going to go off into the sunset. I
  hate to retire in a sense, because who replaces me? Will it be someone
  not from our community?

  So the real answer is, I don't know.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  I guess I'm still wondering, and I don't mean to belabor this point.
  But you hear so much about recruiting more Black officers as one of
  the solutions for reform. And I feel like this kind of call for
  diversity happens each time. I mean, when Michael Brown was shot, a
  big criticism was that the Ferguson police department didn't go home
  at night to Ferguson. They went to their suburbs, far away from
  Ferguson. They didn't actually live in the community they policed. And
  after the Dallas shootings, the five officers in Dallas were shot, I
  remember that Dallas police chief said, like, if you want to change,
  we're hiring. Get off the protest line. And come in ---
\item
  scott watson\\
  Come on in.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  --- to the police department. Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  scott watson\\
  That's true.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  And is that true, though? Is that the thing that will change? Or would
  you get a flood of Black police officers who are, I don't know,
  divided from the white officers. Then you'd have these two departments
  instead of this one department. And that would limit the change that
  those Black officers could bring.
\item
  scott watson\\
  I mean, that's a very tough question.

  I don't know. I don't have a definitive answer for that. But I will
  say this.

  I just went to the park not too long ago. And I had a basketball, a
  brand new basketball that was sitting around my house that I had
  bought for my son. And I went to this one park. And I'm like, you know
  what? I'm going to just go out there and just get me some shots up.
  And just kick it with the people that I know, you know? And when I'm
  done, I'm going to let them keep this basketball. So when they have
  good games going on or whatever, you know, they'll have a really good
  basketball to use. You know it will be the park basketball. But it's
  little things like that. But that's just me. You know? That's just me.

In a statement to The Times, the City of Flint acknowledged that the
police department had received complaints about Facebook posts made by
police officers, and said that each of the complaints was investigated
and quote, ``appropriately handled.'' They also noted that the
department has recently launched a special recruitment effort to hire
more officers who are from Flint. The city has also hired a new chief of
police, Terence Green, who was himself born and raised in Flint. Green
has said that addressing the morale of officers is among his first
priorities coming into office. He begins his post tomorrow.

We'll be right back.

The man who was shot and killed was wearing a hat with the insignia of
Patriot Prayer, a far right group based in the Portland area that has
clashed with protesters in the past. President Trump, who has repeatedly
highlighted the unrest in Portland in his re-election campaign, said it
was the latest evidence that Democratic-run cities are out of control.
In a tweet defending his supporters, the president wrote, quote, ``The
big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected.'' In response,
his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, accused the president of quote,
``recklessly encouraging violence.''

  Have you ever --- have you ever looked at, like, the state police
  graduating classes? OK. Do me a favor. Go back and look at their
  classes, their graduating classes. See how many Black people you see.

  We need our police departments to mirror the communities that we are
  serving. And we need those officers to come from within those
  communities. That'll make the change. When people start seeing we
  really and truly care from our hearts, people will see police in a
  different way.

From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''

  So of course it is disturbing, the number of African-Americans that
  are killed by police. And you know, this is raising a conversation, a
  number of questions about what are the issues that need to be tackled
  within police departments. And one of the things that comes up has to
  do with hiring practices and diversity.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

There's a growing consensus that to change American policing, police
departments must look more like the communities they serve.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording\\
  I think to many looking in from the outside, it's hard to understand
  how the police force could be majority white and the community
  majority African-American. Why can there --- how can there be such a
  disconnect or a discrepancy between the two?
\end{itemize}

Today:

\begin{itemize}
\item

  We're hiring. We're hiring.

  Get off that protest line and put an application in. And we'll put you
  in your neighborhood. And we will help you resolve some of the
  problems you protesting about.

The Daily's Lynsea Garrison spoke with one officer in Flint, Michigan
about his experience serving the community he grew up in.

It's Monday, August 31.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  OK. So press that button. And then try talking. Do you see little wavs
  ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So, I called up Scott Watson.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  OK. I'm talking into the actual phone now.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He was on duty the night we talked. So he left his police scanner on
just in case he got a call.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  I'm --- I'm ready as I'll ever going to be.

  So my name is Scott Watson. I'm from --- born and raised in Flint,
  Michigan. 53-year-old Black male. And I've been a city of Flint police
  officer for the past 23 years.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And Scott's story begins in 1966.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  So my mom had me when she was 16.

  So you can imagine, you know, having a child at 16 back then wasn't
  --- you know, it wasn't easy. Coming from a single-parent household,
  honestly, I mean, we struggled.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Scott and his mom, they move into the lower level of her brother's
house. It's in this neighborhood called St. John's, which is just on the
edge of the Buick car plant.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  It was still segregated for the most part.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And Scott's mom had a job at Sears.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  You know, I was a loner child. And my mom never had to, like, get me
  up for school and get me dressed. From tot lot on, you know, I could
  get myself up and get myself together. I didn't require much.

  You know, my mom's very nice. You know, she did the best she could.
  But she was in love. She was in love with, basically, a bad boy. You
  know, high school, he was one of the stud football players. But he
  liked the streets.

  You know, so he ended up going to prison.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And he says as a child, he didn't think much about his dad.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  My first real memory of him was going to Jackson prison and visiting
  him. It was just --- we went somewhere to visit a man that I really
  didn't know who, you know, come to find out was my dad.

  But at some point within the next couple of years, you know, he got
  out of prison. And that's where really my experiences --- learning, I
  guess learning more about me began.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

When his dad comes home from prison, it totally changes Scott's life.

{[}music{]}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  You know, he sold drugs. And I would --- I didn't have a bedroom. So I
  slept on the couch in the living room. You know, it was nothing for me
  to see strange people in the house all the time, people knocking on
  the door the wee hours of the morning to buy drugs. You know, I walked
  in the bathroom, I would see people shooting up heroin. That's what my
  dad was addicted to, heroin. I could open up a bathroom door, I would
  see pieces of rubber that they used to tie it off. Needles, needles
  with blood on them. At a very young age, I knew the difference between
  --- boy was heroin and girl was cocaine. You know, we kept it in the
  basement in the washing machine and in the dryer. I mean, you know,
  there with guns in every corner of the house. I had an opportunity to
  see it all. Things that, you know, kids shouldn't know. But I was
  never one of those kids who would touch any of that stuff.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And Scott's dad, he barely acknowledges Scott. He kind of treats Scott
like he's not even there.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I mean, this is kind of bad to say. But you know, he would take me to
  the drug houses. And he would leave me there. And he would leave with
  his friends. Or they would talk about drug activity right in front of
  me. And his friends would kind of look, like, you know, should we be
  doing this? And he would just tell them, aww, man, you don't have to
  worry. He ain't gonna say nothing. And he was right. I would never ---
  I would never say anything about his business. You know, you have to
  remember back in those days, kids stayed in a kid's place. So you know
  that was all --- that was all adult stuff. But I took it all in.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

The only time his dad really does pay attention to Scott is when he
brings him into the business.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So back then, you know, a lot of people were on assistance. You had
  first of the month, people would get their checks. And him and his
  friends, they would go in people's mailbox and take their checks, male
  or female. And you know, I can remember my dad dressing up like a lady
  and taking me with him to the bank to cash the check. And it looked
  good, you know, having a, you know, a little kid with you. But it's
  like --- it's like, wow. And it seemed like I'm talking more about my
  dad. Because most of the negativity --- the negativity and the
  positivity actually kind of comes from him. Because I wanted to be
  everything that he wasn't.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

That drive, Scott says, it motivates him in his quiet way. He keeps on
with school and his homework. He makes himself something to eat,
sometimes just ketchup sandwiches for lunch or dinner. And every free
moment he has, he pours himself into his escape: basketball.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}SPORTS ANNOUNCER SPEAKING{]}
\item
  scott watson\\
  It was the escape for me. I mean, day and night, if there was
  something basketball-related on TV, I watched it.
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Hoo.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  You saw it.
\item
  scott watson\\
  The Harlem Globetrotters used to have a variety show back then. So I
  would start learning how to do little tricks and drills and stuff and
  just got good at it.
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]} is trying to keep the game under control.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He takes his basketball literally everywhere with him. He even sleeps
with it.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Like some kids had teddy bears and stuff, I didn't have any of that. I
  had a basketball. Basketball was my best friend. As I got older, it
  was my girlfriend. It was my woman. It's, like, nothing else, you
  know, really nothing else mattered to me other than to be the best. So
  it took me away from all the negative things that were happening
  around me.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And while Scott is outside spending these hours on the street and, you
know, just in his everyday life going to school, he sees police officers
everywhere. They're doing community policing in his neighborhood then.
They're doing foot patrol while he's growing up.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Actually, a friend of mine, his sister, she was on the police
  department.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He knows several of his friends whose family are police officers.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So they were pretty much positive role models when I was coming up.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Even the times when police officers were called into his house for
various domestic disputes between his father and his mother, even then,
he didn't have a negative perception of the police. He didn't really
fault the police in those moments.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I mean, they weren't nasty or abusive --- speaking of the police. At
  the time, they just tried to get the problem solved. So I didn't think
  anything bad about them. Like, say it was more a reflection on my mom
  and dad.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So those were mostly good experiences. But then Scott turns 13.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  And then this would be a negative experience. A friend of mine, his
  name was Billy. He was, like, 15. He was not a bad kid. He was just
  kind of mischievous, you know? Just kind of a mischievous kid. But him
  and some more guys broke into a house. And the police showed up. And
  Billy took off running out the backdoor and went to jump a fence. And
  a white police officer shot him in the back of the head with his
  shotgun. Killed him. And that touched off some real tensions. You
  know, people were starting to riot. So that was kind of my first bout
  with kind of like some perceived racism. You know, white police
  officer, Black kid, you know, you shot a young Black boy in the head
  who was running away from a property crime. You know? And you killed
  him. And now I'm angry. But at the same time, I was like, man, Billy
  was wrong. He broke into somebody's house or whatever. So he
  definitely didn't deserve that. But you know, he was wrong.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Over the next couple of years, Scott kind of starts to drift off. His
grandmother dies, which hits him really hard. And he stops playing
basketball. He starts skipping school. Even if he attends class, he
doesn't really engage. He just sits there quietly. And his G.P.A. ends
up falling to a 0.6. And then two things happen.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So a guy that I was hanging out with, we were skipping school one day.
  And he had a car. And we were going down the highway and we were doing
  over 100 miles an hour. And a semi-truck was in the lane next to us
  and got over in front of us.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

This humongous semi moves suddenly right in front of their car. And
Scott's friend in the driver's seat has to just quickly slam on the
brakes. The car skids.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  --- brakes. And we almost --- I mean, we were right, right up his
  bumper. About to hit it right in the back. And I just see my life
  flash before my eyes. And I'm, like, woo! I mean, it scared me to
  death.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So that happened.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So after that, about a week later, the friend that I was with, he was
  killed. And he was killed by some of my other friends. They got into
  it over a gold chain or something. And they did a drive by and they
  killed him. So he's dead. And some of my friends, they ended up going
  to prison.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And then Scott, he just has this realization. Like, if I don't make some
changes here, the same kind of future is waiting for me.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  And after that happened, it's like, all right. This is God's way of
  telling me you got to get your life together. Because nothing good is
  going to come out of that. So ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And so he does.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I just start going to school every day and started doing my work.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He starts playing basketball again and going to school. And eventually,
he gets spotted by this basketball coach at a junior college in Flint
who's looking for undiscovered players.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  He took me in like I was his son. And I brought a couple of other guys
  along. That was kind of ---
\end{itemize}

And while he's playing there, he's noticed, again, by Northern Colorado
University. And they offer him a scholarship.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I got a full ride scholarship for basketball.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So Scott moves from Flint, Michigan to Greeley, Colorado. And he has to
pick a major.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  I knew it from the other side first, by all the criminal activity and
  stuff I'd seen as a little kid. And I mean, I knew --- you know, I
  knew about the drug game and the time you could get for committing
  certain crimes. And unknowingly, being a part of crimes ---
  {[}LAUGHS{]} --- sometimes, you know, as a little kid.

  Criminal justice, it just came easy for me. It was natural for me.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And when he graduates, his career choice seems like a natural one, too.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  In my mind, everything my dad was, I wanted to be the total opposite.
  So once I was honest with myself and evaluated who I am and knowing
  what I'm capable of, it was easy. It was easy.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And so he returns home to Flint and enrolls in the police academy there.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  You know, I just kind of went from there.
\end{itemize}

We'll be right back.

lynsea garrison

So Scott moves back home to Flint. And he enrolls in the Flint police
academy. And he says that when he enrolls, at this time in the mid-`90s,
there's this huge push for police officers of color. The current police
chief at the time is Black. And he's really trying to increase the
number of Black police officers in that department. And Scott really
wants to be a part of that.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  Now my mom was just like, a police officer? You don't look like a
  police officer. So I'm explaining to her, I'm like, so what? What does
  a police officer look like? And she really didn't have --- she just
  knew it didn't look like me. So you know, I'm like, wow. OK. But I
  know me. And who better to protect my community than me?
\item
  {[}police radio in background{]}
\item
  scott watson\\
  So my first day on the road, we hit the ground running. I think my
  first night on the road, we ran, like, 50 radio calls.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

So Scott says they're responding to these calls, him and these two
supervisors he's with. And it's like, every call they respond to, Scott
knows everyone. And these white officers are like ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Man. Every call we go on, you know, I think I impressed my training
  officers. Because every call that we went on, the people know me. And
  I'm just, like, hey, you know? I grew up here. I play sports here. So
  yeah, I know a lot of people.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And for Scott, it was this call to duty is being validated on his very
first day of the job.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  I don't think there's anybody better to do that job than myself.
\item

  (POLICE RADIO) 10-4.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

But then, in his first year ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  I was out of training. I was working by myself. And an officer got in
  a chase trying to stop a vehicle.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Scott is called in to help pursue a Black suspect who fled during a
traffic stop. So the suspect got out of his vehicle. And he took off
running through the yard. Now this is wintertime. When I say winter, I
mean, it is freezing outside, freezing cold. And it had been snowing a
lot. So here in Michigan, we don't shovel our backyards or whatever. So
the snow is high. So anyway, this guy he jumps out his vehicle. And he
takes off running. And he runs through these people's yard. And he tries
to jump a wooden fence and the fence breaks. He doesn't have a coat on
or anything. And he lands in all this heavy snow. And Scott gets out of
his car. And he's walking up to the scene.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  And all these white officers showed up. And they all kick snow on him.
  Kick snow on his face, on his head. And it made my heart drop. So I
  just --- I walked --- I stepped right in between all of them. Picked
  him up. Brushed the snow off of him. Handcuffed him. Put him in the
  backseat of my car. And I cut the heat on. And I transport him to the
  station.
\end{itemize}

{[}music{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  And it's funny because he wasn't --- the suspect wasn't mad.

  You just kind of got the feeling from him that, you know, this just
  business. Like, this is how it's supposed to be. And I've never
  experienced that until then. And I'm like, this is not how it's
  supposed to be. I think I was more hurt than he was. I mean, he was
  glad that I was there to pick him up and you know, he was so
  appreciative of, you know, I hate to say it like this. But seeing that
  Black face that --- it's, like, you know, OK, I'm safe. You know? I'm
  safe. He took care of me. He's not going to let anything else happen
  to me.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

But Scott can't really get over what he saw.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  At that moment, that made me question what's really going on here. It
  made me, like, is this something I really want to be a part of?
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He keeps thinking about that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  In that moment, it made me rethink it. But actually, that had to make
  my resolve greater. Because it showed me, it's like, we need more like
  me and less like that. In the big picture, I need to stay.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Scott continues to work in patrol for a number of years. And then he
moves on to this special squad where he's investigating drugs and gangs
on the streets of Flint. And as he gets further and further into his
career on the force, he kind of grows to believe that he can be a force
for good in all of these smaller ways.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  They have block clubs and stuff on the North end of Flint. I would go
  to the block club meetings. I wasn't getting paid. I wasn't on the
  police dime. Take kids to the prom for free, so they'll have a nice
  prom experience. You know, I'll see somebody who's hungry, I'll go in
  my pocket and give them money so they can get something to eat.
  People, they can always reach me by my cell phone. Or you know, go get
  the food for them. Because I don't buy cigarettes or alcohol for them.
  You know, they have my number. They can pick up the phone and call me
  and I can take care of the problems. I'm always trying to help people
  out with their issues.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

In 2006, after Scott is in the department for nearly a decade, something
happens in Flint.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  The Black pastors complain that there wasn't enough minorities in the
  upper administrative positions in the police department. It didn't
  reflect our community. So the Black pastors wanted --- it was a white
  mayor. They wanted him to do something about it.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And you know, it's an interesting time in the police department. Because
it's almost equal parts white officers and equal parts Black officers.
Scott said that basically the Black officers that were recruited by the
Black police chief in the `90s, back when Scott joined, a lot of those
officers were still around. But what the pastors were complaining about
was that hardly any of those Black officers were in positions of
command. The captains, the lieutenants, the sergeants, all the way up to
the chief, those positions were overwhelmingly white.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So the Black pastors wanted --- it was a white mayor --- they wanted
  him to do something about it. So he came up with the idea of having a
  group of officers outside of the regular ranks be above everybody in
  the regular ranks. And they were called a citizen's service bureau.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And then he promotes four Black officers into that group.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  But there was no rhyme or reason how he chose these people. There was
  no testing. There was no nothing. This is just who he wanted.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Almost immediately, the police unions respond.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  The white officers in the department got together with the union and
  filed a lawsuit. And it was a reverse discrimination lawsuit.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

More than 40 officers file a reverse discrimination lawsuit, complaining
that the mayor had no basis for those promotions. He didn't follow any
procedure. And he overlooked qualified white officers in those
promotions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Well, the Black officers were like, well, hold up here. You know, this
  is unfair to us. If there is no testing procedure, you know, it
  affects us also. And it's, like, wow. So long story short, all the
  white officers, the lowest amount of money they got was like \$25,000.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

The white officers actually win the case. The city loses millions of
dollars. And Scott is feeling totally blindsided.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  It felt like, honestly, us against them at that point. You know, when
  you see all the white officers band together, and basically we were
  --- the Black officers were kept out. And it's, like, uh, we're not
  one. I mean --- so yeah. There's you guys over here and us over here.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And that's pretty much how Scott comes to think about the department. As
two departments.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So for us Blacks, we're like, wow. You know, y'all walk around here
  preaching, you know, thin blue line, and we're all brothers. But I
  think people --- they had a thin blue line kind of wrong. Within that
  thin blue line is a racial divide also. And that's the part that I
  don't think people see. We smile in each other's faces. But you know,
  in the back of your mind, when the chips are down, there's a division.
  And you can tell, in their circles, when it's just them, it's a lot
  different than when they're around us.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

This all comes into greater focus for Scott with the killing of George
Floyd.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  So initially, someone was telling me about it. But I hadn't seen the
  video. So maybe a day or two after it happened, I seen the video. And
  I was --- it hurt me to my core. To my core.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Suddenly, his identity as a Black officer, rather than feeling like a
source of pride, it turns into a source of self-consciousness.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  Right after this, after I seen the video, I came to work. Oh my gosh.
  I was embarrassed to put a uniform on. I was embarrassed to get out of
  my cruiser. I stopped at --- one of the guys who barbecue on the
  street, you know, and I stopped to get something to eat. And I just
  felt --- I really felt like I didn't belong. The embarrassment that I
  felt and people looking at me, like, you know, there go one of them
  right there. You know? That's what I felt. And I just wanted to stay
  out the way. I didn't want to make no traffic stops.

  That night, after the stuff happened, it's about 2 o'clock in the
  morning. And I'm in a semi-marked car. And I'm riding down the main
  street. But it's pretty much empty. And this car fly, they fly by me.
  And so I pull them over. I got lights and sirens and stuff. So I pull
  them over. And I walk up to the car. And I'm just as polite, and it
  was a male and a female. And the male was driving, a Black couple. I'm
  like, you know, your license, registration, proof of insurance, and
  whatever. And I asked him if he knew why I stopped him. Oh. I mean, he
  was so disrespectful to me and just talking about how we don't do
  nothing but kill people. And I mean, he was cussing at me. And I still
  just kept my composure. I'm like, OK. He mad. They're mad. I get it. I
  understand. What they don't understand is I'm mad also.

  So I ran his name and everything. He had a good driver's license and
  everything. Didn't write him a ticket or anything. And I just walked
  back up to his car and I gave him his stuff back. And I told him,
  y'all have a good night. And after I said that, he couldn't respond.
  It's almost like he couldn't believe. Like man, he didn't cuss me out
  or anything. But I was hurt. But I kind of had to just hide it.

  Honestly, it's just been feeling like everybody is against you. I
  mean, your own people call you Uncle Tom, sellout. And then you got
  your white counterparts who, you know ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Again, Scott is having this feeling that there are these conversations
going on in the office that he's not really a part of. He says in the
conversations that he's hearing, everyone is flatly condemning what
happened to George Floyd. But then he goes on Facebook.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  scott watson\\
  {[}SIGHS{]} You know, there's been some things, social media post by
  officers, white officers, that were less than ---

  it made officers feel some type of way, specifically our Black
  officers.

  I don't even know how to really approach the subject. But we have some
  officers, some young white officers who made some statements on social
  media.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

This is what Scott said he saw.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  We felt were inappropriate.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

He reads one post from a white colleague that said George Floyd was a
piece of shit and a criminal.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  --- said he was a criminal.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

And then he reads another comment from a white supervisor who writes
that ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  Wow.
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

--- there must have been a big fight before that happened.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  scott watson\\
  It really rubbed me the wrong way. But I was ---
\end{itemize}

lynsea garrison

Another white colleague reposted a picture that said, ``Only in America
can an ethnic group have Black awareness month, a Black holiday, Black
only colleges, Black only dating sites, Black only bars and clubs, and
turn around and call everyone else racists.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  But these are colleagues that you probably see every day?
\item
  scott watson\\
  Yes. So it's always difficult when you know people feel like that in
  your heart.

  It's tough. So even now, you know, I still speak to them. And I still
  treat them the same because I was their supervisor.

  But did it make me feel some type of way? Yes. And did it make other
  Black officers feel some type of way? Absolutely.

  Can you truly protect and serve the people where you work if that's
  how you truly feel?
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  Do you think, Scott, you've been able to make a difference in
  policing?
\item
  scott watson\\
  {[}SIGHS{]} It probably depends on which day you talk to me.
  {[}LAUGHING{]} Some days --- you know, I try to help people every day.
  And I help a lot of people. You know, I get calls from jails and
  prisons all the time, and attorneys and prosecutors and victims. And
  you know, so I look at individual things where I've been able to help
  people in one way or another. And I'll take those as wins. But when I
  look at the overall career and where we were at when I came on the
  department and where we're at now, it doesn't feel like a win.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  What's that feel like?
\item
  scott watson\\
  Crap. It makes you feel like --- it makes you feel like crap. I don't
  want to say it's been wasted. But if we, as Black officers haven't
  changed the minds and hearts of our white officers, it just don't feel
  like a win.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  Hm.
\item
  scott watson\\
  So where do we go from here? Where do I go from here?

  I'm trying to get my mojo back. But I keep seeing the same stuff.

  I haven't seen change. I haven't seen real change yet.

  But I'm going to retire. And I'm going to go off into the sunset. I
  hate to retire in a sense, because who replaces me? Will it be someone
  not from our community?

  So the real answer is, I don't know.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  I guess I'm still wondering, and I don't mean to belabor this point.
  But you hear so much about recruiting more Black officers as one of
  the solutions for reform. And I feel like this kind of call for
  diversity happens each time. I mean, when Michael Brown was shot, a
  big criticism was that the Ferguson police department didn't go home
  at night to Ferguson. They went to their suburbs, far away from
  Ferguson. They didn't actually live in the community they policed. And
  after the Dallas shootings, the five officers in Dallas were shot, I
  remember that Dallas police chief said, like, if you want to change,
  we're hiring. Get off the protest line. And come in ---
\item
  scott watson\\
  Come on in.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  --- to the police department. Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  scott watson\\
  That's true.
\item
  lynsea garrison\\
  And is that true, though? Is that the thing that will change? Or would
  you get a flood of Black police officers who are, I don't know,
  divided from the white officers. Then you'd have these two departments
  instead of this one department. And that would limit the change that
  those Black officers could bring.
\item
  scott watson\\
  I mean, that's a very tough question.

  I don't know. I don't have a definitive answer for that. But I will
  say this.

  I just went to the park not too long ago. And I had a basketball, a
  brand new basketball that was sitting around my house that I had
  bought for my son. And I went to this one park. And I'm like, you know
  what? I'm going to just go out there and just get me some shots up.
  And just kick it with the people that I know, you know? And when I'm
  done, I'm going to let them keep this basketball. So when they have
  good games going on or whatever, you know, they'll have a really good
  basketball to use. You know it will be the park basketball. But it's
  little things like that. But that's just me. You know? That's just me.
\end{itemize}

In a statement to The Times, the City of Flint acknowledged that the
police department had received complaints about Facebook posts made by
police officers, and said that each of the complaints was investigated
and quote, ``appropriately handled.'' They also noted that the
department has recently launched a special recruitment effort to hire
more officers who are from Flint. The city has also hired a new chief of
police, Terence Green, who was himself born and raised in Flint. Green
has said that addressing the morale of officers is among his first
priorities coming into office. He begins his post tomorrow.

The man who was shot and killed was wearing a hat with the insignia of
Patriot Prayer, a far right group based in the Portland area that has
clashed with protesters in the past. President Trump, who has repeatedly
highlighted the unrest in Portland in his re-election campaign, said it
was the latest evidence that Democratic-run cities are out of control.
In a tweet defending his supporters, the president wrote, quote, ``The
big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected.'' In response,
his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, accused the president of quote,
``recklessly encouraging violence.''

\emph{This episode contains strong language.}

As a police officer in his hometown of Flint, Mich., Scott Watson has
worked to become a pillar of the community, believing his identity has
placed him in a unique position to do his job. He has given out his
cellphone number, driven students to prom and provided food and money to
those who were hungry.

After watching the video of the killing of George Floyd, his identity as
a Black police officer became a source of self-consciousness instead of
pride.

Today, we speak to Mr. Watson about his career and the internal
conflicts that have arisen from his role.
