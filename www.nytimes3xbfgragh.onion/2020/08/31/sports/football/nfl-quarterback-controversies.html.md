This season’s must-watch competitions are traditional (Aaron Rodgers),

The problem with a quarterback competition between Mitch Trubisky and
Nick Foles is that the winner will be either Mitch Trubisky or Nick
Foles.

Trubisky is a flailing prospect with spotty accuracy and jittery pocket
presence whom the Chicago Bears famously selected instead of Patrick
Mahomes and DeShaun Watson in the 2017 N.F.L. draft. Foles is an
affable-but-turnover-prone journeyman who parlayed his heroics for the
Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII into a lucrative reputation as a
“proven winner.” Both are only semi-effective in four-game bursts, so
if the Chicago Bears juggle them just right, they might be poised to go
8-8 again.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Trubisky-Foles competition is typical by N.F.L. standards: an
organizational effort to solve one problem by throwing a slightly
different problem at it. Other quarterback controversies this season
also follow traditional story lines: fading superstar vs. heir apparent,
injury-plagued veteran vs. healthy upstart, and so forth. But 2020 also
features its share of nontraditional competitions pitting quarterbacks
against their employers, their reputations, or the ravages of time.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Here’s a brief recap of the league’s most compelling quarterback-centric
dramas, comedies, and potential tragedies that will get you ready for
the season.

## Packers: Aaron Rodgers vs. Jordan Love

It would take a team of marriage counselors working around the clock in
hazmat suits to safely isolate and document all of the toxicity that
exists between [Aaron Rodgers and the Packers
organization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/21/sports/football/aaron-rodgers-packers-coach.html).
Rodgers, a two-time most valuable player in incremental decline from his
early-2010s peak, has been signaling his dissatisfaction with his
receivers and his disapproval with the team’s game plans for years. By
[trading up to
draft](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/sports/football/nfl-draft-live.html)
Utah State’s [talented-but-erratic Jordan
Love](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/jordan-love.html) with
the 26th pick, instead of a receiver or potential starter at another
position, the Packers gave a clear indication that the feelings were
mutual.

Love represents a long-term exit strategy, not an immediate threat to
Rodgers’ starting job. Still, his presence ensures that every Packers
game will feel like dinner with a couple that’s only staying together
for the sake of the kids.

Despite the festering dysfunction, the Packers went 13-3 last season,
meaning that this year they could become the first team to win the Super
Bowl out of sheer passive-aggression.

## Cowboys: Dak Prescott vs. Jerry Jones

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dak Prescott finished second in the N.F.L. in passing yards (4,902) and
fourth in passing touchdowns (30) last season, but Jerry Jones’s ongoing
effort to balance the Cowboys’ budget on Prescott’s back creates the
impression that the organization is somehow dissatisfied with its
quarterback.

Jones reportedly wants to sign Prescott to a five-year contract, because
Jones is the sort of financial planner who uses a credit card to make
payments on his luxury sedan’s lease so he doesn’t fall behind on his
40-year mortgage. Prescott wants a four-year contract because
quarterback salaries increase significantly each year and he wants to
re-enter the market as soon as possible. Carson Wentz, [Patrick
Mahomes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/sports/football/pat-mahomes-contract.html)
and others have signed market-resetting deals during the impasse,
meaning Jones has spent two years losing bitter contract negotiations
against himself.

Prescott will earn $31.4 million this year [as the team’s franchise
player](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/sports/football/franchise-tag-dak-prescott.html).
If the Cowboys really are still making up their minds about him, then
the presence of the 32-year old backup and Cincinnati Bengals castoff
Andy Dalton provides some leverage. For Prescott, not for the
Cowboys.

## Buccaneers: Tom Brady vs. Mortality

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Brady’s yards-per-game average, touchdown rate, completion rate and
efficiency rating all have been in decline since 2016. The [Buccaneers
signed
Brady](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/sports/football/tom-brady-signed-tampa-bay.html),
who turned 43 in early August, for $50 million guaranteed over two
seasons and will surround him with [impressive
talent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/sports/football/tom-brady-tampa-bay-buccaneers.html)both
young (Chris Godwin and Mike Evans, who each had more than 1,000
receiving yards last season) and old ([Rob
Gronkowski](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/sports/football/rob-gronkowski-tom-brady-buccaneers-patriots.html)
returns as Brady’s kooky sitcom nephew). They’ll try to help Brady defy
the unstoppable passage of time.

All that now stands between Brady and a seventh Super Bowl ring are his
obviously diminishing skills. Oh, and a radically different offensive
system. And an unfamiliar supporting cast. And a much tougher division,
And a much weaker organization than the one he left. Otherwise: smooth
sailing.

## Patriots: Cam Newton vs. Perceptions

Newton, the 2015 M.V.P. and three-time Pro Bowl selection, is
technically battling the career backup Brian Hoyer and the
quasi-prospect Jarrett Stidham for the Patriots’ starting job. More
accurately, [Newton is
battling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/sports/football/cam-newton-new-england-patriots.html)
four years of foot and shoulder injuries which have eroded his
athleticism, as well as Tom Brady’s legacy, high expectations, and the
perception among a vocal segment of N.F.L. fandom that the [Patriots
replaced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/28/sports/football/cam-newton-patriots-fine.html)
a nigh-immortal warrior demigod with a flighty guy in a romper and head
scarf.

The Patriots’ 2020 roster is depleted because of free-agent departures
and Covid-19 opt-outs, and their receiving corps is built for Brady’s
precision micropassing, not Newton’s bombs-away style. If the Patriots
somehow remain Super Bowl contenders, [all credit will go to Bill
Belichick](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/sports/football/cam-newton-patriots-deal.html)
and “The Patriots Way.” If they tumble, the polarizing Newton will be
blamed for the downfall of western
civilization.

The N.F.L.’s generic team was planning to stage a generic competition
between Dwayne Haskins (their 2019 first-round pick, abandoned by the
[outgoing
regime](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/07/sports/jay-gruden-redskins.html))
and [Kyle
Allen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/11/06/sports/football/06nfl-allens-quiz.html)
(a security-blanket backup brought aboard by the [incoming
regime](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/31/sports/football/ron-rivera-washington-redskins.html)).
Their plans shifted when [Alex
Smith](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/18/sports/alex-smith-injury-redskins-texans.html)
was cleared to return to the field, 22 months after a [devastating 2018
leg
injury](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/18/sports/alex-smith-injury-joe-theismann.html)
followed by severe complications and months of surgeries and setbacks.

Smith’s return is nearly miraculous, so only a coldhearted scoundrel
would point out that the rebuilding Football Team would be better off
with one of the youngsters than a battered 36-year-old like Smith.
Whether as a starter or a mentor, Smith will provide leadership,
inspiration and a feel-good story for a franchise that would otherwise
be little more than the sports equivalent of the [empty pedestal where
an offensive statue used to

on the edges of their theoretical seats.

## Raiders: Derek Carr vs. Marcus Mariota

Having lost his starting job to the faded prospect Ryan Tannehill, the
faded prospect Marcus Mariota signed with the Raiders to challenge the
incumbent faded prospect Derek Carr. The stage is now set for Carr to
lose the Raiders job, then sign with the Jets next year once Sam Darnold
inevitably fades, freeing Darnold to eventually sign with the Titans
once they sour on Tannehill.

It’s a quarterback controversy merry-go-round of futility, and staying
off it is the reason that neither signing an over-the-hill legend nor
ruffling a superstar’s feathers by drafting a challenger is as foolish
as such tactics might sound.
