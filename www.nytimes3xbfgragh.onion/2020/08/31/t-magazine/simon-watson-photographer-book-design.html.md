# A New Book from a Renowned Photographer of Interiors

Throughout his career, Simon Watson has brought his unique eye to
crumbling castles, monastic apartments and everything in between.

In the 1530s, Cardinal Marcello Cervini, the future Pope Marcellus II,
bought Castello Cervini, a medieval monastery surrounded by chestnut
trees in Tuscany’s Vivo d’Orcia estate. And while Marcellus II passed
away just 22 days after ascending to the papacy in 1555, his family has
retained the property for four centuries and counting. By the time the
photographer [Simon
Watson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/13/t-magazine/decade-in-photos-simon-watson.html)
visited, in 2002, Marcellus’s descendants Daria Cervini and her siblings
had turned the castle into a summer retreat, but many tokens of the
family’s past remained, and a portrait of the ill-fated pope in a
crimson mozzetta kept watch over all.

Watson set about capturing what he calls the residence’s “poetic
beauty,” and the results — an image of a wallpapered bedroom with a
pair of twin beds awash in a blueish light, another of the arm of a pink
sofa set next to a small vase of matching freshly picked flowers **** —
are, along with his photos of 19 other homes, included in his
forthcoming book, “[The Lives of
Others](https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847869008/).” Paging
through, one is immediately aware of why the photographer is sought out
by many magazines, including T. “Aesthetic beauty is what stirs me and
what always will,” says Watson, adding, “I suppose [because I grew up in
Dublin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/27/t-magazine/simon-watson-home-dublin.html),
I had a natural affinity for the Georgian sensibility. I spent time
living in old houses with crumbling plasterwork and broken floorboards.”

Indeed, his pictures are often of homes that wear their history on their
sleeves. But the images’ ease and elegance stem from much more than the
physical elements within the frame, however fine. Watson is a master of
light and color, and his work has earned comparisons to that of the
Dutch masters. He favors natural light — as [Tom
Delavan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/tom-delavan), who is T’s
design/interiors director, writes in the book’s foreword, “shutters are
his tool of choice, canted at seemingly random angles to transform
spaces into something dramatically beautiful” — and painterly hues, from
saturated aquas to misty greens to deep reds.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Watson also has a keen sense of people, or rather how people might exist
in a space, retreating to one favorite corner to work and another to
relax. His Castello Cervini pictures don’t emphasize the property’s
grandness so much as they convey a sense of intimacy and authenticity —
there’s some peeling floral wallpaper that reveals the older painted
trim beneath; there’s a skylit table piled with books; there’s a small,
beloved teddy bear. It’s almost as though, as with Horst P. Horst’s
20th-century pictures of grand homes, Watson is merely peeking from one
room into another, never wishing to intrude or disrupt the natural state
of things. If you look closely, even in a picture of the home’s imposing
facade, taken with the camera tilted upward, a figure peers down from an
upstairs window, a seeming reminder, as the book title implies, of the
lives lived
inside.

Watson’s own life has been just as rich. His parents immersed him and
his siblings in fine art and classical architecture from a young age.
The photographer, now 51, went on to study film at a small college in
his native Dublin, but soon dropped out and spent time working in cities
around Europe. “Slowly, different events in my life gradually brought me
to photography. My father bought me a camera when I was 15 or 16, and
I’d wander around taking black-and-white pictures of anything and
everything,” he says. “I also just liked the idea of being a
photographer, probably for all the wrong reasons — working as an
assistant and doing the odd magazine shoot here and there, maybe too
many viewings of Antonioni’s
‘[Blow-Up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/19/movies/blow-up-michaelangelo-antonioni-film-forum.html)’
\[the 1966 film in which David Hemmings plays a fashion photographer\].
When one is young, one is impressionable.” In 1989, Watson moved to New
York and launched what is now a three-decade career that has spanned
commercial and editorial work as well as personal projects, such as his
2006 exhibition at Poland’s Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, “[A
Lingering
Presence](http://www.simonwatson.com/projects/a-lingering-presence/),”
which documented spaces at the concentration camp that had never been
open to the
public.

With “The Lives of Others,” out from Rizzoli next week, Watson presents
an edit of the interiors he has been commissioned to photograph over the
years, and includes many previously unpublished images. Each section
opens with a vignette in which he riffs on the featured characters and
spaces. Castel Gardena, a 17th-century hunting lodge in the Dolomites
owned by the winemaker Andrea Franchetti, was, Watson writes, in a
“glorious state of romantic disrepair,” with various animals chewing
noisily in the walls and scurrying through his room at
night.

But mostly the photos speak for themselves. Those of Casa Horta, the
architect and furniture designer [Guillermo
Santomà](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/08/27/t-magazine/architect-guillermo-santoma-casa-horta-barcelona.html)’s
surrealist Barcelona home, show a bubblegum pink dining room with
plastic lawn chairs that Santomà **** partially melted with a blowtorch,
as well as a still-life of fruit and architectural elements painted
directly on the wall by the artist [Marria
Pratts](https://www.instagram.com/marriapratts/). “When I stepped in, I
immediately thought, this guy is great; this guy has got such a vivid
imagination,” Watson says. Another architect with a distinctive vision,
[Arno
Brandlhuber](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/10/t-magazine/arno-brandlhuber-brutalist-architecture-home.html),
fashioned Antivilla, his lake house near Potsdam, out of an old East
German underwear factory, using sledgehammers to smash asymmetrical
windows into the concrete walls. “It’s abrupt and Brutalist, not
dissimilar to Brandlhuber himself,” says Watson. Clearly, it’s the
personal details that linger with him: “The place where someone lives is
a portrait of who they are,” Watson says. “You can tell their humor and
their character.”
