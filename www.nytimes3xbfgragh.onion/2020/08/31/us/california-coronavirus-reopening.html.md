*Good morning.*

On Friday, more than a month after the state [ordered most indoor
businesses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html)
to close again, Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled California’s second attempt
at a comprehensive plan to reopen.

“We’ve learned a lot over the last number of months,” Mr. Newsom said.

Gone is the county “monitoring list” system, which was rolled out
piecemeal and has been criticized as confusing and fragmented.

In its place going forward, the governor said, is a framework that sorts
each of the state’s 58 counties into a tier, which will determine how
much businesses are restricted.

Unlike the monitoring-list model, which was based on a matrix of numbers
that was difficult to parse, the new system is based largely on new
daily case numbers per 100,000 residents, as well as positivity rates.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

*\[Track coronavirus cases* [*in each California
county*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/california-coronavirus-cases.html#cases)*.\]*

Gone is leeway for county public health officials to make their own case
to reopen; counties now won’t be able to move to a less restrictive tier
unless they have met that tier’s criteria for at least two consecutive
weeks. And each county must stay in its current tier for at least three
weeks before it can move.

If a county’s numbers worsen for two weeks in a row, it will be moved to
a more restrictive tier.

“We’re going to be more stubborn this time,” Mr. Newsom said.

The state’s earlier moves to reopen businesses were criticized for being
too hasty and driven by the impatience of some businesses and some
smaller, largely rural counties, rather than by evidence. (This month,
for instance, The Los Angeles Times [published this
timeline](https://www.latimes.com/projects/how-rushed-la-reopening-sparked-covid-19-cases/)
showing how a rush to reopen businesses in Los Angeles County
contributed to the virus’s alarming spread.)

Still, experts have said that the intense focus on whether to reopen
nonessential businesses like restaurants, bars and movie theaters has
come at the expense of [what should have been more stringent
enforcement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/newsom-coronavirus-valley.html)
of restrictions at large essential workplaces, where lower-wage workers
were never able to stop working.

That is true particularly in the Central Valley, which has become the
state’s most troubling and persistent hot spot.

Mr. Newsom said on Friday that enforcement “strike teams,” including
officials from various state agencies, have been doing spot checks
aggressively for months, but that an expansion of enforcement capacity
is “being negotiated” in the state’s Legislature.

**Here are answers to questions you might have:**

**How did we get here?**

All the way [back in
April](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-california-reopening-phases.html),
Mr. Newsom laid out what he described as a science-driven, deliberate
phased process for reopening based on metrics such as hospitalizations,
case growth and deaths.

But over the months that followed, the complexity of reopening a state
with 58 very different counties spread across vast and varied geography
became apparent.

Ceding to pressure from some businesses and officials mostly in smaller,
more rural counties, Mr. Newsom announced a process for certain
[counties to move more quickly to reopen
businesses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/19/us/california-reopening.html)
than the rest of the state, effectively loosening the restrictions and
adding complexity.

Then the state shifted to the “monitoring list,” which eventually came
to encompass 90 percent of the state’s population.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

In July, [as cases
surged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/california-coronavirus-new-york-cases.html),
[state officials
announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/us/california-counties-reopening.html)
that bars, which had been allowed to reopen indoors in many places,
would have to shutter. Indoor operations of restaurants, card rooms and
movie theaters were also ordered to close.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The result was a kind of [emotional and economic
whiplash](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/us/california-covid-19-cases.html).

**So what do the tiers mean?**

[There are four color-coded
tiers](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/) ranging from most
restrictive to least: purple, red, orange and yellow. (There is no
green, the governor noted — no county should see this as an opportunity
to go back to normal.)

Counties have already been placed in a tier based on their recent new
case numbers and positivity rates. They’ll be able to reopen businesses
that are allowed in their given tier as early as today.

But not a whole lot will change immediately for the vast majority of
Californians. The most restrictive tier, the purple, applies to 38
counties, including Los Angeles and Orange, that are home to more than
80 percent of the state’s population.

In these counties, many kinds of businesses must remain closed, unless
they can operate outdoors, including restaurants. All bars, breweries
and distilleries must stay closed, too, even if they have outdoor space.
Hair salons, barber shops and malls can reopen indoors with
modifications, however.

Nine counties are in the second most restrictive tier, the red,
including San Diego and San Francisco, where some indoor dining will be
allowed starting today. Gyms, houses of worship and movie theaters will
also be allowed to reopen indoors with limited capacity.

About a dozen mostly smaller and more rural counties are in the two
least [restrictive
tiers](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Dimmer-Framework-August_2020.pdf),
which allow them to reopen bars and other indoor businesses at higher
maximum
capacities.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

**Will this affect school reopening?**

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

According to state officials, the [same school reopening
rules](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/us/california-schools-reopening-newsom.html)
that the governor laid out in July will still apply, except now, the
counties in the most restrictive tier will be swapped in where [the
rules
refer](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Schools%20Reopening%20Recommendations.pdf)
to the county monitoring list.

It’s still hardly straightforward. [Teachers’ unions have expressed
concerns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/us/teacher-union-school-reopening-coronavirus.html)
about being forced to return to the classroom before it’s safe. The
state has a [waiver process for some elementary
schools](https://edsource.org/2020/california-health-officials-list-conditions-for-an-elementary-school-waiver/637621)
to reopen even in counties where in-person instruction isn’t allowed.
And as thousands of [college students have returned to
campuses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html),
challenges continue to emerge.

Chadwick Boseman was a private figure by Hollywood standards, [my
colleagues wrote over the
weekend](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/movies/chadwick-boseman-dead.html).
That’s maybe why it came as such a particularly wrenching shock that the
actor, 43, died on Friday at home in Los Angeles.

But as [countless
fans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/movies/chadwick-boseman-reaction.html)
have observed, he learned he had [colon
cancer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/29/health/colon-cancer-chadwick-boseman.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)in
2016, well before he took on some of his highest profile roles,
including T’Challa in “Black Panther.” Which means that he may have had
some time to think about the legacy he would leave behind.

My colleague Wesley Morris wrote that that’s a body of work portraying
[exceptional Black Americans with
dignity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/29/movies/chadwick-boseman-appraisal.html)
— and making that dignity interesting.

“Boseman was no impersonator,” Wesley wrote. “He was in his way a
historian.”
