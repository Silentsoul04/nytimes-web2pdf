The decision by the nation’s top intelligence official [to halt
classified, in-person briefings to
Congress](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/29/us/politics/election-security-intelligence-briefings-congress.html)
about foreign interference in a [presidential
election](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/us/trump-vs-biden)
that is just nine weeks away exposes the fundamental tension about who
needs to know this information: just the president, or the voters whose
election infrastructure, and minds, are the target of the hacking?

The intelligence agencies are built to funnel a stream of secret
findings to the president, his staff and the military to inform their
actions.

President Trump has made it abundantly clear that he does not believe
the overwhelming evidence, detailed in thousands of pages of
investigative reports [by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence
Committee](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/senate-intelligence-russian-interference-report.html)
and indictments of Russian intelligence officers by his own Justice
Department, that Moscow interfered in the 2016 election, and is at it
again.

One of the bitter lessons of the last election is that those defending
against disinformation campaigns include not just the president and his
staff but also state and city election officials; Facebook, Twitter and
Google; and voters themselves, who need to know who is generating or
amplifying the messages they see running across their screens.

And if they do not understand the threat assessments, they will enter
the most critical phase of the election — those vulnerable weeks when
everything counts and adversaries have a brief window to take their best
shot — without understanding the battle space.

So it is no surprise that as soon as word leaked about the decision by
the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, to give Congress
only written updates about the latest intelligence, former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr. led the parade of accusations that Mr.
Trump was paving the way for a second round of election interference.

“Nothing is more important than the security and integrity of our
elections,” Mr. Biden,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>said in
a statement on Saturday. “And we know that President Trump is unwilling
to take action to protect them. That leaves Congress as the best
defender of our democracy.

“There can be only one conclusion: President Trump is hoping Vladimir
Putin will once more boost his candidacy and cover his horrific failures
to lead our country through the multiple crises we are facing,” Mr.
Biden added. “And he does not want the American people to know the steps
Vladimir Putin is taking to help Trump get re-elected or why Putin is
eager to intervene, because Donald Trump’s foreign policy has been a
gift to the Kremlin.”
