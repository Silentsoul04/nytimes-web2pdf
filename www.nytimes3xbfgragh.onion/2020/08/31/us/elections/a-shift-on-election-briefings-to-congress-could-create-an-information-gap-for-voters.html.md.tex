The decision by the nation's top intelligence official
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/29/us/politics/election-security-intelligence-briefings-congress.html}{to
halt classified, in-person briefings to Congress} about foreign
interference in a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/us/trump-vs-biden}{presidential
election} that is just nine weeks away exposes the fundamental tension
about who needs to know this information: just the president, or the
voters whose election infrastructure, and minds, are the target of the
hacking?

The intelligence agencies are built to funnel a stream of secret
findings to the president, his staff and the military to inform their
actions.

President Trump has made it abundantly clear that he does not believe
the overwhelming evidence, detailed in thousands of pages of
investigative reports
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/senate-intelligence-russian-interference-report.html}{by
the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee} and indictments of
Russian intelligence officers by his own Justice Department, that Moscow
interfered in the 2016 election, and is at it again.

One of the bitter lessons of the last election is that those defending
against disinformation campaigns include not just the president and his
staff but also state and city election officials; Facebook, Twitter and
Google; and voters themselves, who need to know who is generating or
amplifying the messages they see running across their screens.

And if they do not understand the threat assessments, they will enter
the most critical phase of the election --- those vulnerable weeks when
everything counts and adversaries have a brief window to take their best
shot --- without understanding the battle space.

So it is no surprise that as soon as word leaked about the decision by
the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, to give Congress
only written updates about the latest intelligence, former Vice
President Joseph R. Biden Jr. led the parade of accusations that Mr.
Trump was paving the way for a second round of election interference.

``Nothing is more important than the security and integrity of our
elections,'' Mr. Biden, said in a statement on Saturday. ``And we know
that President Trump is unwilling to take action to protect them. That
leaves Congress as the best defender of our democracy.

``There can be only one conclusion: President Trump is hoping Vladimir
Putin will once more boost his candidacy and cover his horrific failures
to lead our country through the multiple crises we are facing,'' Mr.
Biden added. ``And he does not want the American people to know the
steps Vladimir Putin is taking to help Trump get re-elected or why Putin
is eager to intervene, because Donald Trump's foreign policy has been a
gift to the Kremlin.''
