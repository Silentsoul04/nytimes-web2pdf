Communications}\label{house-panel-to-subpoena-dejoy-over-mail-delays-and-trump-communications}}

The chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee said the postmaster
general had withheld requested documents, telling her panel his verbal
testimony should suffice.

WASHINGTON --- Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York
and the chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, said Monday that
she would subpoena
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/louis-dejoy-usps-paid.html}{Louis
DeJoy}, the postmaster general, for documents she said he had withheld
from Congress related to mail delays and communications with the Trump
campaign.

The subpoena is the latest sign of escalating tension between the new
postmaster general ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/general-louis-dejoy-postmaster.html}{an
ally of President Trump and Republican megadonor} --- and leading
Democrats, who have accused him of injecting dysfunction into the United
States Postal Service before the November election. The changes Mr.
DeJoy has instituted have resulted in confusion and coincided with a
slowdown in delivery times and a concerted effort by the president to
baselessly attack mail-in voting as fraudulent, arguing that it hurts
his re-election chances.

In a statement, the Postal Service said it was ``surprised and
confused'' by the committee's subpoena.

``We will continue to cooperate with the oversight committees in both
the House and Senate, and we fully intend to comply with our obligations
under the law,'' the statement said.

The statement also said mail performance was beginning to improve after
suffering declines during Mr. DeJoy's first months on the job, when he
implemented cost-cutting measures, including a more regimented schedule
for running mail trucks at specified times. Documents released Monday
afternoon by the Postal Service show an improvement in delivery times,
but not a full return to the level of service provided before Mr. DeJoy
implemented his changes.

``We are improving service performance while more consistently running
our trucks on time,'' Mr. DeJoy said in the statement.

For months, members of Congress have sought documents from Mr. DeJoy
about delays in election mail, the removal of machinery and how he has
chosen to run the agency. Internal documents show some aspects of mail
performance had fallen by as much as 8 percent since he took the helm of
the agency.

Democrats have raised concerns that Mr. DeJoy is interfering with the
mail as part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to sow distrust in voting
by mail ahead of a pandemic-era election in which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/11/us/politics/vote-by-mail-us-states.html}{mail-in
ballots will play an outsize role}. Among their requests for documents:
information about the removal of hundreds of letter-sorting machines and
the limiting of overtime --- both actions denounced by union officials.

Mr. DeJoy has yet to provide any documents to Congress since a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/politics/louis-dejoy-post-office-hearing.html}{hearing
last week} of Ms. Maloney's committee, during which Democrats grilled
the postmaster general and some called for him to resign.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/31/us/politics/31dc-postal-2/merlin_170349543_05de1341-09f1-4d26-b65d-8e6af59f8997-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

Ms. Maloney said she received a letter from Mr. DeJoy on Friday night
that said: ``I trust my Aug. 24 testimony before the Committee on
Oversight and Reform clarified any outstanding questions you had.'' In
the letter, Mr. DeJoy added that his staff was working on providing
materials to the committee, though Ms. Maloney said he had missed last
week's deadline to provide the documents voluntarily.

The subpoena ``makes clear as a legal matter that the production of
these documents is mandatory,'' Ms. Maloney said Monday. She sent a
memorandum notifying members of the panel of her plans, meaning the
subpoena will most likely be delivered to Mr. DeJoy by Wednesday.

However, the leading Republican on the committee, Representative James
Comer of Kentucky, called Ms. Maloney's move ``unilateral'' and argued
that it broke an agreement between Democrats and Republicans to hold a
business meeting before issuing any subpoenas.

``Today's antics are part of a backwards pattern by the Democrats to
promote a baseless conspiracy theory about the Postal Service,'' Mr.
Comer said. ``Instead of allowing the Postal Service to do what it does
best --- deliver mail to hundreds of millions of Americans --- it will
now spend hundreds of hours responding to this partisan subpoena,'' Mr.
Comer said.

top House Democrat calls for the suspension of Postmaster General Louis
DeJoy over campaign finance allegations.}

In addition to the subpoena, Ms. Maloney said she was requesting
documents from Robert Duncan, the chairman of the Postal Service board
of governors, who also runs a Republican ``super PAC.'' Among the
documents sought from Mr. Duncan include any communications between
board members and the White House and between the board members and Mr.
DeJoy.

Ms. Maloney signaled her intention last week to compel the production of
documents.

``This committee expects a full and complete production of all the
documents we requested no later than this coming Wednesday,'' she warned
Mr. DeJoy at the hearing last Monday. ``And if you continue to withhold
information or otherwise fail to comply, you can expect a subpoena.''

Several Democrats urged Ms. Maloney to take such a step.

During one exchange with Mr. DeJoy, Representative Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, sought copies of Mr. DeJoy's
calendar since he started the job on June 15.

``I don't want to set a precedent for my calendar to be submitted every
two months,'' Mr. DeJoy objected.

``I would say the details of this calendar are extraordinarily important
to the committee's investigations,'' Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told Ms. Maloney.
``And if we cannot receive them voluntarily, I would recommend
consideration of a subpoena for these details.''

His calendar is now part of the subpoena request.
