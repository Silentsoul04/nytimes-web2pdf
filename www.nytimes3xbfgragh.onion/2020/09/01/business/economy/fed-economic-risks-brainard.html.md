WASHINGTON — Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor, said on Tuesday
that the U.S. economy remained at risk as the coronavirus pandemic wore
on — and support from Congress and the White House would be crucial to
cushioning the blow.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty that continues to cloud the outlook;
downside risks continue to be important,” Ms. Brainard said at a
Brookings Institution event. “It is very important to many households
and businesses to have continued fiscal support — just as it was
important to them in the early phase of this crisis.”

Her comments came as the future of another government support package
remained unclear. Ms. Brainard, who was appointed during the Obama
administration, said that monetary policy would also play a key role as
pandemic uncertainty persisted, and that central bankers would need to
pivot from stabilizing markets to supporting economic growth in the
coming months.

“It will be important to provide the requisite accommodation to achieve
maximum employment and average inflation of 2 percent over time,” she
said.

The Fed unveiled a [new long-run policy
statement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/business/economy/federal-reserve-inflation-jerome-powell.html)
last week, making critical updates to its strategy for achieving its
goals of full employment and stable inflation. Ms. Brainard said the
tweaks, which together laid the groundwork for long periods of very low
interest rates, would help to guide the central bank’s policies coming
out of the pandemic.

One key change — the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will now
aim for 2 percent inflation on average over time, instead of as a more
or less absolute goal — will allow for low rates even as prices climb
slightly, she said.

“I would expect the committee to accommodate rather than offset
inflationary pressures moderately above 2 percent, in a process of
opportunistic reflation,” she
said.

The Fed’s rework included a major change to the way it views low
unemployment. Officials tweaked their long-run strategy statement to say
that they would worry about “shortfalls” from full employment, rather
than “deviations.” In plain terms, that means that the Fed will no
longer raise interest rates simply because joblessness has fallen to low
levels.

That’s a big shift from the recent past: The Fed lifted interest rates
nine times between 2015 and the end of 2018 partly out of concern that
the job market would overheat and spur inflation. Instead, price
increases stagnated.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Brainard said that if the Fed had been using the new strategy
several years ago, “it is likely that accommodation would have been
withdrawn later, and the gains would have been greater.”

Richard H. Clarida, the Fed’s vice chair and the head of the
year-and-a-half review of the Fed’s policy framework that resulted in
the updates, also highlighted the central bank’s new approach to full
employment [during a
speech](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#a-top-fed-official-says-low-unemployment-alone-wont-trigger-higher-rates)
this week.

Low joblessness “will not, under our new framework, be a sufficient
trigger for policy action,” Mr. Clarida said, absent pressing financial
stability concerns or evidence that inflation is overheating or is
likely to run hot.

The Fed’s revised statement emphasized that financial stability concerns
will be an important consideration in a world where interest rates are
likely to stay low for extended periods, driving investors to make
bigger bets in hopes of richer payouts. But Ms. Brainard said monetary
policy should not be the primary tool for fighting such bubbles.

Instead, she said, the Fed should use regulation and other forms of
oversight to tamp down risks. As part of that tool kit, she said, banks
should be retaining their capital — money they can readily tap — to make
sure they remain healthy amid the pandemic stress.

“I don’t think they should be paying out dividends,” Ms. Brainard said
of commercial banks. “I think they should be hanging onto their
buffers.”

The Fed oversees large bank holding companies, and has not yet stopped
them from paying dividends to their shareholders. [Ms. Brainard
objected](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/brainard-statement-20200625c.htm)
to that decision.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Fed has been grappling with slow-burn changes to the United States
and global economy. The level of interest rates that the economy can
handle without slowing down has fallen, inflation has slipped lower and
the relationship between tight labor markets and price gains seems to
have broken down. Together, the changes have sapped monetary policy of
its strength by leaving officials less room to cut borrowing costs to
stimulate growth during downturns.

The Fed announced that it would revisit its policy approach in late 2018
in light of those shifts, and months of conferences and public forums
led to the strategy update.

In a panel after Ms. Brainard’s remarks on Tuesday, former Fed officials
suggested that the framework Chair Jerome H. Powell detailed last week
was a step in the right direction but not a panacea.

“They need to work harder to think about how the different tools
coordinate with each other — how they’re going to think about financial
stability, how they’re going to add firepower,” said Ben S. Bernanke,
who was Fed chair during the 2008 financial crisis. “There’s a lot to be
done still. This is just an aspirational, constitutional kind of
statement.”

And Janet L. Yellen, who was Mr. Bernanke’s successor, said the central
bank could not go it alone as it tried to help the United States to
recover from the pandemic-spurred economic crisis.

“In a situation like we’re in now, fiscal policy is necessary and plays
an important role,” Ms. Yellen said. “There’s a little bit more the Fed
can do — I would look at exploring the tool kit — but I think we also
need fiscal policy in a situation like this.”
