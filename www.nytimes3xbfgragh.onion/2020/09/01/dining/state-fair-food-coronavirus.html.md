Last October, to kick off her 20th year as a vendor at the [North
Carolina State Fair](http://www.ncstatefair.org/index.htm), Felicia
Turrentine-Daniel unveiled the Chickenator: a cinnamon roll sliced like
a hamburger bun to hold a deep-fried chicken breast, bacon, pepper Jack
cheese and a drizzle of honeyed Sriracha.

“We make sure that we bring in something new and big every year,” said
Ms. Turrentine-Daniel, who runs the booth Chef’s D’Lites. She met her
husband, Jason Daniel, while they both worked in a grocery store, “and
we would literally walk up and down the aisles and find different things
to put in the fryer, to see what came out.”

On July 29, when North Carolina’s became the 35th state fair to be
canceled or severely curtailed, her friends, family and regular
customers called and emailed: Was she OK? And oh, by the way, was there
any chance they could still order a deep-fried Cuban roll, or those
fried banana pudding

On the [Facebook page](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/chefsdlites/)
for Chef’s D’Lites, Ms. Turrentine-Daniel, 42, now accepts
direct-message orders for dishes she can fry, freeze and ship, including
the Cuban rolls and her deep-fried macaroni and cheese, with
instructions on how to finish the dish in the oven, microwave or deep
fryer. Chickenators don’t ship well, but she has delivered them fresh to
customers who live within a 30-minute drive of her home in Greensboro.

“Just meet me halfway, and we’ll work it out,” she said.

Across the country, concessionaires are going to great lengths, from
organizing drive-throughs to buying delivery trucks, to keep the
fair-food pipeline intact as state fairs continue to be called off — so
far, in 36 states and the District of Columbia — many for the first time
since World War II. And fair regulars, the people who can tell you
definitively which of eight near-identical cheese curd trailers is the
best, or who keep annually updated checklists of foods on a stick, are
coming out to support their favorite vendors.

Lori Lexvold has attended the Minnesota State Fair, in a Twin Cities
suburb, every summer for 53 of her 58 years. When it was called off in
late May, “I thought, what in the world is going to happen to all these
vendors?” she said. “This is their livelihood.”

She heard that some were setting up where they could find space: church
lawns, mall parking lots, outside a Harley-Davidson dealership.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I got on Facebook one morning and I created a group,” said Ms. Lexvold,
who lives in Forest Lake, about a half-hour drive from the fairgrounds.
“I invited about 100 of my friends. I just said, ‘Hey, if you see any
food stands around, post it to this page, so we can all go.’”

The group, [Fair Food
Finder](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/groups/245420266734458), now
has nearly 179,000 members, a Google map of 139 Minnesota vendors and a
phone app created by an enthusiastic fan.

“It was crazy,” Ms. Lexvold said of a time this summer when she was
getting 10,000 requests a day from strangers wanting to join, and phone
calls from vendors asking how to post on the page. “I thought, how in
the dickens are you finding my phone number?”

Ms. Lexvold found her fair-food fix at the Anoka County Fairgrounds
outside Minneapolis, where three vendors had parked. They were in the
big, traditional state-fair trailers, Ms. Lexvold said, with Hollywood
bulbs and colorful flags, selling not just fries, but also ice cream,
cheese curds and mini-doughnuts, fresh from the fryer.

“People pulled chairs out of the back of their cars, and sat there and
had a little picnic,” she said. “I thought, this is what it’s all
about.”

([State Fair To Go](https://www.statefairtogo.com/), a new business
based in Minnetonka, Minn., ships boxes of Minnesota State Fair food
within the continental United States. Each box costs $59.95 — with free
shipping within the state — and contains six fair staples, including
Elliott’s Up North corn dogs, Rosie’s French fries and Sweet Martha’s
cookies. This week, the company began selling a $64.95 box of foods from
the State Fair of
Texas.)

Stephanie Shimp couldn’t exactly tow around [the Blue

it’s a full-size barn that stands on the grounds year-round. In June,
she took out a loan to buy and revamp a decommissioned grocery delivery
truck. She held her first event, in a brewery parking lot, just one day
after taking possession of the truck, and sold out of food in four
hours. “It was kind of chaos,” said Ms. Shimp, 49.

The Little Blue Food Truck now travels Minnesota selling the Blue Barn’s
greatest hits. To make Nashville-style hot chicken on a stick, Ms. Shimp
brines tenders in buttermilk spiced with cayenne, paprika and cumin,
rolls the meat in cornflakes and deep-fries it, then serves it with
pickles and a slice of white bread. Chicken in a waffle cone is
Instagram catnip: a quilted cone layered with tenders and sausage gravy,
sprinkled with chopped parsley and stabbed with a
fork.

Minnesotans who miss the fair have messaged Ms. Shimp to ask if she’ll

in early August. Dozens of neighbors came to his front yard in Rosemount
to buy Blue Barn food, with the request that “people remember social
distancing and wear masks,” said Mr. Mathisen, 35.

In Des Moines, Brenda Smith Parish of Brenda Smith Concessions arrives
at her Crazy Taters trailer at 8 a.m. every Friday to chop tomatoes for
gyros and make sugar water for her state-fair lemonade. By 10:30, cars
are lined up in the drive-through she has created behind her parents’
catering business.

In April, faced with the prospect of a fair-less summer, Ms. Smith
Parish set up with just corn dogs and lemonade, sent out a social-media
blast and hoped people would come. “And, I mean, they came,” she said.
She expanded the menu to 20 or so items and created a website,
FairFoodFridays.com, to take preorders through Shopify.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now, 500 to 600 cars show up each week for food from Crazy Taters and
her parents’ stands, All American Grill and Turkey Time. An acoustic
guitarist plays on a flatbed trailer as drivers roll down their windows
to accept handoffs of pickle dogs, turkey legs and deep-fried Oreos.

“I started this thinking, if I could just make my rent and my car
payment, I’m good with that,” said Ms. Smith Parish, 46. “I didn’t
expect this.” She has made nearly as much money as she would have in her
typical season at the [Iowa State Fair](https://www.iowastatefair.org/),
[Tulsa State Fair](https://www.tulsastatefair.com/) and [Des Moines
Downtown Farmers’
Market](https://www.dsmpartnership.com/desmoinesfarmersmarket/), all of
which were canceled, though the Farmers’ Market started its own
drive-through in early August.

Many vendors aren’t doing as well. Russell Goetze and his two brothers
usually tow all five soft-serve trailers for Goertze’s Dairy Kone (their
father added the “r” when he founded the business in 1967, to help
customers pronounce the name) to six state fairs a year, mostly along
the East Coast.

This year, Russell Goetze, 58, has been able to park one Dairy Kone
trailer and his sausage stand, Lenny’s, at the [Howard County
Fairgrounds](https://howardcountyfairmd.com/) in West Friendship, Md.,
selling cones, shakes, corn dogs and sausage sandwiches, but is making
barely enough to cover basic bills. “It’s a very trying time,” he said.

The Dallas chef Abel Gonzales said he usually earns 80 percent of his
annual revenue in just 24 days in September and October, selling
deep-fried foods at the [State Fair of Texas](https://bigtex.com/). His
signature is deep-fried butter: Wrap bread dough around a slab of
butter, freeze it and fry it. The dough crisps and the butter liquefies.

“You bite into it, and the butter gets all over the place,” said Mr.
Gonzales, 50. “It’s fun.”

Mr. Gonzales is offering a few fair-food items, including fried peanut
butter, jelly and banana sandwiches, at [Cocina
Italiano](https://cocinaitaliano.com/), his restaurant in the city, but
he knows the math won’t add up. Last year, the State Fair of Texas
pulled in 2.5 million visitors.

“I’m not going to make those numbers,” he said. “But I have a very
strong support system, and I have a restaurant. I’m thinking about the
people that depend on the fair, everybody from my crew to the guys who
run the rides. Just the ripple effect of the fair not happening. It’s
heartbreaking.”

Some fairs are organizing events for vendors. The Wisconsin State Fair’s
Fair Food Drive-Thru, which ran weekends through Aug. 16, invited
customers to drive around the Milwaukee Mile, the city’s 144-year-old
racetrack, to order from 14 vendors, like Mille’s Italian Sausage,
Kora’s Cookie Dough and Original Cream Puffs. The towering cream puffs
have been a fixture at the fair since 1924.

Amalia Hetzer, of Cudahy, Wis., usually runs the Cream Puff 5K race, 3.1
miles around the fairgrounds with the promise of a cream puff at the
finish line. “The cream is that buttery, not super-sweet cream,” she
said. “It’s just so good.”

This year, Ms. Hetzer, 35, completed the virtual race: She paid $33 to
run, then received three cream puffs at a curbside pickup location.
Because her mother also ran the race, they got six, which they ate with
family at a park.

Sharing, after all, is part of the fair spirit — as an industry group
called [Oregon Dairy Women](http://oregondairywomen.com/) can attest.
