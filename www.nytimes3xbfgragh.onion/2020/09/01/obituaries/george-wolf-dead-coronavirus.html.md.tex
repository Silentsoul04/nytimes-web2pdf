Evil, Dies at
92}\label{george-wolf-caring-neighbor-who-once-glimpsed-the-face-of-evil-dies-at-92}}

Mr. Wolf escaped the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and built a life
as a garment manufacturer and lover of music in New York City. He was
infected with the novel coronavirus.

George Wolf's family was drawn to the wild cheering and boom of drums
that cascaded through the streets from the direction of
\href{https://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle-for-visitors}{Prague Castle}
on March 15, 1939.

A German soldier heard them speaking to each other in his own language,
and with one smiling swoop, he lifted the 11-year-old schoolboy from
Brno onto the roof of a military truck.

``Little boy, have you ever seen our Führer?'' the soldier exclaimed,
pointing to a man waving from a third-floor window in the castle. It was
Adolf Hitler.

The soldier did not know that the family was Jewish: They had slipped
into Prague a few days earlier to collect exit visas, and would soon
flee to the safety of Switzerland.

Mr. Wolf, however, would carry that snapshot, the instant when his
country was devoured by tyranny, for the rest of his long life.

``It was a very strange feeling,'' said Mr. Wolf, during an interview a
few years ago filmed by a friend. ``It was the end of the world as we
knew it.''

Mr. Wolf, a retired garment manufacturer who was active in
\href{https://www.bluecardfund.org/}{the Blue Card}, a charity that aids
Holocaust survivors, died at the Dawn Greene Hospice in Manhattan on
June 28, his friends and neighbors said. He was 92.

Mr. Wolf learned in late March that he had the novel coronavirus, a
condition compounded by advanced prostate cancer. Over the next several
months he was transferred between the hospital and a nursing home,
eventually settling at the hospice for the last 48 hours of his life,
according to four neighbors who monitored his care.

George Egon Wolf was born on Nov. 16, 1927, to Egon Wolf, a prosperous
textile merchant and Social Democrat, and his wife Trudy, in Brno, a
southern Czech city then home to a flourishing community of around
12,000 Jews.

After Berlin fell, Mr. Wolf headed to Nuremberg, where he served as a
translator during the war crimes trials. In 1946, at 19, he boarded a
ship to New York, where he started his business and married Beth
Horelick, a gifted pianist.

Mr. Wolf was a voracious reader, a keen listener and a witty
conversationalist who surrounded himself with artists, musicians,
dancers and poets. Above all, he embraced the role of neighbor, and he
opened his 16th-floor apartment on Central Park West, with its panoramic
views of the park, to friends, many of them fellow tenants he had met in
the laundry room or lobby.

\href{https://www.sarahgrunstein.com/bio.html}{Sarah Grunstein}, a
concert pianist, moved there four years ago. When she opened her front
door, she found a notecard from Mr. Wolf that read: ``I hear you are a
concert pianist and love cats. Welcome to the building. I too love
music, the piano, and cats.''

Another neighbor and
friend,\href{http://www.danceatlaguardiahs.org/html/joey_r__smith.html}{Joey
Smith}, a choreographer and teacher, remembers Mr. Wolf as puckish and
oblivious of his age. He drove his Mercedes into his 90s, and got a
special kick out of parking it wherever he liked, thanks to a
handicapped permit still registered to his wife, who had died in 2015 at
85.

The day before Mr. Wolf died, Ms. Grunstein performed an audience-of-one
recital for him that he watched on a propped-up iPad. She planned to
deliver another performance the next day, this time looping in several
of their mutual friends, on Zoom.

Mr. Wolf died about an hour before she was scheduled to start.

The show went on. Ms. Grunstein began by reciting the Mourner's Kaddish,
tuneless and grave, quite unlike the man being honored.

She quickly moved on to one of his favorite Bach works, the lilting
opening Aria of the ``Goldberg'' Variations.
