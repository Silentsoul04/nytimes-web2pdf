# These Scientists Are Giving Themselves D.I.Y. Coronavirus Vaccines

Impatient for a coronavirus vaccine, dozens of scientists around the

In April, more than three months before any [coronavirus
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/health/9-drug-companies-pledge-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
would enter [large clinical
trials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/health/moderna-vaccine-covid.html),
the mayor of a picturesque island town in the Pacific Northwest invited
a microbiologist friend to vaccinate him.

The exchange occurred on the mayor’s Facebook page, to the horror of
several Friday Harbor residents following it.

“Should I pop up and get your vaccine started?????,” wrote Johnny Stine,
who runs North Coast Biologics, a Seattle biotech company with a focus
on antibodies. “Don’t worry — I’m immune — I have boosted myself five
times with my vaccine.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Sounds good,” Farhad Ghatan, the mayor, wrote after a few follow-up
questions.

Several residents interjected skepticism in the exchange. They were
swatted down by the mayor, who defended his friend of 25 years as a
“pharmaceutical scientist on the forefront.” When residents raised
additional concerns — about Mr. Stine’s credentials and the unfairness
of encouraging him to visit San Juan Island despite travel
[restrictions](https://mynorthwest.com/1815668/san-juan-county-council-bans-visitors/?)
— Mr. Stine lobbed back vulgar insults. (The geekiest and least R-rated:
“I hope your lung epithelial cells over express ACE2 so you die more
expeditiously from nCoV19.”)

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Several residents reported all of this to a variety of law enforcement
and regulatory agencies. In June, the Washington attorney general [filed
a
lawsuit](https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-files-lawsuit-against-seattle-business-marketed-and-sold-covid-19)
against Mr. Stine not only for pitching the mayor with unsupported
claims, but also for administering his unproven vaccine to about 30
people, charging each $400. In May, the Food and Drug Administration
sent a
[letter](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/north-coast-biologics-607532-05212020)
warning Mr. Stine to stop “misleadingly” representing his product.

Although his promotional tactics were unusual, Mr. Stine was far from
the only scientist creating experimental coronavirus vaccines for
themselves, family, friends and other interested parties. Dozens of
scientists around the world have done it, with wildly varying methods,
affiliations and claims.

The most impressively credentialed effort is the [Rapid Deployment
Vaccine Collaborative](https://radvac.org/vaccine/), or RaDVaC, which
boasts the famous Harvard geneticist George Church among its 23 [listed
collaborators](https://radvac.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/White-Paper-SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-ver-3-0-1.pdf).
(The research, however, is not happening on Harvard’s campus: “While
professor Church’s lab works on a number of Covid-19 research projects,
he has assured Harvard Medical School that work related to the RaDVaC
vaccine is not being done in his lab,” a spokeswoman for Harvard Medical
School
said.)

Each D.I.Y. effort is motivated, at least in part, by the same idea:
Exceptional times demand exceptional actions. If scientists have the
skills and gumption to assemble a vaccine on their own, the logic goes,
they should do it. Defenders say that as long as they are measured about
their claims and transparent about their process, we could all benefit
from what they learn.

But critics say that no matter how well-intentioned, these scientists
aren’t likely to learn anything useful because their vaccines are not
being put to the true test of randomized and placebo-controlled studies.
What’s more, taking these vaccines could cause harm — whether from
serious immune reactions and other side effects, or offering a false
sense of protection.

“Take it yourself and there is not much anyone can or should do,” said
Jeffrey Kahn, the director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of
Bioethics. But once a person starts encouraging other people to try an
unproven vaccine, “you’re headed right back to the days of [patent
medicine](https://www.hagley.org/research/digital-exhibits/history-patent-medicine)
and quackery,” he said, referring to a time when remedies were widely
sold with colorful but misleading
promises.

The RaDVac vaccine effort, first reported on by [MIT Technology
Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/29/1005720/george-church-diy-coronavirus-vaccine/),
is different from Mr. Stine’s project in two important ways. No one
involved plans to charge for the vaccine. And unlike Mr. Stine’s
expletive-laden Facebook rants, RaDVaC has a [59-page scientific
document](https://radvac.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/White-Paper-SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-ver-3-0-1.pdf)
to explain how it works and to guide others who might want to mix up the
vaccine formulation on their own.

“The white paper is quite impressive,” said Avery August, an
immunologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., who is not involved
with RaDVaC.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the impetus of both projects is similar. In March, as Preston **
Estep, a genome scientist who lives in the Boston area, was reading
about people dying amid the pandemic, he vowed not to sit complacently
on the sidelines. He emailed some chemists, biologists, professors and
doctors he knew to see whether any were interested in creating their own
vaccine. Soon they had devised a formula for a [peptide
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html)
that could be administered through a spritz in the nose.

“It’s very simple,” Dr. Estep said. “It consists of five ingredients you
could mix together in a physician’s office.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The key ingredient: tiny bits of viral proteins, or peptides, which the
scientists ordered online. If all went well, the peptides would train
the immune system to defend against the coronavirus, even with no actual
virus present.

In late April, Dr. Estep joined several collaborators in a lab as they
stirred the concoction and sprayed it in their nostrils. Dr. Church, a
longtime mentor to Dr. Estep, said he took it alone in his bathroom to
maintain social-distancing precautions.

Dr. Estep soon gave the vaccine to his 23-year-old son, and other
collaborators also shared it with their family members. So far, no one
has reported anything worse than a stuffy nose and a mild headache, Dr.
Estep said. He has also refined the recipe, removing and adding peptides
as new coronavirus research has emerged. So far, he has sprayed eight
versions into his nose.

A traditional drug development workflow begins with mouse or other
animal studies. For RaDVaC, Dr. Estep said, “we are the animals.”

But without rigorous clinical trials, Dr. August said, there’s no
reliable way to know if it is safe or effective. He said he feared that
the scientists’ prestigious credentials might imply otherwise.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Church said that he respected the traditional evaluation process but
that there should also be room for “pre-research,” and that most of what
[he had been involved
with](https://wyss.harvard.edu/team/core-faculty/george-church/)
throughout his career — including editing [genes in human
cells](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/WeizmannCompass/sections/qa/prof-george-church)
— was considered “fringe” at first.

As of last week, Dr. Estep said, about 30 people in the United States,
Sweden, Germany, China and Britain had taken the vaccine. He said a
university professor in Brazil had told him he was considering making it
in his lab and distributing it for
free.

There is a long history of scientists openly testing vaccines on
themselves and their children, but in recent decades it has become less
common, according to Susan E. Lederer, a medical historian at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. What’s ethically and legally acceptable
for testing and distributing your own medical product varies by
institution and by
country.

        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

In August, the Scientific Research Institute for Biological Safety
Problems, a government institution in Kazakhstan,
[announced](https://www.biosafety.kz/en/uncategorized/%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC-%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B7/)
that seven employees had become the first people to try the Covid-19
vaccine they were developing.
[Russian](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine-race-ethics/2020/06/04/ce8b9464-a598-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html)
and [Chinese
scientists](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/self-experimentation-in-the-time-of-covid-19-67805)
affiliated with government and academic institutions have made similar
pronouncements amid the pandemic.

The problem with Mr. Stine’s product, according to Attorney General Bob
Ferguson of Washington, is not that he took it. It’s that he “sold this
so-called vaccine to people in Washington who are frightened and more
apt to look for a miracle cure in the midst of a worldwide pandemic,”
Mr. Ferguson said in [a
statement](https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-files-lawsuit-against-seattle-business-marketed-and-sold-covid-19).
The
[lawsui](https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/2020_06_12Complaint.pdf)t
also cites Mr. Stine’s unsupported safety and effectiveness claims.

In March, a few months after he said he vaccinated himself and his two
teenage sons, he posted [an ad on the Facebook page for North Coast
Biologics](https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/StineSMPosts.pdf).
After
[decades](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050124005220/en/Spaltudaq-Corporation-Biotech-Company-Started-Accelerator-Newest)
of working with antibodies, Mr. Stine said in an interview, he knew that
making a vaccine should be “pretty goddamn easy.”

He described a job that sounded a bit like writing Hollywood screenplays
that never become movies. He makes antibodies that could be used against
various pathogens and sells them to companies that could use them to
develop drugs, but they probably won’t. According to the Washington
attorney general’s suit, Mr. Stine’s company was administratively
dissolved in 2012.

To make his vaccine, he used a genetic sequence for the spike protein on
the outside of the coronavirus to make a synthetic version. He put it in
a saline solution, injected himself just under the surface of the skin
of his upper arm and then took a so-called titer test to look for
antibodies in his bloodstream. “It took me 12 days from downloading the
sequence to being titer positive,” he said.

In his Facebook ad, he claimed that this left him immune to the virus
and offered “interested parties” the opportunity to “pay $400/person.”

As part of [an
agreement](https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/2020_06_22ConsentDecree.pdf)
that Mr. Stine [eventually
struck](https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ag-ferguson-wins-refunds-victims-covid-19-vaccine-scam)
with prosecutors, he must refund all 30 people who had taken his
vaccine.

Mr. Stine seemed amused by this, insisting that few people are likely to
apply for a refund. His fee, he said, barely covered travel costs, and
often he didn’t charge.

A man in his 60s in Montana, who asked to remain anonymous for privacy
concerns, said he flew Mr. Stine out to inoculate him and his family.
Now, he said, they have been able to return to “normal behavior,” such
as having lunch with friends whose jobs put them at high risk for
exposure. The man even joined Mr. Stine to visit a police officer friend
in Washington State who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and was “on
death’s door.” According to all three who were present, no one wore a
mask. And Mr. Stine sat close to the sick officer in an enclosed space
as he gave him a treatment.

Mr. Stine says his vaccine is similar to a recombinant vaccine [being
developed by the University of
Pittsburgh](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200402144508.htm)
in Pennsylvania. He also claims that a shot will not only protect people
against the virus, but also treat those who have it. Dr. Louis Falo, a
lead researcher on University of Pittsburgh’s effort, said he was
skeptical that Mr. Stine’s vaccine could be safe or effective based on
how it was assembled. Even if it was, he said, it’s unlikely it would
help sick people.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In the 1990s, Mr. Stine worked for [Patrick
Gray](https://www.pascalbiosciences.com/company/), a molecular biologist
who contributed to the discovery of a hepatitis B vaccine and is now the
[chief executive of a biotech
company](https://www.pascalbiosciences.com/company/).

Dr. Gray said in an interview that the science Mr. Stine published at
[Icos](https://xconomy.com/seattle/2009/11/18/the-icos-alumni-where-are-they-now/),
the biotech company where they worked together, was “sound” but that the
young scientist had a penchant for making too much of too little.
“Johnny was in a hurry to publish his work and advance his career,” he
said. “We often insisted on more confirmation and more controls.”

“Regarding his current scientific efforts, I don’t believe Johnny is a
‘scam artist,’ but he has ignored F.D.A. regulations necessary for
drug development,” he wrote in an email. “It’s just not possible for an
individual like Johnny to create a viable vaccine.”

The mayor of Friday Harbor said he regretted responding to Mr. Stine’s
message on his Facebook wall, instead of privately. But he does not see
why he should apologize for accepting his friend’s formulation for free.
“I’d rather have the chance of having some protection than no protection
at all and waiting and waiting,” Mr. Ghatan said.

The controversy, however, has derailed their plans to meet, he said. But
if another opportunity arises to get the jab, he said, “I would.”
