\emph{Good morning.}

Over the past few weeks, hundreds of fires in California have
incinerated more than \href{https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/}{a
million and a half acres}, destroyed over 3,000 structures and taken
seven lives.

And it's still early in the wildfire season.

My colleague Thomas Fuller
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/california-fires-wildfires.html}{recently
captured the mood in the Bay Area}, a region engulfed in fire and choked
by smokey haze four years in a row. ``First there was the coronavirus,
then the threat of fires and power outages, and now the smoke,'' he
wrote.

According to the \href{https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/}{California Air Resources
Board}, the state agency tasked with tracking and maintaining healthy
air quality throughout the state, one quarter of California is
classified as under very high or extreme fire threat and more than 25
percent of the state's population lives in these high fire-risk areas.
Even more people are vulnerable to plumes of smoke that can travel long
distances and hover over populated areas.

Understanding the quality of the air we breathe is vital and the
information is readily available at our fingertips, according to a group
of experts I spoke to from the agency.

Here are four takeaways from our conversation.

\textbf{We are collecting more information on air quality than ever
before.} According to CARB, for 50 years California has maintained one
of the most extensive air-monitoring networks in the world. There are
over 250 monitoring sites in the state alone.

To get the latest pollution readings, the board recommends using
\href{https://www.airnow.gov/}{AirNow}, a website and app run by the
Environmental Protection Agency. AirNow has
\href{https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat=38.5712128\&lng=-121.4021632\&zoom=10}{a
separate fire and smoke map} that uses portable sensors to track smoke
plumes as they travel around the state. If you don't have access to the
internet, local newspapers also publish general air quality levels for
that day. Since this article was published, several readers also
recommended \href{https://www.purpleair.com/map\#1/14.8/-30}{PurpleAir},
a worldwide map showing live air quality readings. PurpleAir uses a
network of inexpensive sensors that are purchased and installed by
members of the community.

AirNow and PurpleAir use the Air Quality Index, or A.Q.I., a measure of
air quality from 0 to 500 that is composed of six categories, from
``good'' to ``hazardous.'' An A.Q.I. of 50 or below represents good air
quality, while an A.Q.I. of over 300 represents hazardous air quality
that is unhealthy for any person to breathe.

\textbf{Check the index daily, the way you would check the weather.}
It's generally a good idea to check the index before engaging in outdoor
activities, said Webster Tasat, a manager from CARB's air quality
planning and science division.

People should also think about whether they fall into a sensitive group.
``People who are in sensitive groups are especially vulnerable to air
pollution,'' said Bonnie Holmes-Gen, a health expert at CARB. This
includes pregnant women, children, seniors and people that have existing
respiratory conditions such as asthma or heart conditions and
pre-existing respiratory illnesses.

When the A.Q.I. reaches 100 or more, outdoor air is no longer safe for
sensitive groups.

\textbf{Air pollution affects people all year, not just during wildfire
season.} On Aug. 24, smoke from wildfires raging in the Bay Area made
the air quality
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/california-fires-wildfires.html}{four
times worse than in Beijing or New Delhi}. Three days later, the
E.P.A'.s smoke map showed much of Northern California buried under a
dark gray haze.

Mr. Tasat said that from Aug. 18 to 24, the daily average particle
pollution level in California was about 500 percent higher than it was
the same week in 2019, largely because of the wildfires.

\end{itemize}

However, California is subject to air pollution throughout the year.
Sometimes there are high levels of both ozone and particle pollution
during a particular season. Ozone pollution tends to be worse in the
summer, Mr. Tasat said.

Fine particles in the soot, ash and dust of wildfire smoke make up
particle pollutants, which can be inhaled by the lungs. During summer,
the mixture of smoke pollutants and hotter temperatures generate what
Ms. Holmes-Gen calls a ``double whammy of ozone pollution and particle
pollution.''

``One unique aspect of this time period, unfortunately, is that people
can be affected by multiple types of air pollution,'' she said.

\textbf{You can reduce your exposure to air pollution.} The effects of
air pollution can be mild, like eye and throat irritation, or serious,
requiring hospitalization for heart or respiratory issues. Smoke and
pollution can cause inflammation of the lung tissue and increase the
vulnerability of infections, Ms. Holmes-Gen said.

The most effective way to reduce your exposure to air pollution is to
stay indoors with windows and doors closed, said Melanie Turner, a
public information officer for the California Air Resources Board.
Air-conditioning should remain on continuously, not the auto cycle,
which cycles on and off, Ms. Turner said. It's also helpful to close the
fresh air intake so that smoke doesn't get inside the house. If your
system allows for it, it's recommended to install a high efficiency air
filter, classified as MERV 13 or higher. Portable air cleaners can also
reduce indoor particulate matter in smaller spaces, like individual
rooms.
\href{https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/air-cleaners-ozone-products/california-certified-air-cleaning-devices}{CARB
certifies all air cleaners}that are currently sold in California to
ensure they meet its regulations for ozone emissions.
