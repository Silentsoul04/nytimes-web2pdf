Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the
chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, said Monday that she would
subpoena Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, for documents she said he
had withheld from Congress related to mail delays and communications
with the Trump campaign.

The subpoena is the latest sign of escalating tension between the new
postmaster general — [an ally of President Trump and Republican
megadonor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/general-louis-dejoy-postmaster.html)
— and leading Democrats, who have accused him of injecting dysfunction
into the United States Postal Service before the November election. The
changes Mr. DeJoy has instituted have resulted in confusion and
coincided with a slowdown in delivery times and a concerted effort by
the president to baselessly attack mail-in voting as fraudulent, arguing
that it hurts his re-election chances.

In a statement, the Postal Service said it was “surprised and confused”
by the committee’s subpoena.

“We will continue to cooperate with the oversight committees in both the
House and Senate, and we fully intend to comply with our obligations
under the law,” the statement said.

The statement also said mail performance was beginning to improve after
suffering declines during Mr. DeJoy’s first months on the job, when he
put in place cost-cutting measures, including a more regimented schedule
for running mail trucks at specified times. Documents released Monday
afternoon by the Postal Service on Monday show an improvement in
delivery times, but not a full return to the level of service provided
before Mr. DeJoy implemented his changes.

For months, members of Congress have sought documents from Mr. DeJoy
about delays in election mail, the removal of machinery and how he has
chosen to run the agency. Internal documents show some aspects of mail
performance had fallen by as much as 8 percent since he took the helm of
the agency.

Democrats have raised concerns that Mr. DeJoy is interfering with the
mail as part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to sow distrust in voting
by mail ahead of a pandemic-era election in which [mail-in ballots will
play an outsize
role](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/11/us/politics/vote-by-mail-us-states.html).
Among their requests for documents: information about the removal of
hundreds of letter-sorting machines and the limiting of overtime — both
actions denounced by union officials.

Mr. DeJoy has yet to provide any documents to Congress since a [hearing
last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/politics/louis-dejoy-post-office-hearing.html)
of Ms. Maloney’s committee, during which Democrats grilled the
postmaster general and some called for him to resign.
