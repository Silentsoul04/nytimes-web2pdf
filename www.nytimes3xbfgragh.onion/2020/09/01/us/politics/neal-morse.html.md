# Richard Neal, Powerful House Democrat, Fights Off Challenge From His Left

</div>

Mr. Neal had faced a well-funded young progressive, Alex Morse, in a
race that typified the tensions between Democratic leadership in
Washington and upstart activists on the
left.

Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, one of the Democratic
Party’s most powerful committee chairmen, beat back a challenge on
Tuesday from a progressive insurgent in a race that embodied the clash
between the party’s leadership in Washington and a younger generation of
activists on the left.

Mr. Neal’s victory over Alex Morse, a 31-year-old mayor who had
endorsements from a number of high-profile progressive politicians and
groups, [including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New
York](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/politics/alex-morse-richard-neal-aoc.html),
broke a string of progressive triumphs that have recently upended senior
House Democrats from New York to Missouri.

Late Tuesday, Mr. Neal was leading Mr. Morse [by about 20 percentage
points](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/09/01/us/elections/results-massachusetts-house-district-1-democrat-primary-election.html).

As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over
the tax code and other legislation that raises revenue for the
government, Mr. Neal was the most prominent target of progressive
activists in Democratic primaries this year. But he was also one of the
most prepared and best financed, with a war chest of nearly $4 million
and a team of allied outside groups to help him fend off a flood of
money and resources into the district in support of Mr. Morse.

Mr. Neal, 71, was endorsed by Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House,
who has defended many Democratic incumbents against challenges from the
left. Mr. Neal has been in Congress since 1989, the year Mr. Morse was
born.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Unlike some other House Democrats who have lost primaries in recent
years, Mr. Neal has fewer upscale liberals in his district, which covers
a range of cities and small towns in Western Massachusetts.

While the race mostly turned on the policy differences between the two
candidates — Mr. Morse, the mayor of Holyoke, campaigned on an agenda
that included liberal environmental and health care policies that Mr.
Neal criticized as largely unrealistic — events took [a stunning
turn](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/23/us/politics/alex-morse-massachusetts.html)
last month when the student newspaper at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst, published anonymous complaints from some College
Democrats who claimed Mr. Morse had acted inappropriately with students.

Mr. Morse, who is gay and taught as a visiting lecturer at the
university until last year, acknowledged having consensual relationships
with students over the years, none of whom were in his classes, he said.
But his support on the left began to crumble, as progressive groups said
they would stop campaigning for him and the university opened an
investigation into his conduct.

But then the allegations started to unravel, leading Mr. Morse to accuse
Mr. Neal and his allies in the Massachusetts Democratic Party of working
behind the scenes on a homophobic smear campaign against him. Mr. Neal
denied any involvement.

Reporting by The Intercept uncovered
[messages](https://theintercept.com/2020/08/12/alex-morse-college-democrats-chats/)
between some of the students showing that they had discussed how they
might damage Mr. Morse’s campaign, with one student suggesting that it
might help him get a job with Mr. Neal after graduation.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The state party acknowledged that it had provided minor legal advice to
the College Democrats, who first made their allegations in a letter to
Mr. Morse that cited vague complaints about how he made some students
feel uncomfortable.

Once the messages surfaced, the groups and activists who had pulled
their support for Mr. Morse got back in the race on his behalf. His
campaign said it raised more than $410,000 in the weeks after the
student paper published its report and received 800 queries from people
hoping to volunteer.

But in the end, it was not enough to overcome the power of incumbency
and clout that Mr. Neal had amassed in his 16 terms in the House.
