LOS ANGELES — Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, having resettled in
California, on Wednesday unveiled new Hollywood careers.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have founded a yet-to-be-named production
company and signed a multiyear deal with Netflix, which will pay them to
make documentaries, docu-series, feature films, scripted shows and
children’s programming — giving the couple a global platform six months
after their [dramatic
decampment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/09/world/europe/harry-meghan-royal-exit.html)
from the House of Windsor.

Harry and Meghan may appear on camera in documentary programming. But
she has no plans to return to acting, according to a representative. She
[last
appeared](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/25/arts/television/meghan-markle-leaves-suits-finale.html#:~:text=An%20earlier%20version%20of%20this,final%20episode%20of%20the%20series.)
in the cable drama “Suits” in 2018.

“Our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives
hope,” the couple said in a statement. “As new parents, making
inspirational family programming is also important to us.” They added
that Netflix’s “unprecedented reach will help us share impactful content
that unlocks action.” Their productions will be exclusive to Netflix,
which has 193 million subscribers worldwide.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is unclear how much Harry and Meghan will be paid, given their lack
of producing experience. A Netflix spokeswoman declined to comment.

The streaming service, however, is known for backing up Brink’s trucks
when it wants to be in business with high-profile people, particularly
when other entertainment companies also want their services. In recent
months, Harry and Meghan have quietly talked with Disney and Apple. Two
executives involved in those discussions said representatives for the
couple at one point were seeking a deal in the neighborhood of $100
million. Variety reported last month that the couple had also [met with
NBCUniversal](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-pitch-meetings-tv-project-1234734074/).

Harry and Meghan have been living in the Los Angeles area since March,
staying for a time at a Beverly Hills mansion owned by [Tyler
Perry](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/28/movies/tyler-perry-madea.html)
and [delivering food to the
needy](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-04-16/prince-harry-meghan-meals-archie-coronavirus)
during the early part of the coronavirus pandemic. They soon filed an
[invasion of privacy
lawsuit](https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1286426962974715906?s=20)
against tabloid photographers, saying that paparazzi had flown drones
overhead to capture images of their son, Archie, who turned 1 in May.
Harry, 35, and Meghan, 39, have since bought a [$14.7 million home in
Montecito](https://variety.com/2020/dirt/heirs-heiresses/meghan-markle-prince-harry-buy-14-7-million-montecito-compound-1234733871/),
an oceanside enclave about an hour north of Malibu where Oprah Winfrey
and Ellen DeGeneres also have estates.

“We’re incredibly proud they have chosen Netflix as their creative home
and are excited about telling stories with them that can help build
resilience and increase understanding for audiences everywhere,” Ted
Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive and chief content officer, said
in a statement.

Netflix is under pressure to keep its pipelines flowing as it competes
for viewers with Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Hulu, Peacock and
the traditional broadcast networks. [Family
programming](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/11/business/media/netflix-children-movies-streaming.html)
is particularly important to Netflix, and Harry and Meghan already have
an animated series in development that is focused on inspiring women.
Last week, Netflix released “[Rising
Phoenix](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rising_phoenix),” a
documentary about the Paralympic Games; Harry, who founded the Invictus
Games for wounded veterans, appears in the film.

Content centered on social messages — racial justice, gender equity,
environmental stewardship *—* has been hot in Hollywood for some time,
and Netflix and Participant Media, founded by the eBay billionaire Jeff
Skoll, have been at the center.

Participant and Netflix backed Ava DuVernay’s acclaimed 2019
mini-series, “When They See Us,” which depicted the [excruciating
toll](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/30/arts/television/when-they-see-us-netflix.html)
that persecution and incarceration had on the teenage boys known as the
Central Park Five. In 2018, Netflix struck a deal with Barack and
Michelle Obama to produce shows and films. That partnership in March
yielded “Crip Camp,” a feel-good documentary about the [origins of the
disability rights
movement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/movies/crip-camp-review.html)
**** that is an early favorite to win the 2021 Oscar for best nonfiction
film.

Netflix executives have said the Obamas have also proved to be valuable
as a magnet for other deals: In Hollywood, the cool kids want to be
around other cool kids.

“The value of this signing to Netflix is unquantifiable,” Jonathan
Shalit, chairman of InterTalent Rights Group, a London agency, said in
an email. “Never before has a real-life royal of this magnitude gone
commercial and to Hollywood.”

Meghan and Harry, the second son of Prince Charles, abruptly announced
in January that they planned to step back from their royal duties, seek
financial independence and spend part of the year living in North
America. It triggered the most serious crisis for the British royal
family since the death of Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, in a car crash
in 1997. The news media labeled the fracas Megxit.

After emotionally charged negotiations, Queen Elizabeth II granted the
couple’s wishes in return for their agreeing [not to
use](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/21/world/europe/harry-meghan-sussexroyal.html)
their most exalted titles, His Royal Highness and Her Royal Highness.
The couple also agreed to give up public funding — setting off a tabloid
guessing game about how they would finance their lifestyle, including
paying for security.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Harry and Meghan used to draw some income from the [Duchy of
Cornwall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/26/world/europe/harry-meghan-charles-duchy-of-cornwall.html),
a hereditary estate owned by Prince Charles, but that ended with their
departure from Britain. Harry also inherited several million dollars
from his late mother. Before their [2018
marriage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/04/06/style/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-wedding.html),
Meghan, then Meghan Markle, worked as an actress in “Suits.”

In June, they signed a deal with the Harry Walker Agency for speaking
engagements, with per-speech fees estimated at $1 million and topics
(for Harry) including mental health and grieving. (Harry Walker also
represents the Obamas.) There has been [widespread
speculation](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8678495/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-set-offered-Spotify-megadeal-exclusive-podcasts.html)
that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could copy another part of the
Obamas’ playbook and make a podcast deal with Spotify. A Spotify
spokesman declined to comment.

The production company being established by Harry and Meghan will
operate independently from their charitable foundation, which is called
Archewell. The couple shut down their previous philanthropic endeavor,
SussexRoyal, in March after they agreed to stop using the term “royal”
for commercial or charitable activities.

Harry and Meghan — beloved by millions of fans, who see them as daring
and modern, and reviled by an equally vehement faction, which sees their
royalty-spurning actions as unbecoming — have long been expected to set
up shop in Hollywood. Before he gave up his Royal Highness title, Harry
signed on for a [project with Ms.
Winfrey](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/prince-harry-partner-oprah-apple-tv-mental-health-series-1200852)
and Apple TV+ involving mental health. And Meghan provided narration for
“Elephant,” a nature documentary that arrived on Disney+ in April.

In January, a video resurfaced of Harry that had been recorded by a fan
in July 2019 at the London premiere for “The Lion King.” It caught the
prince [talking up his wife’s vocal
talent](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/even-princes-have-to-hustle)
to Robert A. Iger, who was then Disney’s chief executive. As with
seemingly everything related to Meghan, the video [created a stir
online](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a31965232/prince-harry-meghan-markle-disney-voiceover-pitch/),
prompting representatives to clarify that the duchess had been
approached to narrate “Elephant” before Harry’s red-carpet schmooze.
