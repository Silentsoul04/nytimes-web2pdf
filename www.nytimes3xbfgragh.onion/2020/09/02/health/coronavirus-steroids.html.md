International clinical trials published on Wednesday confirm the hope
that cheap, widely available steroid drugs can help seriously ill
patients survive Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.

Based on the new evidence, the World Health Organization [issued new
treatment
guidance](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Corticosteroids-2020.1),
strongly recommending steroids to treat severely and critically ill
patients, but not to those with mild disease.

“Clearly, now steroids are the standard of care,” said Dr. Howard C.
Bauchner, the editor-in-chief of JAMA, which published five papers about
the treatment.

The new studies include an analysis that [pooled data from seven
randomized clinical
trials](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.17023?guestAccessKey=ec87204d-c42d-4d34-bef5-077a40bc86b0&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=090220)
evaluating three steroids in more than 1,700 patients. The study
concluded that each of the three drugs reduced the risk of death.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

JAMA published that paper and three related studies, along with an
editorial describing the research as an “important step forward in the
treatment of patients with Covid-19.”

Corticosteroids should now be the first-line treatment for critically
ill patients, the authors said. The only other drug shown to be
effective in seriously ill patients, and only modestly at that, is
remdesivir.

Steroids like dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone are
often used by doctors to tamp down the body’s immune system, alleviating
inflammation, swelling and pain. Many Covid-19 patients die not of the
virus, but of the body’s overreaction to the
infection.

In June, researchers at Oxford University discovered that dexamethasone
improved survival rates in severely ill patients. Researchers had hoped
that other inexpensive steroids might help these patients.

The evidence had been lacking: After the Oxford researchers made their
announcement, some clinical trials of steroids were halted, as doctors
were loathe to withhold what appeared to be an effective treatment from
study participants.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Steroids can have harmful side effects, especially in elderly patients,
who make up the majority of very ill coronavirus patients. The drugs may
leave patients vulnerable to other infections, may raise blood glucose
levels, and may cause confusion and delirium.

In the clinical trials, only the sickest patients were treated with
steroids, and it is not certain that those who are less ill will benefit
or be harmed. The optimal doses and duration of treatment also need to
be identified.

But over all, the scientists said, the new studies appeared to confirm
the promise of this class of drugs for patients severely ill with
Covid-19.

The studies “are like the second punch of a one-two punch,” said Dr.
Derek C. Angus, chair of the department of critical care medicine at the
University of Pittsburgh, who co-authored one of the new studies and the
analysis.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I had a big smile on my face when I saw the results,” Dr. Angus added.
“This is a case of, ‘A question asked, a question answered,’ and
that’s so rare.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The analysis of pooled data found that steroids were linked with a
one-third reduction in deaths among critically ill Covid-19 patients.
Dexamethasone produced a 36 percent drop in deaths in 1,282 patients
treated in three separate trials.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Hydrocortisone, tested in 374 patients in three trials, appeared to
reduce deaths by 31 percent, and a small trial of methylprednisolone in
47 patients resulted in a 9 percent drop in deaths. The analysis was
carried out by a W.H.O. working group that is making efforts to rapidly
evaluate Covid-19 therapies.

Taken together, the new studies will bolster confidence in the use of
steroids and address any lingering hesitancy on the part of some
physicians, said Dr. Todd Rice, an associate professor of medicine and
critical care physician at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.

In new guidance, the W.H.O. warned against indiscriminate use of
steroids, emphasizing that patients who are not severely ill are
unlikely to benefit and may suffer side effects. Unwarranted use could
deplete global supplies, depriving patients who genuinely need the
medications.

The health organization started work on its guidance in June, shortly
after Oxford University published a preliminary report of its findings,
partnering with investigators of seven clinical trials in order to
conduct a meta-analysis and provide additional evidence in the most
expeditious manner, W.H.O. officials said.

They characterized the quality of the evidence in favor of steroid
treatment for severely ill patients as one of “moderate certainty.”

Among the other studies published Wednesday was a Brazilian trial of 299
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome that compared
dexamethasone treatment with regular care. The steroid significantly
improved outcomes, increasing the number of days patients [were alive
and free of mechanical
ventilation](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.17021).

Another study in France [evaluated low doses of another steroid,
hydrocortisone](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.16761),
in 148 patients. Those receiving the drug were more likely to survive,
but the results were not statistically significant because the trial was
stopped early.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A third study tested varying hydrocortisone regimens in 400 seriously
ill Covid-19 patients in eight countries. It was also stopped
prematurely, but the researchers [concluded there was a strong
probability](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2020.17022)
that the treatment improved outcomes.

When the Oxford results were announced in June, physicians worldwide
started using dexamethasone. “I think there was some uncertainty about
whether the effect was real,” said Dr. Rice, who co-authored an
editorial accompanying the new papers in JAMA.

“This shows us steroids are clearly beneficial in this population and
should clearly be given, unless you absolutely can’t for some reason,
which needs to be a pretty rare occasion.”

The drug remdesivir modestly shortens time to recovery in critically ill
Covid-19 patients, he noted, but has not been shown to reduce
fatalities. “People are dying from this disease, and we want treatment
that we are confident will decrease mortality and save people’s lives,”
Dr. Rice said.
