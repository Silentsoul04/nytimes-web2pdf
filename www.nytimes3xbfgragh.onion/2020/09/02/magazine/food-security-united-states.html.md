In March, the photographer Brenda Ann Kenneally was visiting Troy, N.Y.,
when the coronavirus pandemic hit the East Coast. She grew up in the
area, bouncing among friends and group homes after her mother kicked her
out when she was 12. Kenneally has spent decades immersed in the
intimate lives of a group of upstate families who share her legacy,
using images to explore the way economic forces ravage people’s lives
for generations. “I knew every single layer of disadvantage they lived
on a daily basis would be exacerbated by Covid,” she says.

As April unfolded, Kenneally checked on friends in crowded apartments
and shelters in and around Troy, and for weeks she was the only person
wearing a mask. Stressors were so common — evictions, unemployment,
isolation — that Covid-19 hadn’t yet struck many of them as particularly
significant. But as jobs continued to disappear in New York and around
the country, Kenneally knew that millions of Americans were now being
thrown into the kind of precarity that the people she knew had long
endured. “It was the moment to connect the root causes of all the things
that people could be shamed for with what you see in front of the
camera,” she says. “The situations that define a life of scarcity were
becoming democratized.”

She returned to Queens, where she lives, packed up her pull camper and
enlisted Rafael Gonzalez, the father of her 26-year-old son, beginning
what would become a 92-day trip across the country documenting food
insecurity. She and Gonzalez met as homeless teenagers working for a
carnival, so they knew the
road.

The highways were quiet as they headed north. They visited Salvation
Armys and food pantries in Canandaigua, Utica and Buffalo. Kenneally
knocked on car windows and walked the lines. Every postindustrial town
and city they passed through looked abandoned. “You couldn’t tell if
they had been closed down because of globalization three decades ago or
Covid,” she says.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

They made a brief return to Troy before heading west. On Mother’s Day,
Kenneally joined the Stocklas family for a meal. Family members had
pooled their benefits from SNAP (the federal Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program — food stamps) to buy the food. “I’ve been watching
the Stocklases struggle to put dinner on the table for 15 years,”
Kenneally says. Kenneally’s mother was aided by food stamps after her
father left, and she used federal food benefits, too, especially when
raising her own son as a single mother.

Then Kenneally and Gonzalez left for Pennsylvania. From there to Gary,
Ind., to Chicago, charities and nonprofits were adjusting to new safety
protocols to deliver food. The Salvation Army has more than 7,600
centers of operation, and many waived eligibility requirements. Food
banks distribute to local pantries, which in turn get groceries directly
to people or to organizations that serve hot meals. Volunteers — many of
them senior citizens — were now at risk, so staff was scrambling to find
help while converting to curbside pickup. In Parma, Ohio, the school
district, like so many across the country, had essentially become its
own food bank. In Memphis, a woman became a distribution point for her
condominium complex, giving away boxed lunches that she retrieved from
her niece’s
school.

Precarity wasn’t new to Kenneally, but what was striking now was the
astonishing scale. Lines at food banks stretched to hundreds of cars,
some carrying people who had never sought food assistance before. In
Houston, Catholic Charities was providing food to as many as 2,000
people every six hours. The Mamie George Community Center there gave out
567,000 pounds of food in 2019; between March 18, 2020, and July 6, when
Kenneally arrived, the M.G.C.C. had already distributed 528,437 pounds.

At a time when the heat and the fear were rising, when Americans were
urged to keep distance from loved ones, when protesters — outdoors —
were risking their safety, strangers let Kenneally and Gonzalez, wearing
masks, into their homes and kitchens to watch them prepare their food
and eat. “They understood that telling their food-struggle story now and
even pre-Covid was important,” Kenneally says. She moved in close,
photographing this ordinary intimacy under extraordinary circumstances.
“I want you to feel like you are there, to go in there, to be
vulnerable and to honor the fact that these people are making themselves
vulnerable.”

**In 1936, Dorothea Lange** took what would become a world-famous
photograph of 32-year-old Florence Owens Thompson, in Nipomo, Calif. It
was early March, and Lange was speeding home to Berkeley, where she
lived. She glimpsed a handwritten sign that read “Pea-Pickers Camp,” but
at first she drove right past it.

She had spent that bitter cold February following migrant workers who
had fled the Dust Bowl and were following crops. Many were starving. By
1936, thousands were flooding into California every month, and police
officers were stationed at the state’s borders to turn back anyone
deemed a “transient.” Lange was taking photographs for the Resettlement
Administration, a New Deal agency that would soon change its name to the
Farm Security Administration, which relocated poor urban and rural
people into government-planned communities. The government’s goal was to
educate voters who hadn’t been so hard hit by the Great Depression and
didn’t know much about the degrees of suffering in their
midst.

After Lange passed the pea-pickers sign, she drove for another 20 miles,
wanting to believe, she later wrote in an article, that she already had
enough evidence of hardship, but she had an argument with herself:
“Dorothea, how about that camp back there? … Nobody could ask this of
you, now could they? … To turn back certainly is not necessary. Isn’t
this just one more of the same?” She turned back to see for
herself.

She found Thompson and three of her children huddled under a tattered,
dirty tent. “She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables
from the surrounding fields, and birds that the children killed,” Lange
wrote. “She seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she
helped me.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lange’s photographs of Thompson ran in The San Francisco News shortly
afterward. The public reaction to the image of an attractive mother and
her daughters was immediate: letters of concern, calls to action,
donations. The government assembled 20,000 pounds of emergency food, but
by the time it was shipped to that particular migrant camp, the woman
had already packed up her seven hungry children and pressed on. The
image, which eventually came to be titled “Migrant Mother,” circulated
widely and increased popular support for the New Deal programs that
evolved into what remains of our social safety net today. Until 1978,
her name — and that she was of Cherokee descent — remained unknown.

Our treatment of hunger as an emergency, rather than a symptom of
systemic inequities, has long informed our response to it, and as a
result, government programs have been designed to alleviate each peak
rather than to address the factors that produce them. “Hunger becoming
public is the start of a struggle, but it’s only the beginning of what’s
required for change,” says Laurie B. Green, an associate professor of
history at the University of Texas at Austin, whose research looks at
the moment in the 1960s when public health commissions, politicians and
the media “discovered” hunger.

The severing of hunger from its socioeconomic context minimized the
relationship between the restructuring of land, labor and industrial
farming and its effect on diets and access to healthful food. Federal
surplus-commodity programs grew out of the Great Depression, providing
hungry people with leftover staples like flour, rice and lard. But their
priority was to subsidize white farmers; the starchy diet did little to
alleviate malnutrition. In the early 1960s, some areas began to offer
food stamps instead. But because the coupons needed to be purchased
every month, and values were set by local counties, they were
inaccessible to the poorest — especially Southern Black residents — who
were now unable to get any food at all. Activists like Fannie Lou Hamer
organized against the program. The purchase requirement remained in
place until 1977.

The first food bank opened in 1967. That December, Look magazine
published photographs by Al Clayton, part of an exposé about a destitute
family living in a windowless shack on no more than “coffee, flour and
an inch of rice in a cellophane bag.” The next year, a CBS documentary,
“Hunger in America,” featured a baby in an American hospital crib
dying of starvation onscreen. Public pressure led to legislation that
improved access to food stamps and created the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in 1972.

But those programs weren’t designed to eliminate need. WIC limits the
age of child recipients; SNAP meets roughly two-thirds of a household’s
food needs, and recipients run out of food by the end of the month. “Our
whole safety net is based on the premise that all able-bodied adults can
get a job, and every kind of assistance is temporary,” says the
Princeton sociologist Kathryn
Edin.

        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

In the 1980s, in response to cuts to food benefits during the Reagan
administration, hunger was discovered again with commissions and
reports. The underlying problem was bound up with the increasingly
punishing nature of the American economy, especially for people of
color. Food banks were supposed to fill in the gaps. But today more than
37 million Americans are food insecure, according to the U.S.D.A. “We
call it an emergency food system, but it’s a 50-year emergency,” says
Noreen Springstead, executive director of WhyHunger, which supports
grass-roots organizations that approach food insecurity systemically.

**Food insecurity no longer** looks like a skinny mother in a tent or
children with rickets and kwashiorkor; it looks like fast food at the
end of the month when SNAP runs out, or rural “food deserts,” where few
food banks reach. Its legacy is diabetes, high blood pressure and
obesity.

The pandemic has revealed the fragility of a highly centralized
industrial food system and has given us a glimpse of the tenuous lives
of the workers who farm, process, deliver and ring up the food we need.
It also has shown, as Springstead points out, just “how close people are
to the edge of the abyss. They can’t keep their apartment and can’t pay
for their groceries; they are one paycheck away from, ‘What am I going
to
do?’”

Programs created to help the poorest Americans now supplement the
working poor. More than half of all SNAP recipients work. The pandemic
has heightened food insecurity. The Salvation Army reported an 84
percent increase since last year in the number of boxes handed out at
their drive-through pantries. Meals on Wheels has seen a 47 percent
increase in the number of people it serves. In addition to federal
subsidies, food banks rely on private donations, which historically
decline during economic downturns. Corporate donors are selling more of
the food they would ordinarily donate because it’s no longer expiring on
the shelves.

Even before the pandemic, food insecurity was entangled with
unaffordable housing, health care costs, unreliable transportation. In
Troy, before she traveled across the country, Kenneally met with her
friend Barbara Broomall. Three days before the eviction moratorium,
federal marshals put Broomall, her three children and their belongings
on the street. With the pandemic lockdown, it became clear that her only
option was a room in the Schuyler Inn, a homeless shelter that was once
a hotel. Broomall and her son both received S.S.I. for mental health
issues, and the $1,457 rent ate up the checks. She had no car to reach
her children’s schools to collect the food they were distributing,
though before the school kitchens were up and running, they were
offering only snacks — Ritz crackers, chips, granola bars — so it wasn’t
worth bus fare. The Schuyler Inn didn’t provide Wi-Fi, so her daughter
tried to connect to her schoolwork in a Burger King parking
lot.

If they go on for too long, temporary solutions become permanent. Food
banks become bureaucracies; hotels meant to hold the overflow of
shelters, like the Schuyler Inn, become homes. Public schools, which
have never reconciled their hours with the actual schedules of working
people, become essential hubs for entire communities.

On July 16, toward the end of her travels, Kenneally pulled up to the
fields of Hatch, N.M. Teodula Portillo, 47, had been up since 4 a.m. She
had allowed her teenage sons 20 more minutes to sleep and didn’t wake
her 11-year-old twin daughters because they cannot work legally until
they are 12. By 5:30 a.m., Portillo and her boys were bent over picking
onions, for which they are paid by the bushel. Employers are required to
pay minimum wage only for certain tasks that are part of agricultural
work. Portillo receives SNAP intermittently — if she earns too much,
they are not eligible. Kenneally knelt on the dirt and began shooting,
some 900 miles from Nipomo, where Lange took her iconic photograph,
which helped Americans discover the hunger that both she and Kenneally
knew too much about. The attachment to this discovering is as persistent
as the underlying social problems — which to this day remain
ignored.
