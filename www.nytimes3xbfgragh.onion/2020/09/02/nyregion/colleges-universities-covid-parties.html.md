# ‘Nobody Likes Snitching’: How Rules Against Parties Are Dividing Campuses

As colleges reopen despite the pandemic, students must decide whether
they are willing to blow the whistle on their classmates.

It looked to be a typical college party: a small group of students
crammed in a kitchenette, cheering on as a shirtless guy arm-wrestled a
laughing young woman. No one wore masks.

The scene was posted on Snapchat by one of the partygoers, a first-year
student at Cornell University, along with a selfie with a mocking
caption: “The people who slide up saying ‘you’re not social distancing’
are the ones that wouldn’t have been invited anyway.”

The response was swift and severe. Within days, an online petition was
created demanding that the student’s admission to Cornell be revoked,
and in the week since, the petition has collected more than 3,500
signatures.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Cornell University is attempting to take the biggest feat of allowing
all students back on campus. This cannot be done without immense safety
precautions taken and the compliance of every student,” a group calling
itself the Concerned Student Coalition [wrote in the
petition](https://www.change.org/p/cornell-university-de-densify-cornell-s-ithaca-campus-by-rescinding-jessica-zhang-24-acceptance).
“We need to hold these students accountable for their actions.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The situation at Cornell underscores a deeper tension on campuses all
over the country as [about 1,100 colleges
embark](https://www.chronicle.com/article/heres-a-list-of-colleges-plans-for-reopening-in-the-fall/?cid2=gen_login_refresh&cid=gen_sign_in)
on the huge experiment of reopening in a pandemic. Students, returning
to school after months of isolation, are not only being asked to fully
reimagine what their college social lives look like, but also to assume
active roles as the front line against an outbreak at their schools by
policing campus safety.

“Nobody likes snitching — it’s not comfortable,” said Melissa Montejo, a
sophomore at Cornell who signed the petition. “I really am not one to go
around and tell people what to do, but for me, this was troubling. Three
months of being careful and not engaging in problematic behavior is
worth saving a life.”

Jessica Zhang, the student who posted the party scene to Snapchat, said
she had apologized and met with Cornell officials. Neither Ms. Zhang nor
Cornell would say whether she was disciplined.

In recent weeks, the coronavirus outbreak has spread swiftly on college
campuses. The New York Times has [tracked thousands of
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html)
that were linked to returning students. Several schools, including the
[University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/unc-chapel-hill-covid.html),
[Notre
Dame](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/notre-dame-coronavirus.html)
and the [State University of New York College at
Oneonta](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/state-shuts-down-suny-oneonta-for-2-weeks-after-105-test-positive-for-virus/2593007/),
suspended in-person classes after more than 100 students at each campus
tested positive, often following large parties.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As a result, growing numbers of college officials are realizing that
there are limits to what they can monitor on their own — and are calling
on students to help.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_1_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Colgate University sent students a memo encouraging them to report
classmates who violate social-distancing guidelines and to include names
so action could be taken. Similar instructions were sent out at schools
across the country from the University of Colorado Boulder to the
University of Pennsylvania. Yale University and some other colleges have
[hotlines in
place](https://your.yale.edu/work-yale/financial-management/university-auditing-quality-assurance/yale-university-hotline/hotline)
for reports of risky activity.

It’s an extraordinary situation, and students face a quandary: Report
parties to campus officials? Or keep quiet and hope for the best? As one
freshman said at Hunter College, which has a dorm open even though
classes are remote this semester: “I don’t know if I’d want to narc on
people I’m trying to become friends with.”

For those in the middle of it, the choice is not as simple as they might
have expected.

“Before coming here, I remember thinking ‘Yeah, I’ll definitely report
people if they’re going to parties,’” said Kyle Duran, a freshman at
Binghamton University in upstate New York. But after spending just a few
days on campus, Mr. Duran had second thoughts. “It’s a lot harder to
want to when you’re living and going to class with everyone.”

Some faculty members at schools have [warned against asking students to
police their
peers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/opinion/coronavirus-college-reopening.html).
They have said doing so could disrupt student life when classmates are
pitted against one other, particularly when the consequences for
breaking the rules can be harsh.

SUNY Plattsburgh, for example, placed [43 students on interim suspension
last
week](https://www.plattsburgh.edu/news/news-archive/president-suspends-students-for-reported-covid-violations.html)
after a large outdoor gathering. [Fifteen others at Marist
College](https://www.maristcircle.com/home/2020/8/22/fifteen-students-suspended-following-off-campus-party-wednesday),
a small liberal arts school in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., were recently sent
home for not following rules at an off-campus party, while at Ohio State
University, [more than 200 have been
suspended](https://www.thelantern.com/2020/08/more-than-200-students-on-interim-suspension-after-weekend-parties/)
for similar reasons.

Ariana Rebello, a freshman at Hofstra University on Long Island, said
hearing about those punishments at other schools has dissuaded her from
attending parties, but also from reporting her classmates. “I don’t
think I could bring myself to snitch. I just wouldn’t associate with
them,” she said.

In states with high virus counts, many administrators said they worried
that college parties could accelerate an all-but-inevitable [rise of
clusters on their
campuses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).
But in the New York metropolitan area, which has largely continued to
stem its own outbreak, the concerns carry a different weight.

Some epidemiologists said they feared that college parties and large
social gatherings could lead to a resurgence of the virus in places like
the New York region that have kept case counts low.

“The biggest concern is that you are going to have newly infected people
leave these parties and disperse back into their communities,” said Dr.
Stephen Thomas, an infectious disease specialist at SUNY Upstate Medical
University. “It’s that they’re going to be sources for continuing to
spread the virus and it’s going to reverse the work that has already
been done.”

Many students say they have more self-interested reasons to report their
peers. On TikTok and other social media platforms, videos have gone
viral in which students say “snitching” on their classmates would be an
easy choice because of how much it costs to attend their colleges.

But for others like Cambria Kelley, a first-year graduate student at New
York University, the issue is more personal. Ms. Kelley, who is from
California, said several members of her family contracted the illness
over the last few months, including her grandmother who died in July.

N.Y.U. has asked students to [“politely urge” their
classmates](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/safety-and-health/coronavirus-testing/student-coronavirus-testing.html)
to wear masks and socially distance and to report those who violate that
advice to school officials. And despite the friendships she may form
with her classmates, Ms. Kelley said she will still feel an obligation
to do so, keeping her family in mind.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If it was bad enough, I wouldn’t hesitate to report them,” Ms. Kelley
said. “I’m not going to be having my life put at risk because people
decided to be selfish. These rules are for the good of everyone here.”

Some students, however, said deciding whether to report classmates
involves a different
calculation.

### School Reopenings ›

#### Back to School

Updated Sept. 8, 2020

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.

  -   - The first day of school is an annual rite of passage. But this
        year, it looks very different for tens of millions of students.
        [We talked to some about their hopes and
        fears](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/us/virtual-return-to-school-covid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).

        leading to concern that young people who are infected will
        contribute to a spread of the virus.
      - A growing number of Catholic schools across the country are
        [shutting down forever during the coronavirus
        pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/us/catholic-school-closings.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup),
        citing insurmountable financial pressure.
      - The magazine’s Ethicist columnist answers a question from a

As a national conversation erupted on the role of police in cities
following the killing of George Floyd, groups at schools including
Vassar College, Stony Brook University and Columbia University called on
their institutions to [rethink their relationships with campus and local
police](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/06/05/students-demand-universities-break-ties-local-police-few-have).

Now they are wrestling with the prospect of relying on those departments
to disperse and crack down on large
gatherings.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Maggie Peng, a senior at Syracuse University, said she plans to approach
friends one-on-one to have conversations about the risks of partying.
She even wrote a lengthy message in a Facebook group for first-year
students urging them to take social distancing more seriously after a
[large outdoor gathering that drew
hundreds](http://dailyorange.com/2020/08/videos-surface-showing-100-syracuse-university-students-gathering-on-campus-not-social-distancing/).

But Ms. Peng said shifting the responsibility for keeping one another
safe from individual students to campus police was troubling. She and
other students at the school said that since large social events
occurred two weeks ago, they have noticed more officers than usual
monitoring residential spaces and common areas.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Peng said the role of campus security in enforcing rules would
dissuade her from reporting her classmates.

“It just doesn’t make sense to rely on campus police for enforcing these
rules,” Ms. Peng said. “Especially when there has been so much tension,
it’s hard to want them involved. Anything bad that happens will usually
involve students of color.”

As the first weeks back on campuses shift into the more regular pace of
the fall, the question remains: Just how long will
students,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>many of whom arrived
in New York State to a [mandatory two-week
quarantine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/nyregion/college-reopening-quarantine-coronavirus.html),
continue to follow their schools’ physical-distancing guidelines?

Some officials at large universities in particular worry parties,
especially those off campus, could slip by undetected.

For now, the students who are caught attending them face harsh
punishments as a warning to others.

Ms. Zhang, the first-year student at Cornell who posted videos of a
party to Snapchat, said in a recent interview that she deeply regrets
both the “lapse in judgment” she made by attending the gathering and her
“insensitive comments” afterward.

“Incoming freshmen come in with heavy expectations, we all want to find
our people,” Ms. Zhang said. “I’m not proud of those posts, they show me
at my worst.”

Since her posts spread on social media, Ms. Zhang said she has received
hundreds of threats, with much of the heaviest criticism coming from
classmates.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As classes at Cornell begin this week, there may soon be an additional
layer to complicated tensions students face when reporting one another:
Ms. Zhang could end up sitting in the same row of her first college
lectures as those who called for her expulsion.
