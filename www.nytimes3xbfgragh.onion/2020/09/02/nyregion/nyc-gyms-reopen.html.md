Most New Yorkers have lived without communal workouts since mid-March,
when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo closed gyms in the state to prevent the spread
of the coronavirus.

Gyms seem an intuitively high-risk environment, and New York waited
months until it allowed the 2,000 or so gyms in the state to reopen.
They were finally [given the go-ahead on
Aug. 24](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/nyregion/nyc-gyms-reopening.html),
along with museums, aquariums and bowling alleys.

The city waited until Wednesday to allow gyms to reopen, so that
officials had more time to conduct inspections, which are taking place
as the city also tries to [reopen
schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/nyregion/schools-open-coronavirus-nyc.html).

Gyms may be a sanctuary of sorts and a healthy outlet for stress when
everyone in the city could use a release, but they remained closed as
retail stores and restaurants reopened — at least for outdoor dining —
and the rate of positive virus tests in the city continued to hover
around 1 percent.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The reopening of gyms signals yet another step toward a return to

But while gyms are coming back, in the city and in most states, the
scene at your local fitness center will be considerably different than
it was before the start of the pandemic. Here is what to expect.

### <span>Free weights are available, but studios are not</span>

Gyms offering weights and exercise machines are allowed to reopen, but
many other exercise facilities in the city have not yet been given the
go-ahead. Indoor pools and places that only offer group fitness classes,
like spinning, Zumba, yoga and Pilates, are not allowed to reopen
because the city sees those activities as higher risk.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One-on-one sessions with personal trainers or yoga teachers are allowed.

“We are certainly going to take a pretty strict stance in the name of
preserving our low level of infection,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on
NY1’s “Inside City Hall” last week, adding, “We want to see jobs come
back, we want to see amenities for people. We also have to make sure
it’s done safely.”

Many fitness studio owners, who have started offering classes outside
and teaching video sessions during the pandemic, believe the strict
regulations that are keeping their businesses closed are unfair.

Amanda Freeman, who owns [a dozen SLT studios](https://sltnyc.com/) in
New York City and 14 outside of it, said that she thinks her low-impact
workout routine is actually less dangerous than workouts at a
conventional gym.

“We’re even more controlled, it’s by appointment only, there are very
limited spots,” Ms. Freeman said. “I don’t understand why we’re worse
than they are.”

Gyms may be open, but don’t expect capacity crowds. [State
regulations](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/Gyms_and_Fitness_Centers_Detailed_Guidelines.pdf)
greatly limit the number of attendees, the distance between machines and
many other factors.

Gyms may only fill up to 33 percent capacity. Gym-goers must wear face
coverings, pass a health screening and maintain at least six feet of
separation at all times. Equipment must be cleaned after each use, and
signage detailing safe practices must be prominently displayed. Gyms
need to install expensive filtration systems, if they do not already
have them.

use](https://info.crunch.com/member-updates) electrostatic disinfectant
sprayers as an additional cleaning method.

These measures may not make for the most sociable workout, but they
should help protect you from infection. State officials said that there
was not a specific metric for whether gyms would need to close again,
but that they would monitor the
situation.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Many experts agree that even with the regulations, fitness centers could
still be risky.

“Gyms can be high risk depending on the setup — from crowding, to close
contact, a lack of masks, adequate ventilation, high-touch surfaces and
a need for disinfection,” said Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at
George Mason University. “The challenge is that people really need to be
spaced out and wearing masks the entire time, and this includes the
locker rooms.”

### <span>Health departments will inspect clubs</span>

State regulations are to be enforced by local health departments, who
are responsible for inspecting gyms within two weeks of their reopening.
People from other agencies, like fire marshals or building inspectors,
can also carry out inspections. Different health departments around the
state work out the specifics of their inspections.

inspections](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/businesses/covid-19-reopening-gyms.pdf)
will be carried out virtually, with inspectors communicating with a gym
owner on a video call to make certain that their precautions are up to
code.

Gyms that do not meet the state requirements — say by not having a
strong enough filtration system, insufficient personal protective
equipment, signage or cleaning supplies — will have to close and will be
fined up to $10,000 if they remain open without complying with state
guidelines.

### <span>The future for fitness in the city is unclear</span>

Reopening is sure to reinvigorate frustrated fitness fans, but the
future for the workout industry in the city remains uncertain.

Reopening a gym can cost more than $20,000, especially with expensive
upgrades to a location’s air filtration system. The added costs come
after months without revenue, when many gym owners find themselves deep
in debt, and will have to reopen to only a third of their normal
customer base.

There is also the risk that people may be fearful of returning to
fitness centers, or may have grown to prefer working out outside, or
forgoing exercise altogether.

“Exercise is habitual, the longer you change a habit the harder it is to
get back,” said Ms. Freeman, the studio owner.

Several gym owners said that they had heard a wide range of responses
from their clients, but that many were enthusiastic to get back to their
gyms.

One gym-goer, Mika Sneddon, said she had worked out a lot less with her
personal trainer, [Lunelle
Belhomme](https://www.lcbfitnessnyc.com/meetlunelle), since gyms closed.
She said she was eager to return to an atmosphere that inspired her to
work out, and that she thought gyms as a whole would find a way to
bounce back.

“Our ability to adapt is much greater than some people think,” Ms.
Sneddon said. “I think it’s just a matter of accepting that maybe things
might look different.”
