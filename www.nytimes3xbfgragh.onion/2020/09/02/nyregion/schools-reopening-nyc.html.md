<div class="css-53u6y8">

Over the past few weeks, teachers and principals have rushed to prepare
for the return of 1.1 million children to public schools across New York
City.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now they have a little more time to do so.

On Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that
in-person<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>classes would start
on Sept. 21 — 10 days later than initially planned. The shift came as
pressure intensified on the mayor to delay the school year, as many
educators said classrooms would not be ready to reopen next week.

Still, New York is on track to be the only major city in the country to
bring students into physical classrooms this fall.

*\[*[*Read more about New York City’s plan for the start of the school
year*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/nyregion/schools-open-coronavirus-nyc.html)*.\]*

Here’s what else you need to know about the mayor’s announcement:

### <span>The details</span>

Under the new plan, teachers will report to schools as scheduled next
week, using the additional time to set up their classrooms and meet with
students individually.

Once the semester starts, most families that have opted for in-person
learning will send their children to school one to three days per week
to allow for social distancing. Starting in October, the city will also
require random monthly coronavirus testing in all schools, with results
that will be ready within 48 hours, the mayor said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. de Blasio has said he will not reopen schools — or will close them —
if the city’s test positivity rate [ticks above 3
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening.html).
For weeks, it has hovered around 1 percent.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_1_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

### <span>The context</span>

Many teachers, raising alarm about ventilation in classrooms and testing
for staff members and students, had asked for the first day of school to
be [moved
back](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/nyregion/schools-reopen-nyc.html).
Some principals also [supported a
delay](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html),
saying that families’ wide-ranging safety concerns about in-person
learning might not be addressed in time.

Mr. de Blasio had insisted that schools would be ready to reopen on
Sept. 10. The pressure to change those plans mounted this week, when the
city’s powerful teachers’ union was poised to authorize an illegal
strike for its 75,000 members.

The delay came as districts across the country were watching New York
City’s reopening effort. Every other big-city mayor has opted to start
the school year fully remote.

Research on [reopenings in other
countries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/world/europe/germany-schools-virus-reopening.html)
with similar virus transmission rates suggests that New York City’s plan
could work if case numbers remain low.

If successful, the effort could help stabilize the city’s sputtering
economy, as many employers believe that school reopenings will play a
big role in whether people return to work.

*\[*[*A parent’s toughest call: In-person schooling or
not?*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/health/coronavirus-parents-schools.html)*\]*

### <span>The reaction</span>

Some parent groups had joined calls for Mr. de Blasio to postpone the
reopening by at least a week, and while Tuesday’s decision provided
that, the news also left many working families little time to rearrange
their schedules.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Still, the tone shifted among some of the loudest critics of the mayor’s
initial plan.

Michael Mulgrew, the leader of the teachers’ union, had previously
suggested that reopening schools without a delay would cause “one of the
biggest debacles in history.” After the mayor’s announcement, he said,
“We now can say that the New York City public schools system has the
most aggressive policies and safeguards of any school system in
America.”

## And finally: A collection of Black music history

The idea began as a [viral slide
show](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBBYMINjC6E/) on Instagram. Its first
image read: “Your favorite music exists because of Black people.”

The post, which recommends articles about pioneering Black artists, has
received more than 150,000 likes, as well as comments from people saying
they would attempt to change how they engage with music.

Jenzia Burgos, the Bronx woman who made the post, said the response made
her realize that she wanted to do more to raise awareness about Black
musicians’ influence on various genres.

She spent the next two months compiling 45 pages of resources about the
history of Black artists’ role in traditional and popular music. Three
weeks ago, she unveiled an online database of that information: the
[Black Music History
Library](https://blackmusiclibrary.com/Library).

### School Reopenings ›

#### Back to School

Updated Sept. 8, 2020

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.

  -   - The first day of school is an annual rite of passage. But this
        year, it looks very different for tens of millions of students.
        [We talked to some about their hopes and
        fears](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/us/virtual-return-to-school-covid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).
      - Coronavirus cases [are spiking in America’s college
        towns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/06/us/colleges-coronavirus-students.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup),
        leading to concern that young people who are infected will
        contribute to a spread of the virus.
      - A growing number of Catholic schools across the country are
        [shutting down forever during the coronavirus
        pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/us/catholic-school-closings.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup),
        citing insurmountable financial pressure.
      - The magazine’s Ethicist columnist answers a question from a
        spokesperson at a major university: [Can I promote a reopening
        plan I have doubts
        about](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/magazine/university-reopening-safety-ethics.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup)?

“When we look at the face of a genre, whether it’s an award show or
whether it’s the thumbnail for a streaming playlist, why is the face of
that not a Black person?” Ms. Burgos, who is a Puerto Rican-Dominican
music journalist, said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The library attempts to address that, directing users to more than 1,000
resources — among them a podcast about the influence of Black artists on
country music, an essay highlighting Black children who play heavy metal
and a documentary exploring the role of Black people within
predominantly white punk scenes.

Including a range of genres was important to her, she added, especially
ones like classical music and rock, which she said were often
“whitewashed” when discussed by listeners.

She also sought to place emphasis on resources by Black authors and
creators, so that “young people who are coming to this site see that
there are Black people writing about this music.”

Ms. Burgos said she hoped to eventually start a library newsletter and
bring others on board to help.

“I hope that folks not only realize how all the music that we listen to
is influenced by the Black community,” Ms. Burgos said, “but I also hope
they start to put their money where their mouth is.”

Dear Diary:

Back when I taught at Brooklyn College, which is at the last stop on the
No. 2 line, the best part of my daily commute from the Upper West Side
was the trip home because I was assured to always get a seat.

One day, arriving at Wall Street, where the train always filled up, I
looked up from my perch to see a woman who was clearly pregnant.

I immediately offered her my seat (my father’s ghost would never have
forgiven me if I hadn’t). Thank yous and you’re welcomes followed.

The next day, same commute, same woman entering at Wall Street, same
routine, same exchange. I figured we were transit buddies now.

“See you tomorrow,” I said.

“Nope,” she answered with a smile. “This is my last day before maternity
leave.”

I sometimes wonder how her child is faring.
