# Do Safari Companies Really Want African Travelers?

During these lean times for tourism, travel companies are appealing to
residents with special rates. But locals ask: Why didn’t you reach out
before?

When the Safari Collection, which owns the Giraffe Manor, a popular
hotel in Nairobi known for its roaming giraffes, posted a photo on its
Instagram account in June with a caption saying that the hotel would be
“welcoming those who can still travel within Nairobi” and Kenyans
could pay a special reduced rate to stay at the hotel, it received
backlash from the very people it hoped to entice.

For many Kenyans, the offer was seen as insulting and only extended
because foreign visitors, the lifeblood of the safari industry, were
largely absent because of restrictions on international travel. Offering
local rates seemed like a desperate ploy from a hotel where locals say
they previously never felt welcome.

“My eyes just rolled when I saw that,” [Harriet
Akinyi](https://www.instagram.com/harrietowalla/), a Nairobi-based
travel writer, said in a phone interview. “It’s hypocritical that it
took a pandemic for them to realize that they have to cater to the
Kenyan market as well, not just the international market.”

[The Safari
Collection](https://www.thesafaricollection.com/properties/giraffe-manor/)
said that the post was published by an independent agent and the wording
was misconstrued. The hotel, the company said, has always been open to
all guests, but this was the first time it ran a special, because it was
the first time it had the empty rooms to do so.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The situation with Covid-19 has resulted in an opportunity to welcome
local guests who wouldn’t normally book in advance — we are usually
booked up months in advance,” said Jessica Pattison, head of sales and
marketing for the Safari Collection, in an email, adding that the
company employs more than 240 people and 95 percent of them are Black.
The company would not reveal its local rates, but for international
visitors, rooms range from $875 per night per person to $3,000 for a
suite sleeping up to four per night, depending on the season and type of
room.

Still, the incident renewed conversations among Kenyans and other
Africans who live in countries that are home to safari companies, tour
operators and luxury lodgings that focus on attracting American and
European visitors. Who, they ask, is really welcome to take part in
these offerings? People in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Botswana
said that the local rates have allowed them to enjoy their own countries
in recent months, but as borders start to reopen, they remain skeptical
about whether they’ll still be invited. Ms. Akinyi shared an email from
[Arijiju](https://www.arijiju.com/), a private-home retreat in Laikipia,
where she was told that the residence had ‘a strict target list of
top-tier international media,’ so she could not visit.

Border closures, national lockdowns and other measures put in place to
stop the spread of the coronavirus have devastated Africa’s [$39 billion
tourism
industry](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Africas-tourism-potential_LandrySigne1.pdf).
The tourism industry funds wildlife conservation across the continent
and the lack of international tourists has led experts to fear that
threatened animals would be poached at higher rates, further endangering
them.

Safari travel as marketed internationally is largely a luxury product,
with beautifully appointed tent camps or lodges appealing to wealthy
travelers. At the high end it can cost thousands of dollars a night,
with guests flown between remote camps on private planes; even at the
more modest end of the spectrum the cost tends to run to hundreds of
dollars a night per person. That puts them far beyond the means of many
Africans: In South Africa, for example, where Kruger National Park is a
major draw for safari vacationers, the average earnings for Black
residents between 2011 and 2015 were 6,899 rand ($413) per month,
according to [a 2019
report](http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/Report-03-10-19/Report-03-10-192017.pdf)
by the country’s Department of Statistics. The same report showed that
for white South Africans, who tend to go on more safari vacations,
average earnings were 24,646 rand ($1,400) per month — more than three
times what Black South Africans make.

Some think it is time to reshape the industry.

“We can’t expect that Covid is the last issue that may cause a pause in
travel, and companies have now seen that solely relying on international
travelers is not sustainable,” said Naledi Khabo, chief executive of
[Africa Tourism Association](https://africatourismassociation.org/), a
U.S.-based agency that promotes tourism to and within Africa. “Having a
consistent base of local travelers will be key to any safari business
who wants to
survive.”

In Tanzania, another country with a fast-growing middle class that is a
popular destination for safaris and luxury stays, local rates have
become the norm. Lodges and safaris are being marketed at half price in
some cases and at even less than that at others.

Andrew Mahiga, a project manager for a development project in Dar es
Salaam, said that when he returned to Tanzania a decade ago, after
living in the United States and Britain, he was committed to [traveling
the country](https://www.instagram.com/drudysseus/?hl=en) and becoming
reacquainted with his home. But he and his fiancée have noticed that at
some hotels and resorts, the services offered to locals can differ
vastly from those offered to international tourists. That hasn’t changed
since the start of the pandemic.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“Even though places are becoming more accessible to us right now, the
experiences are still not equal to those offered to foreigners,” he
said. “When I stay someplace, they aren’t as invested in me as a guest.
They don’t give suggestions for places nearby to see or excursions to go
on and things to try, but foreigners — that’s all provided at length.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Mr. Mahiga, 35, said that recently he and his fiancée have been focusing
on staying at Airbnbs that are owned by Tanzanians and going on tours
that are run by locals.

Although many safari and lodging companies have Black African guides and
staff, the African Travel and Tourism Association estimates that 15
percent of its 600-plus members are [Black
owners](https://www.cntraveller.com/article/locally-owned-safari-camps),
something that locals say plays a part in the feeling that they are not
welcome.

“These luxury resorts and companies that focus on foreigners are finally
being friendly to local Tanzanians and that’s good,” Mr. Mahiga said.
“But since Covid started I’ve found myself wondering, ‘Why don’t I
support really local business, especially when the foreign ones never
wanted my money before?’”

For their part, companies say that locals tend to plan their trips later
than foreign visitors, so that usually when they inquire, they are
already
booked.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may

For Beks Ndlovu, the founder of [African Bush
Camps](https://africanbushcamps.com/), an independently owned safari
company, promoting local rates has always been a key part of operating a
business in any country. Mr. Ndlovu’s company has 15 luxury tented camps
and lodges in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia, and has, for years, offered
advantageous local rates to residents of countries that are part of the
Southern African Development Community, a regional economic community.
For foreign guests, depending on the season, a stay can run between $400
and $950 per person per night, but for locals and people from the region
it is $250 to $380 per person per night.

“This is not something that’s new to us,” he said. “We’ve actively
promoted our offerings and the rate we offer is very favorable to locals
because we understand the earnings in this part of the world are
different from that of the international traveler.”

Mr. Ndlovu, who is Zimbabwean, said that offering local rates isn’t
enough; he believes that his company has been successful among locals in
the countries where it has camps because locals are treated as well as
Europeans and Americans are — something that goes a long way, he said.

Some people, like Lelo Boyana, who works in finance in Johannesburg and
hosts the [travel podcast Chica Travel](https://chicatravel.co.za/),
worry that the push for local guests won’t last past the pandemic. Ms.
Boyana said that although she has taken advantage of local rates
[throughout South
Africa](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-safrica-tourism/with-borders-closed-south-africa-pins-hopes-on-cash-strapped-local-tourists-idUSKBN25R1LI)
this year, she remains skeptical of how much of the money spent by
travelers goes to locals, another common criticism of safari companies.
Travelers, she said, need to ask more questions about where their money
is going and companies need to do more than discount stays.

“I think what’s obvious is that these companies are desperate for
business,” she said. “If they wanted to have us, they would have made
these rates available to us long ago and they would have publicized them
before the pandemic. We are their last resort and their attempts are
halfhearted. They still have a lot of work to do.”

Ms. Khabo of the African Tourism Association said she thought this might
be a turning point. As leisure travel within Africa becomes more
popular, with new flight routes and the easing of visa policies, it
would be bad business for companies to ignore African buying power. She
expects the shift to a focus on domestic travel to continue after the
pandemic.

“There is now a new opportunity to engage the local market and cultivate
local ambassadors, so we will see which companies keep it going,” she
said.

In many cases, the decision to cater to local residents more
aggressively is keeping camps busy. [Asilia
Africa](https://www.asiliaafrica.com/), a company that operates 20 camps
in East Africa, has always had local rates, but this year marks the
first time the company has actively marketed them to residents. In
previous years, people found out about the discounts by word of mouth
and the occasional mention in the local press, Mercedes Bailey, a press
manager at Asilia said.

Staying open and keeping rangers in the bush discouraged poaching, Ms.
Bailey added. Resident sales in June were about 60 percent higher than
during the same period last year. Those sales have also never been
higher than 20 percent, but the company expects them to surpass 50
percent this year.

“We have a social media campaign, targeting Africans,” Ms. Bailey said
in a phone interview. “That’s something we haven’t done before, but
people are coming and we are now asking ourselves: Are people coming now
because they can’t go anywhere else or have they always wanted to come,
but didn’t feel welcome?”
