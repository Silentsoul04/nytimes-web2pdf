Melania Trump used a personal email account and encrypted messaging apps
like Signal to conduct government business, a former friend and
associate of the first lady
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/melania-trump-used-private-email-accounts-while-in-the-white-house-says-former-colleague-and-friend/2020/09/01/3f678ae2-eb3c-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html}{told
The Washington Post}.

Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who served as Mrs. Trump's top aide and had
previously been a close friend, told the newspaper in an interview that
the two women did not use official White House email accounts when they
communicated frequently about official topics.

Ms. Wolkoff recently
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/books/review/melania-and-me-stephanie-winston-wolkoff.html}{published
a memoir}, ``Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the
First Lady,'' but the allegation about Mrs. Trump's use of personal
email accounts is not included in the book.

The use of personal email accounts was at the heart of Donald Trump's
most vicious attacks on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential
campaign. He repeatedly accused her of having deleted 33,000 emails from
a personal server while she was secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton said
the emails were personal in nature, and an F.B.I. investigation found no
evidence that they were deleted deliberately.

Ethics experts said that because Mrs. Trump is not a government
employee, she is not automatically covered by the same laws that would
govern communications by a cabinet secretary or other administration
officials. But discussion of government business and information could
still be violations.
