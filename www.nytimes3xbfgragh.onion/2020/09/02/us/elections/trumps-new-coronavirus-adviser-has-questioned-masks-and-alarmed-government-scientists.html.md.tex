President Trump has recently turned to a new adviser on the coronavirus:
Dr. Scott W. Atlas, who has argued that the science of mask-wearing is
uncertain, that children cannot pass on the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html}{coronavirus}
and that the role of the government is not to stamp out the virus but to
protect its most vulnerable citizens.

Ideas like these, both ideologically freighted and scientifically
disputed, have propelled Dr. Atlas, a radiologist and senior fellow at
Stanford University's conservative \href{https://www.hoover.org/}{Hoover
Institution} into President Trump's White House, where he is pushing to
reshape the administration's response to the pandemic.

Mr. Trump has embraced Dr. Atlas, as has Mark Meadows, the White House
chief of staff, even as he upsets the balance of power within the White
House coronavirus task force with ideas that top government doctors and
scientists like Anthony S. Fauci, Deborah L. Birx and Jerome Adams, the
surgeon general, find misguided --- even dangerous --- according to
people familiar with the task force's deliberations.

Dr. Atlas is neither an epidemiologist nor an infectious disease expert,
the two jobs usually associated with pandemic response. But his frequent
appearances on the Fox News Channel and his ideological surety caught
the president's eye.

The core of his appeal in the West Wing rests in his libertarian-style
approach to disease management, akin to one used to disastrous effect in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/business/sweden-economy-coronavirus.html}{Sweden}.
The argument: Most people infected will not get seriously ill, and at
some point, enough people will have antibodies to deprive the virus of
carriers --- ``herd immunity.'' His embrace of this, and other ideas,
has alienated his colleagues.

``Trying to get to herd immunity other than with a vaccine isn't a
strategy. It's a catastrophe,'' said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former C.D.C.
director.

Dr. Atlas declined a request to be interviewed, but Judd Deere, a White
House spokesman, accused the news media of trying to ``distort and
diminish'' his beliefs and record, adding that the adviser ``is working
to carry out the president's No. 1 priority: protecting the health and
safety of the American people.'' White House officials said there had
never been an attempt to shift policy to anything resembling herd
immunity.
