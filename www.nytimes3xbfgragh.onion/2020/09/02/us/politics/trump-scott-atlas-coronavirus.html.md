<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

WASHINGTON — Dr. Scott W. Atlas has argued that the science of mask
wearing is uncertain, that children cannot pass on the
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/politics/woodward-trump-book-virus.html)
and that the role of the government is not to stamp out the virus but to
protect its most vulnerable citizens as Covid-19 takes its course.

Ideas like these, both ideologically freighted and scientifically
disputed, have propelled the radiologist and senior fellow at Stanford
University’s conservative Hoover Institution into President Trump’s
White House, where he is pushing to reshape the administration’s
response to the pandemic.

Mr. Trump has embraced Dr. Atlas, as has Mark Meadows, the White House
chief of staff, even as he upsets the balance of power within the White
House coronavirus task force with ideas that top government doctors and
scientists like Anthony S. Fauci, Deborah L. Birx and Jerome Adams, the
surgeon general, find misguided — even dangerous — according to people
familiar with the task force’s deliberations.

That might be the point.

“I think Trump clearly does not like the advice he was receiving from
the people who are the experts — Fauci, Birx, etc. — so he has slowly
shifted from their advice to somebody who tells him what he wants to
hear,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory
University who is close to Dr. Birx, the White House coronavirus
response coordinator.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Atlas is neither an epidemiologist nor an infectious disease expert,
the two jobs usually associated with pandemic response. But his frequent
appearances on Fox News Channel and his ideological surety caught the
president’s eye.

So when Mr. Trump resumed his coronavirus news conferences in July and
August, it was Dr. Atlas who helped prepare his briefing materials,
according to people familiar with them. And it was his ideas that
spilled from the president’s mouth.

“He has many great ideas,” Mr. Trump told reporters at a White House
briefing last month with Dr. Atlas seated feet away. “And he thinks what
we’ve done is really good, and now we’ll take it to a new level.”

The core of his appeal in the West Wing rests in his libertarian-style
approach to disease management in which the government focuses on small
populations of at-risk individuals — the elderly, the sick and the
immune-compromised — and minimizes restrictions for the rest of the
population, akin to an approach used to [disastrous effect in
Sweden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/business/sweden-economy-coronavirus.html).
The argument: Most people infected by the coronavirus will not get
seriously ill, and at some point, enough people will have antibodies
from Covid-19 to deprive the virus of carriers — “herd immunity.”

“Once you get to a certain number — we use the word herd — once you get
to a certain number, it’s going to go away,” Mr. Trump told Laura
Ingraham on Fox News on Monday night.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Atlas’s push has led to repeated private confrontations with Dr.
Birx, who in recent weeks has been advocating rigorous rules on wearing
masks, limiting bars and restaurants, and minimizing large public
gatherings.

Dr. Atlas declined a request to be interviewed, but Judd Deere, a White
House spokesman, accused the news media of trying to “distort and
diminish” his beliefs and record, adding that the adviser “is working to
carry out the president’s No. 1 priority: protecting the health and
safety of the American people.” White House officials said there had
never been an attempt to shift policy to anything resembling herd
immunity.

“There’s never been any advocacy of a herd immunity strategy coming from
me to the president, to anyone in the administration, to the task force,
to anyone I’ve spoken to,” Dr. Atlas said in a radio interview Tuesday.

White House officials said administration policy continued to focus on
efforts to curb the spread of the disease while pushing to rapidly
develop medical therapies to minimize deaths, as well as a vaccine. The
president and his aides believe effective treatments are critical to
allowing the country to return to normal.

But health officials say Dr. Atlas’s beliefs, argued in news media
appearances and private conversations, have begun to shift the
administration’s thinking.

Before joining the task force, Dr. Atlas pitched his ideas as a health
commentator on Fox News, which is in part how he attracted Mr. Trump’s
attention. His arrival at the White House has coincided with less
visible roles for Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, the director of the National
Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Atlas pushed for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to

that people without

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

But it is Dr. Atlas’s embrace of herd immunity that has alienated his
colleagues the most.

“When you isolate everyone, including all the healthy people, you’re
prolonging the problem because you’re preventing population immunity,”
Dr. Atlas said in a [Fox News radio
interview](https://radio.foxnews.com/2020/07/09/dr-scott-atlas-there-is-no-risk-to-children-from-covid-19-i-dont-know-why-people-deny-this/)
in July. “Low-risk groups getting the infection is not a problem. In
fact, it’s a positive.”

In a Fox News interview in June, he lamented that “misinformation has
spread” about herd immunity, arguing: “The reality is that when a
population has enough people who have had the infection, and since these
people don’t have a problem with the infection, that’s not a problem.
That’s not a bad thing.”

In Sweden, the government allowed restaurants, gyms, shops, playgrounds
and schools to remain open as the virus spread, [asking its
citizens](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-herd-immunity.html)
to follow social distancing and hygiene guidelines and protect more
vulnerable parts of the population.

The Washington Post on Monday
[reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-scott-atlas-herd-immunity/2020/08/30/925e68fe-e93b-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-banner-low_virustrump-7am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans)
Dr. Atlas’s advocacy for such a model.

That “soft lockdown” in Sweden had calamitous consequences, even in a
country less densely populated and healthier than the United States.
[Thousands more people
died](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/15/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-deaths.html)
than in neighboring countries that imposed strict lockdowns. The
country’s economy also continued to struggle, and Sweden still falls
far short of what scientists view as a possible threshold for herd
immunity.

But the idea has gained traction in conservative circles. Senator Rand
Paul, Republican of Kentucky, [says the United States
needs](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/SenatorRandPaul/posts/swedens-death-rate-was-less-than-a-third-of-new-yorks-an-important-fact-to-con)
to look at Sweden “before letting the nanny-staters shut the economy
down again.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his show [in
April](https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/04/10/two-stories-indicate-coronavirus-herd-immunity/)
and [cheered Dr. Atlas’s
hiring](https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/08/10/good-news-dr-scott-atlas-added-to-coronavirus-task-force/)
at the White House, saying he was “countering Fauci.”

“Scott Atlas is a brilliant guy, and he thinks by early October that we
could well be burned out of Covid,” Mr. Limbaugh said.

Kevin Hassett, a former chairman of Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic
Advisers, who returned briefly to the White House this spring to help
with the response to the pandemic, called Dr. Atlas “a legendary
physician, and one of the smartest guys I know.”

He cited Dr. Atlas’s early warnings for governors to protect nursing
homes from the virus. “He’s very similar to President Trump, in that you
never have to wonder what he thinks,” Mr. Hassett said.

Mr. Trump is clearly enamored with Dr. Atlas’s arguments, which back up
the president’s desire to restart the economy, open schools and move
beyond the daily drumbeat of dire virus news.

But fully embracing any version of a policy resembling herd immunity has
profound medical and political risks. Simply allowing the virus to
travel through most of the population could lead to hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of deaths. And medical officials are still
not sure how long that immunity might last, and how long-lasting some
effects of the virus could be.

“Trying to get to herd immunity other than with a vaccine isn’t a
strategy,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former C.D.C. director. “It’s a
catastrophe.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins
University who has [researched and
written](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html)
about herd immunity, said that “the appeal of the concept of herd
immunity is that it suggests we can simply go about doing our regular
daily lives and the coronavirus pandemic will take care of itself,” but
that it has been tried and has not worked. “Where we have had less
stringent responses, we’ve had more cases and more deaths,” he said.

Dr. Atlas’s medical background — chief of neuroradiology at Stanford
University Medical Center from 1998 to 2012 and editor of the textbook
“Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain and Spine” — appears
incongruous with his current role.

But Dr. Atlas does have political connections in Mr. Trump’s world. He
has [advised the president’s personal
lawyer](https://pnhp.org/news/rudy-giulianis-health-care-proposal/)
Rudolph W. Giuliani, and his Hoover Institution employs several staunch
supporters of Mr. Trump’s handling of the virus.

Some Hoover scholars were early opponents of state and local government
moves to shut down economic activity in March and April, including
[Richard Epstein, a law professor who predicted in
March](https://www.hoover.org/research/coronavirus-pandemic) that only
500 Americans would die of the virus.

Another Hoover scholar, David R. Henderson, [wrote in
May](https://www.hoover.org/research/end-lockdowns-now): “If the
lockdowns are ended immediately, will there be more deaths than if the
they were not ended forthwith? Probably. But that won’t be enough to
declare that ending the lockdown was a failure.”

In Washington, Dr. Atlas has introduced new tension to the coronavirus
task force.

In one of his first meetings, he argued over the science of mask
wearing. As Drs. Fauci and Birx maintained that drops in caseloads
reflected public health measures such as social distancing and
mask-wearing, Dr. Atlas insisted that peaks and declines could have
merely been the virus running its course, senior administration
officials said.

In other discussions, he argued that children cannot spread the virus,
despite numerous studies that have
[shown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/health/coronavirus-children.html)
that children can carry the virus, transmit it and die from it.

In [a June
interview](https://www.hoover.org/research/doctor-scott-atlas-and-efficacy-lockdowns-social-distancing-and-closings-1)
with the Hoover Institution, he called it “literally irrational” to
close schools. “All over the world, Switzerland, Iceland, Australia, the
United Kingdom, Ireland, Asian countries, there is a minimal, if any,
risk of children transmitting the disease, even to their parents,” he
said.

Dr. Atlas brought a similar argument to an August event encouraging
school reopenings with Mr. Trump and Betsy DeVos, the education
secretary.

His role in the White House has given conservative media a new official
to present as a scientific authority on the coronavirus.

“The reality is that there’s certain data that’s very controversial
about masks,” he told Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, in August,
[railing
against](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6180318434001#sp=show-clips) the
“massive amount of fear bordering on hysteria.”

Dr. Atlas has also regularly promoted an idea that [immunologists say is
simply
wrong](https://twitter.com/profshanecrotty/status/1293344524731691008),
that immune cells [called T
cells](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/coronavirus-immune-cells.html),
programmed with infection from other coronaviruses, can function like
antibodies to prevent Covid-19.
