# Once Out, Consort to Thailand’s King Is Back In (and a Major General, Again)

</div>

Demoted a year ago after being accused by the palace of upstaging the
queen, the former consort to King Maha Vajiralongkorn has regained the
titles she was stripped of last year.

BANGKOK — The king of Thailand liked her. Then he didn’t. Now,
apparently, he likes her again.

Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi rose to the position of royal consort to [King
Maha Vajiralongkorn
Bodindradebayavarangkun](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/01/world/asia/thailand-king.html?module=inline),
only to be
[stripped](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/21/world/asia/king-thailand-royal-consort.html?searchResultPosition=1)
of her official title last year, amid accusations from the palace that
she was trying to upstage the queen.

On Wednesday, the Royal Thai Government Gazette announced that Ms.
Sineenat was back in possession of her noble titles. She had not been
seen publicly since her dismissal nearly a year ago, and her whereabouts
had not been officially revealed.

The position of royal consort, referring to a female companion who is
not a wife, had not existed in Thailand since absolute monarchy was
abolished in 1932 until the current king revived it for Ms. Sineenat.

King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been married multiple times. His first wife
was his cousin; his third was purged and members of her family were
jailed for disrespecting the monarchy.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Sineenat, who once worked as a nurse and an employee of a royal
handicraft store, was given the title of royal consort in July 2019, on
the king’s 67th birthday. Her promotion came about two months after the
king married Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, who is his fourth
wife.

Soon after, Ms. Sineenat, who also attained the military rank of major
general, was prominently featured in [dozens of
photographs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/27/world/asia/thailand-consort-king.html)
released online by the Royal Household Bureau. In one image she was seen
perched in an airplane cockpit wearing a camouflage-printed sports bra.
In another, she aimed an assault rifle. In still another, she held the
king’s pet poodle, which was wearing what appeared to be a black leather
onesie. At least one of the king’s dogs has also held a military rank.

When Ms. Sineenat was ousted last October, she was accused by the palace
of “misbehavior and disloyalty against the monarch.” Other palace aides
were later dismissed, including bedchamber pages who were accused of
unspecified “[extremely evil
misconduct](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/06/world/asia/thailand-king-consort-wives.html).”

The announcement of the reinstatement of Ms. Sineenat’s titles on
Wednesday included the resumption of her military rank. According to an
order signed in late August by the king, Ms. Sineenat was deemed “free
of guilt.”

Thailand is bound by strict laws protecting the monarchy from criticism.
Offenders can be imprisoned for up to 15 years.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In recent weeks, however, a peaceful [protest
movement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/world/asia/thailand-protests-democracy-monarchy.html)
against Thailand’s military-dominated government has begun calling for
reforms to the country’s monarchy.

King Maha Vajiralongkorn spends little time in Thailand, preferring to
live in Europe instead. Since his father died in 2016, he has assumed
direct control over royal coffers and over army units that have
historically carried out coups against democratically elected
governments.

Thailand has experienced a dozen successful coups; one major rationale
for the last one, in 2014, was to safeguard the monarchy. The leader of
that putsch, Prayuth Chan-ocha, is still prime minister.

While the news that Ms. Sineenat lost her multiple titles made headlines
in Thailand last year, her reinstatement was barely noted on state
television on Wednesday.

The palace statement released earlier in the day noted that “henceforth,
it shall be like she was never stripped of her military ranks or royal
decorations.”
