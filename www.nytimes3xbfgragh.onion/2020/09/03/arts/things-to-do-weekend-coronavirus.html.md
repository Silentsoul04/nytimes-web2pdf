[In the recently released
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L17urNKitwk) “A Marvelous Night
at the Apollo,” members of the team behind the Season 3 finale of [“The
Marvelous Mrs.
Maisel”](https://www.amazon.com/Marvelous-Mrs-Maisel-Season/dp/B06VYH1GF7)
discuss the making of the episode, “A Jewish Girl Walks Into the Apollo
…” The show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, describes it as a love
letter to [the Apollo Theater](https://www.apollotheater.org/) and
reveals a personal connection: Her father, the comedian Don Sherman,
opened for Dinah Washington at the storied Harlem institution.
Washington advised Sherman to drop his act and just joke with the crowd
about working with her.

“It was an interesting story that always stuck with me, because I
thought, ‘Well, geez, that’s sort of the power of stand-up,’”
Sherman-Palladino says.

The “Apollo” episode is nominated for four Emmy Awards, including a
guest actress nod for [Wanda Sykes](https://www.wandasykes.com/), who
portrayed the comedy legend Moms Mabley. A fan of Mabley, Sykes recalls
in the video her own debut at the Apollo. “I remember not even hearing
myself do the jokes because it was, like, I’m looking at the audience,
but I kept my eye on Sandman. ‘Where’s Sandman?’” Sykes says, referring
to Howard Sims, who steered performers who displeased the crowd
offstage.

Catch “A Marvelous Night at the Apollo” on Apollo’s [Digital
Stage](https://www.apollotheater.org/digitalstage/) before its fall
season starts with a performance by Wyclef Jean on Wednesday.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It’s no secret that for all but a rarefied few musicians, record sales
alone can no longer pay the bills. Back in March, when tour
cancellations wiped out many performers’ livelihoods overnight, Bandcamp
took action. This week, the music platform will continue its new custom
of waiving its revenue share on purchases made the first Friday of every
month, so fans can put more money directly into artists’ pockets.

Have a few dollars to spend this [Bandcamp
Friday](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/update-on-bandcamp-fridays)
but unsure what to spring for? Among this week’s new releases are
several worthy candidates.
[“Hannah,”](https://lomelda.bandcamp.com/album/hannah) the third
full-length album by the Texan singer-songwriter Lomelda, continues her
project of condensing sprawling musical ideas into bite-size bits. On
one standout track, she name-drops herself alongside Frank Ocean and
Frankie Cosmos, two artists with whom she shares a knack for poignant
introspection.

Consider, also, a second Hannah: Hannah Georgas, whose new album, [“All
That
Emotion,”](https://hannahgeorgas.bandcamp.com/album/all-that-emotion)
was produced by Aaron Dessner. Like his recent [collaboration with
Taylor
Swift](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review.html),
“All That Emotion” boasts sweeping orchestration and cozy melodies. For
those seeking something with a bit more edge, [“Hanging
Garden,”](https://coreyflood.bandcamp.com/album/hanging-garden) the
debut LP from the punky Philadelphia trio Corey Flood, should satisfy.
Its energetic guitar work makes it somewhat peppier than the group’s
first EP, “Wish You Hadn’t.”

What good is it Zooming alone in your room?

Remember nightclubs? Remember tiny tables, low lights, spilled cocktails
and the promise that [Bridget Everett](http://www.bridgeteverett.net/)
might fall into your lap? Cabaret collapsed when theaters and
restaurants shut down, as did the alternative cabaret scene, its
rounder-heeled, wilder, boozier cousin. Unless someone suddenly
discovers that chardonnay has anti-Covid properties, it may be a while
until we can again watch Cole Escola play Everett’s fetus or [Molly
Pope](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/02/15/theater/for-molly-pope-adventures-in-cabaret-and-horseplay.html)
act out artificially inseminating herself to Kesha’s “Your Love Is My
Drug.”

But screens provide some comfort. The Stage streaming platform, an
eclectic mix of movies, original series and performance documentation,
has [“Kiki & Herb: Live at the Knitting
Factory.”](https://www.watchstage.com/programs/kiki-herb-live-at-the-knitting-factory)
A double act courtesy of Justin Vivian Bond and Kenny Mellman, [Kiki and
Herb](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/17/arts/music/kiki-and-herb-kitsch-with-a-whisky-chaser.html)
began as fright drag comedy and then evolved almost immediately into
something weirder, lovelier and defiantly moving. In this video, which
celebrates, as Kiki says, “The Year of Magical Drinking,” the duo, in
trashy old-age makeup, play originals and covers — “Boulder to
Birmingham,” “The Rhythm Divine.”

Elsewhere, Murray Hill offers laughs[via
Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEIoksMFDbc/), [Club
Cumming](https://clubcummingnyc.com/) presents the occasional variety
show through its website, and on days when the world doesn’t have your
back, you can enter “Bridget Everett” and “videos” into a search engine
and bounce your troubles away.

For fans of obscure operas — and lesser-heard symphonies and chamber
pieces — the Bard Music Festival is one of the best reasons to stick
close to New York in late summer. That’s because the conductor and Bard
College president Leon Botstein’s annual event is your best shot to
[catch rare works by Erich Wolfgang
Korngold](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/29/arts/music/korngold-bard-music-festival.html)
or Franz Schreker (in North America, anyway). The atypical offerings
represent an intervention in American classical programming.

</div>

</div>

Bard continues this advocacy despite the pandemic: For four weekends in
September, it will be streaming live concerts (sans audiences) through
its [website](https://fishercenter.bard.edu/bmf/). And you have to plan
to attend on time, too, since festival organizers currently have no
plans to archive these gigs. They’ll be free to see in the moment,
however. (All you need to do is register online ahead of time.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

First up, on Saturday at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time, is a program featuring
music by Mendelssohn and George Walker, as well as two pieces by William
Grant Still, often called the “dean” of Black composers. Botstein and
James Bagwell will conduct the players in the Orchestra Now, Bard’s
pre-professional ensemble that last year [delivered stirring
performances of Webern and Morton
Feldman](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/25/arts/music/classical-music-youtube.html)
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On the orchestra’s YouTube channel,
you can hear its take on Still’s “Afro-American Symphony” [from a 2018
concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S-g-qYnqQQ).

Nine weeks after 15 teenagers enrolled in the Studio Museum in Harlem’s
eight-month program [Expanding the Walls: Making Connections Between
Photography, History, and
Community](https://studiomuseum.org/expanding-walls-2020), lockdown
began, and the walls (at least figuratively) contracted. The 10
adolescents in the [Project: Identity
Photography](https://www.bethelwoodscenter.org/programs/teens) 12-week
intensive course at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts in Bethel,
N.Y., faced a similar challenge: They had met only briefly when
quarantine started.

These free annual programs equip accepted students with digital cameras
and offer them training, mentorship and a final group exhibition of
their work. Despite the pandemic, the institutions fulfilled their
commitments.

The Studio Museum’s virtual show, [“Hearts in Isolation: Expanding the
Walls 2020,”](https://www.expandingthewalls.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/hearts-in-isolation)
which is online through July 2021, features 30 images: desolate streets
and shadowy interiors; still lifes of objects, food and clothes; intense
portraits of urban solitude. On Sept. 23, the museum will begin Teen

interviews with some of the participants.

The 49 photographs in Bethel Woods’s [“Captured at a
Distance”](https://www.bethelwoodscenter.org/project-identity-photography-virtual-gallery)
virtual gallery depict a more rural seclusion, with sunsets, forests and
flowers. Online through December, the show also has [starker

In a normal year, the [Detroit Jazz
Festival](https://www.detroitjazzfest.org/) would be the world’s largest
unticketed jazz event, drawing hundreds of thousands to a free four-day
celebration across four stages in downtown Motor City. The performers
would range from international stars to local stalwarts for whom this
represents the grandest stage there is.

This year, unable to convene a crowd, organizers are presenting a
livestreamed version of the festival while still leaning in to its
typical blend of local identity and large scale. From Friday through
Monday, the festival will offer concerts on three separate indoor stages
at the Detroit Marriott. They’ll be shot by a professional crew,
broadcast on local TV and radio stations and streamed all weekend on the
festival’s

Over the past six months, as so much performance has migrated online,
it’s been hard at times to keep up with the sheer volume of digital
dance from around the world. A short break is not a bad thing. Labor Day
weekend brings a lull in new virtual dance offerings and a moment to
explore what’s already out there.

While some institutions have commissioned new works for the screen,
others have reached into their archives to release rarely seen
recordings of past events. One rich collection is on the Brooklyn
Academy of Music’s website: [Love From the BAM Hamm
Archives](http://levyarchive.bam.org/Front/Index/featured_set_id/3304),
which currently includes more than two dozen talks and performances from
the past 12 years.

Two videos in the multigenre collection will be of particular interest
to dance lovers: John Jasperse’s enigmatic
[“Remains,”](http://levyarchive.bam.org/Detail/objects/84168)
presented at the 2016 Next Wave Festival; and the luminous 2011 edition
of DanceAfrica (an annual spring celebration), titled [“Expressions and
Encounters: African, Cuban, and American
Rhythms,”](http://levyarchive.bam.org/Detail/objects/92549) with
appearances by multiple dance and drum ensembles. Click on the credits
for each video, and you’ll find troves of related archival materials:
posters, photographs, program notes, audio recordings, more performance
footage. It’s easy to get lost here, in the best way, and end up far
from where you started.
