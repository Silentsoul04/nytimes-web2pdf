<div class="css-53u6y8">

More than five months after the coronavirus pandemic began throttling
the economy, layoffs remain widespread, the [government
reported](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OPA/newsreleases/ui-claims/20201671.pdf)
Thursday, the latest sign of the labor market’s painstakingly slow
recovery.

Last week, **** 833,000 workers filed new claims for state unemployment
benefits, while 759,000 new claims were filed by freelancers, part-time
workers and others under a federal program called Pandemic Unemployment
Assistance. Both figures, which are not seasonally adjusted, were
increases from the previous week.

“It’s pretty bad at this stage in the crisis,” said Gregory Daco, chief
U.S. economist at the forecasting firm Oxford Economics. “I feel like
this is a very fragile labor market at a critical juncture.”

There has been [progress](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICNSA) from
the early days of the pandemic, when weekly tallies of new claims surged
past six million. But recent improvements have been more arduous.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April, more than nine million
have been regained. And most analysts expect that the monthly [jobs
report](https://www.bls.gov/), scheduled for release on Friday, will
show a dip in August from double-digit unemployment rates.

But the damage to the economy has been wide and deep. As of mid-August,
more than 29 million Americans were receiving some sort of unemployment
insurance.

The report on Thursday was the first to be affected by a change in [the
way the Labor Department
accounts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#the-labor-department-will-start-counting-unemployment-claims-in-a-new-way)
for predictable seasonal patterns, like temporary holiday workers who
are laid off in January.

The seasonally adjusted figure for the week was 881,000. The number
looks much lower than the previous week’s adjusted figure of just over
one million, but the drop can be attributed to the altered methodology.
Because the change means seasonally adjusted numbers cannot be compared
with those tallied until now, The Times is emphasizing the unadjusted
figures.

The unadjusted number of 833,000 last week was an increase from 826,000
the week before.

Mr. Daco said he was particularly concerned about the increase last week
in new claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the program for
those generally ineligible for state jobless benefits. The total of
759,000 was up from 608,000 a week earlier.

“It could reflect a weakening economy in some of the states worst
impacted by the health crisis,” he said, “or it could be that some of
the workers that had returned are finding that it’s not possible or
sustainable to return to their primary economic activity in the current
environment.”

Some businesses are hiring. Postings at the job search site Indeed rose
slightly last week, although the total is still more than 20 percent
below what it was this time last year.

The hospitality, tourism, and sports and fitness sectors are in the
worst shape, with postings down more than 40 percent from where they
were a year ago. Listings for higher wage jobs in banking, finance and
software development are also much more scarce.

Construction, driving and warehouse jobs seem to be the most plentiful.

The job site ZipRecruiter has seen a gradual increase in job listings
over the past couple of months, but the pace of growth began to slow in
mid-August, said Julia Pollak, the company’s economist.

Consumers pulled back on spending after a $600 weekly jobless benefit
supplement ceased in July. At the same time, many [small businesses are
running out of the
money](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/business/economy/small-businesses-coronavirus.html)
they received through the federal Paycheck Protection Program.

A recent
[survey](https://www.nfib.com/content/press-release/economy/one-in-five-small-businesses-say-they-will-have-to-close-their-doors-if-economic-conditions-dont-improve-in-next-six-months/)

## Congressional negotiations on a new relief package remain at a standstill.

The Labor Department report provided no fundamental change in the jobs
picture that would resolve the stalemate between Republicans and
Democrats in Congress over a new economic relief package.

With the end of the [$600-a-week
jobless](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
benefit supplement, most states are moving ahead with plans to provide
unemployed workers with a temporary replacement: a weekly[$300
supplement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/stimulus-unemployment-payment-benefit.html)
paid out of federal disaster relief funds.

As of Wednesday, 45 states had [applied for a
grant](https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/lost-wages-assistance-approved-states)
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Six of those — Arizona,
Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee and Texas — have started paying
out benefits, according to the Labor Department, but a vast majority
have not.

Most will probably not be able to gear up to start payments until
mid-September or later. The supplement is expected to last four or five
weeks.

South Dakota is the only state that has confirmed it is not taking part.
[Gov. Kristi
Noem](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/us/elections/south-dakota-governor-turns-down-extra-unemployment-funding-saying-the-state-doesnt-need-it.html)
says her state doesn’t need the money.

A handful of states, including Kentucky, Montana and West Virginia, have
plans to boost the supplement with an additional $100.

Economists say the extra jobless benefit is crucial to the economy’s
recovery. “The data are showing us that the expiration of the
supplemental benefits is having a clear impact on consumption,” said
Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. “As a result the
momentum of the economic recovery seems to be slowing as we move to the
end of the third quarter.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The big question, Mr. Tannenbaum said, is whether Congress can respond
effectively. “Are we going to build a bridge of sufficient length to get
to the post-Covid environment without permanent economic damage?” he
asked.

Karen Kent hopes that this will be the last week she will have to file a
jobless claim. A cafeteria worker at a local high school in Pennington,
N.J., Ms. Kent, 47, was laid off in early March as schools began closing
in response to the coronavirus crisis.

Last week, she got a call telling her she was the one cafeteria worker
from her school going back to work. Her first shift is supposed to start
Wednesday.

Her husband, who works for a fire protection service company, was able
to hold on to his job, but because he works on commission, his income
has been unpredictable.

“The $600 is the only reason we stayed afloat,” Ms. Kent said of the
weekly federal supplement, which lapsed at the end of July. Without it,
her state benefits came to $157. “We’re at the stage where we’re pretty
lean.”

She and her husband live in affordable housing, and they have twice
deferred their monthly mortgage payment of $537 and condo association
fee of $234. Then there’s the $185 they owe to Verizon and $457 in
unpaid medical insurance bills.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Kent was glad she was called back to her $11.40-an-hour job. But she
has asthma and a heart condition and is concerned about her exposure to
the virus while working at a school.

“I’m terrified because I don’t know if I’m going to have enough
protection,” she said. “But you have to do what you have to do to pay
the bills.”

Others are still waiting for the chance to return to
work.

Whitney Anne Adams, 34, a freelance costume designer for film in
Astoria, Queens, has been out of work since mid-March.

It took seven weeks for unemployment benefits to start arriving. And
without the $600 jobless benefit supplement, she has been relying on her
credit card since August. She said she now owed $15,000.

Ms. Adams, who has two rare blood disorders, had to go into debt before,
for medical expenses. It took multiple jobs over more than a decade,
sometimes working 100 hours a week, to pay off the $25,000 she owed.
Finally, in February, she was debt-free for the first time in 12 years.

One month later, the pandemic hit, and she was back where she started.

“I’m most worried about going back to that pit of debt again,” she said.
