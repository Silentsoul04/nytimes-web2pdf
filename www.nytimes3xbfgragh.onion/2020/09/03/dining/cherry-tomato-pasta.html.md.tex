Separated from perfection by nothing more than a pinch of salt, ripe
tomatoes inspire a very particular type of summer joy. In the last few
weeks of the season, many of us consume them ravenously, as if storing
sunshine for the cold months ahead.

You'll still find plenty at their peak right now, but even when the best
of the summer tomatoes are gone, cherry tomatoes can be counted on
year-round to provide more texture than canned tomatoes and more taste
than larger varieties.

``The big thing about cherries is that they pack more flavor than their
larger brethren,'' said Dr. Harry J. Klee, who studies tomato fruit
development at the University of Florida. ``Think of a larger tomato as
the same amount of flavor with a lot more water.''

This
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020690-spicy-and-saucy-cherry-tomato-pasta}{spicy
and saucy tomato pasta} leans upon that diminutive fruit for an easy
weeknight meal that delivers bright flavor with minimal effort. The
sauce starts with just two fresh ingredients --- cherry tomatoes and
basil --- and is finished with tomato paste and salty capers for a
robust punch.

Tomato paste fortifies the fruit's flavor, the same way a combination of
fresh lemon juice and zest might intensify the flavors of a citrus
dessert. The technique here is simple: While your pasta water boils,
heat some olive oil, squeeze in some tomato paste, and cook until it
darkens from brick red to a plummy shade of red wine. This effectively
caramelizes the paste, exaggerating the tomato's natural sweetness.

Sweat some garlic and red-pepper flakes --- or Aleppo pepper, chiles de
árbol, gochujang or any other spicy condiment you have on hand --- then
simmer with cherry tomatoes and a splash of pasta water, and your pasta
sauce is ready in 20 minutes.

Toss in your cooked pasta --- orecchiette will cup everything nicely,
but any shaped pasta will suffice --- and some torn basil, top with
crispy fried capers and a dollop of ricotta, and you've got a quick
pasta dish that will taste like summer no matter what season it is.
