This month we’re going to try something a little different.

Ordinarily, I suggest three bottles of the same type of wine. Instead, I
want to compare three wines that are closely related but come from
different appellations within a larger region, the Northern Rhône Valley
of France.

Each is made with the syrah grape. But what if anything distinguishes
one from the others? That’s what we are going to examine.

The French appellation system suggests that each place will have its own
distinctive characteristics. It’s one thing, say, to compare a
Chambolle-Musigny from Burgundy with a Chinon from the Loire Valley. One
is made from pinot noir, the other with cabernet franc. You would expect
that they would differ for that reason alone.

But if wines are made with the same grape, other factors come into play.
In the case of the Northern Rhône, the French authorities concluded long
ago that the wines made in St.-Joseph, Crozes-Hermitage and Cornas were
all sufficiently distinctive to warrant separate appellations.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What would be the basis for the differences? Soils, drainage,
microclimates, elevations, angles of inclination toward the sun,
viticulture and, yes, the human element, all play a role. Terroir, in
short.

Of course, we would be naïve not to acknowledge other factors, like
economics and politics, that influence how appellations are shaped.

When the
[St.-Joseph](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/07/17/dining/reclaiming-the-earthy-grapes-of-st-joseph.html)
appellation was founded in 1956, for example, it was intended to convey
the qualities of wine grown on steep granite hillsides clustered near
six villages. Eventually, though, because of economic and political
pressure, the appellation was extended to include flat, fertile,
easy-to-farm areas that yield inferior wines and muddy the meaning of
place.

Still, St.-Josephs made by good producers, who respect the spirit of the
appellation, ought to give good ideas of the character of a place. Here
are the three Northern Rhônes I suggest:

[**J.L. Chave
Sélection**](http://grandcruselections.com/jean-louis-chave-selections)
**Crozes-Hermitage Silène 2018 (Erin Cannon Imports, Manhasset, N.Y.)
$30**

[**J.L. Chave
Sélection**](http://grandcruselections.com/jean-louis-chave-selections)
**St.-Joseph Offerus 2017 (Erin Cannon Imports, Manhasset, N.Y.)
$31**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[**Domaine Vincent
Paris**](https://www.polanerselections.com/producer/vincent-paris)
**Cornas Granit 30 2018 (A Thomas Calder Selection/Polaner Selections,
Mount Kisco, N.Y.) $40**

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

You will note that two of the wines come from the same producer, J.L.
Chave Sélection, the négociant arm of Jean-Louis Chave, one of the great
producers of the Northern Rhône. I think these are among the best and
most accessible examples of both St.-Joseph and Crozes-Hermitage. If
Chave offered a Cornas, I might have chosen that bottle, too. Vincent
Paris is an excellent choice in his own right.

If you can’t find these bottles, please consult Wine School columns on
[St.-Joseph](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/01/07/dining/wine-school-st-joseph.html)
and
[Crozes-Hermitage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/28/dining/wine-school-assignment-crozes-hermitage.html)
for other options.

We have not covered
[Cornas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/01/dining/cornas-reds-rated-by-the-wine-panel.html)
previously, so if you cannot find the Granit 30, please consider bottles
from [Franck
Balthazar](http://saviosoaresselections.com/domaine-franck-balthazar),
[Alain Voge](https://www.alain-voge.com/en/), [Guillaume
Gilles](https://madrose.com/producers/france/cotes-du-rhone-north/domaine-guillaume-gilles/),
[Mickaël
Bourg](https://www.winemc2.com/portfolio/domaine-mickael-bourg/),
[Domaine
Lionnet](https://madrose.com/producers/france/cotes-du-rhone-north/domaine-lionnet/)
and [Jean-Baptiste
Souillard](https://www.beckywasserman.com/domaines/jean-baptiste-souillard/#.X0u6XtNKiCc).
I’m not suggesting legendary producers like Thierry Allemand and Auguste
Clape, but if you have a spare bottle, by all means go ahead and drink
it.

I like pretty much anything with Northern Rhône reds, but you can’t go
wrong with a roast chicken, various beef dishes and savory stews.

A cautionary note: You may not find compelling differences among the
wines. This is simply the beginning of an exploration, not a scientific
experiment intended to reach definitive conclusions.

If you do find differences, they may tell us little about appellations.
They may be the usual variables that would be apparent in wines made
from different producers, or different vintages in the case of the
St.-Joseph.

Differences in terroir become apparent over the course of many years of
consistent evaluation. This month’s wines are not the end, but the
beginning.
