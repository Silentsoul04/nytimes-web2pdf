The following report compiles all significant security incidents
confirmed by New York Times reporters throughout Afghanistan from the
past seven days. It is necessarily incomplete as many local officials
refuse to confirm casualty information. The report includes government
claims of insurgent casualty figures, but in most cases these cannot be
independently verified by The Times. Similarly, the reports do not
include Taliban claims for their attacks on the government unless they
can be verified. Both sides routinely inflate casualty totals for their
opponents.

At least 45 pro-government forces and 27 civilians were killed in
Afghanistan during the past week, as the government declared all
obstacles to peace talks cleared, with negotiations expected to resume
shortly. The deadliest attack took place in Kandahar Province, where a
van was hit by a roadside bomb planted by the Taliban in the Loykarez
area of Spin Boldak District, killing 12 members of one family,
including women and children. Later in the week, in Khost Province, a
vehicle carrying police forces came under Taliban attack in the center
of Qalamwal Mina in Khost City, the provincial capital, while patrolling
the area. Six police officers were killed and another was wounded.
