Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestler known as the Rock,
announced on Instagram on Wednesday that he and his family had recently
tested positive for the coronavirus.

Mr. Johnson, 48, said they had become infected around two and a half
weeks ago, from “very close family friends.” He called it “one of the
most challenging and difficult things we have ever had to endure as a
family,” but added that he and his family were now “on the other end of
it” and were healthy and no longer contagious.

While the symptoms were mild for his youngest daughters, Jasmine and
Tiana, Mr. Johnson said he and his wife had a “rough go” with the virus.

Mr. Johnson also urged people to wear masks.

“It baffles me that some people out there — including some politicians —
will take this idea of wearing masks and make it part of a political
agenda,” he said.

“It has nothing to do with politics,” he said. “Wear your mask.”

Mr. Johnson added that his mother, who had part of her lungs removed
before recovering from lung cancer, still wears a mask “every day.”

His announcement comes as coronavirus cases increase around the world,
with over 26 million people infected and at least 862,000 dead from the
virus, according to a [New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).

In the United States, at least 1,074 deaths and over 40,000 new cases
were reported on Wednesday, when Mr. Johnson posted to Instagram about
his experience with Covid-19.

While Mr. Johnson said he and his family still trust the friends from
whom they contracted the coronavirus, he advised people to take all
precautions before seeing others. “Think twice about who you have over
to your house,” he said.

Mr. Johnson joins [a long list of
celebrities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-celebrities-actors-politicians.html),
athletes and public figures who have contracted the virus and called on
the public to treat it seriously by wearing masks, social distancing and
taking other precautions. The list includes Hollywood stars like Tom
Hanks and his wife, the actress Rita Wilson; athletes like the
basketball players Kevin Durant and Rudy Gobert; and world leaders such
as Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain.
