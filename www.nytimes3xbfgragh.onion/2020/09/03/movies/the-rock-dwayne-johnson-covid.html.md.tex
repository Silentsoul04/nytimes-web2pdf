Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestler known as the Rock,
announced on Instagram on Wednesday that he and his family had recently
tested positive for the coronavirus.

Mr. Johnson, 48, said they had become infected around two and a half
weeks ago, from ``very close family friends.'' He called it ``one of the
most challenging and difficult things we have ever had to endure as a
family,'' but added that he and his family were now ``on the other end
of it'' and were healthy and no longer contagious.

While the symptoms were mild for his youngest daughters, Jasmine and
Tiana, Mr. Johnson said he and his wife had a ``rough go'' with the
virus.

Mr. Johnson also urged people to wear masks.

``It baffles me that some people out there --- including some
politicians --- will take this idea of wearing masks and make it part of
a political agenda,'' he said.

``It has nothing to do with politics,'' he said. ``Wear your mask.''

Mr. Johnson added that his mother, who had part of her lungs removed
before recovering from lung cancer, still wears a mask ``every day.''

His announcement comes as coronavirus cases increase around the world,
with over 26 million people infected and at least 862,000 dead from the
virus, according to a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{New
York Times database}.

In the United States, at least 1,074 deaths and over 40,000 new cases
were reported on Wednesday, when Mr. Johnson posted to Instagram about
his experience with Covid-19.

While Mr. Johnson said he and his family still trust the friends from
whom they contracted the coronavirus, he advised people to take all
precautions before seeing others. ``Think twice about who you have over
to your house,'' he said.

Mr. Johnson joins
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-celebrities-actors-politicians.html}{a
long list of celebrities}, athletes and public figures who have
contracted the virus and called on the public to treat it seriously by
wearing masks, social distancing and taking other precautions. The list
includes Hollywood stars like Tom Hanks and his wife, the actress Rita
Wilson; athletes like the basketball players Kevin Durant and Rudy
Gobert; and world leaders such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson of
Britain.
