# A Few Students Threw Parties. Now an Entire SUNY Campus Is Shut Down.

More than 500 State University of New York, Oneonta, students tested
positive for the coronavirus less than two weeks after classes began.

In late August, less than a week after classes started, the State
University of New York at Oneonta suspended five students who, officials
said, had organized parties in the upstate town that might have led to a
coronavirus outbreak on campus.

But it was already too late.

Five days later, the outbreak was out of control, with [more than 500
virus cases](https://t.e2ma.net/message/l0xndc/96qt6se) among a campus
student population that is usually around 6,000.

As a result, officials announced on Thursday that they were canceling
in-person classes for the fall semester and sending students home,
making Oneonta the first SUNY campus to shut down because of the virus
after trying to reopen for classes.

“Despite the diligence of the vast majority of our SUNY Oneonta
students, faculty and staff, the actions of a few individuals who didn’t
comply resulted in the spread of Covid-19 over the past week,” Jim
Malatras, SUNY’s chancellor, said in a statement.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With New York City public schools set to reopen at the end of the month,
the closing of the campus was a troubling reminder of how quickly virus
clusters can spiral in an academic setting, even in a state where the
infection rate has hovered around 1 percent for weeks.

The college, in Otsego County, about 80 miles west of Albany, said that
classes would be canceled on Friday to allow students to prepare to go
home. More than 50 students who were suspected of having the virus were
in quarantine on campus and 100 who had tested positive were in
isolation, [according to daily data the college has posted
online.](https://suny.oneonta.edu/covid-19)

The outbreak started small. On Aug. 25, the second day of classes,
university officials said two students had tested positive for the
virus. By Aug. 28, the number [had ballooned
to 29](https://t.e2ma.net/message/5vr3cc/96qt6se).

Two days later, after 105 students — or about 3 percent of the people
who were on campus or using campus facilities by then — had tested
positive, Mr. Malatras directed the school [to cancel all in-student
activities](https://t.e2ma.net/message/pvgadc/96qt6se) for two weeks. He
also said that in addition to suspending the five students, officials
had also suspended three campus organizations.

On Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the state was [sending a
virus-control
team](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-deploys-swat-team-suny-oneonta-contain-covid-19-cluster)
consisting of 71 contact tracers and eight case investigators to try to
quell the outbreak before it spread to the town. The state also opened
three free, rapid testing sites in the city of Oneonta.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the efforts did not apparently stem the campus outbreak. By
Wednesday, officials said that 289 cases had been confirmed after more
than 2,500 students and more than 200 employees had been tested. More
than 200 more people tested positive by Thursday.

</div>

“This is a sad day for SUNY Oneonta,” said Dr. Barbara Jean Morris, the
college’s president. “However, the actions we are taking will allow us
to put our focus back on learning.”

Before classes began, the college had not required students to show that
they had tested negative for the virus before being allowed on campus,
as many colleges around the United States have done. Students also were
not tested upon arriving for the semester.

Shortly after classes started, students began posting videos on social
media chronicling the rising number of infections and criticizing what
they said was a lack of communication about the outbreak from the
college.

After the college began testing students, faculty members and other
employees en masse, some students who tested positive filmed themselves
being woken up in the early hours of the morning and rushed into vans by
men in white hazmat suits who took them to campus locations where they
were to quarantine.

Haley Dimonda, a first-year student, said she had gotten a call shortly
before 1 a.m. Monday informing her that she had tested positive for the
virus and would have to pack her things to quarantine in a different
dormitory.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

About five minutes later, Ms. Dimonda said, a resident assistant knocked
on her door and told her that a man was waiting for her. Ms. Dimonda,
18, filmed herself, teary-eyed, following a man in a hazmat suit. She
was still in her pajamas when she was escorted out of her dorm room
carrying some of her belongings.

“I was really scared actually, because I hadn’t gotten any information,”
she said. “I was just told I was going get picked up and go to a
hall.”

### School Reopenings ›

#### Back to School

Updated Sept. 11, 2020

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.

  -   - School officials in Des Moines are refusing to hold in-person
        classes, [despite an order from Iowa’s governor and a judge’s
        ruling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/des-moines-school-opening-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup),
        risking school funding and their jobs because they think it’s
        unsafe.
      - The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had one of the
        most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus
        under control. But it [failed to account for students
        partying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/health/university-illinois-covid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).
      - College students are [using apps to shame their
        schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/technology/coronavirus-quarantines-college.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup) into
        better coronavirus plans.
      - For some families, the pandemic [has meant a return to their
        native
        languages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/parenting/family-second-language-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).

Ms. Dimonda, who does not have symptoms of the virus, was tested shortly
after the college made it [mandatory for students living on
campus](https://t.e2ma.net/message/1g9zcc/96qt6se) to be tested after
the outbreak began.

While she said she had heard of parties being held near campus after
students arrived, she also believed the college should have required
students to be tested beforehand. The large number of cases, she said,
was “inevitable.”

“With the parties or without the parties, this would’ve happened anyway,
but people partying spread it quicker,” Ms. Dimonda said.

Although SUNY Oneonta’s recent policy does not allow students to leave
for home without the approval of the county health department, Ms.
Dimonda said that her parents were able to pick her up on Monday, the
day she was put in quarantine. She said she was now “stuck in my room”
on Long Island.

Otsego County has had some of the lowest positive test rates in the
state. By Thursday, the overall positive rate of those who had tested in
the county was .01 (209 positives out of 20,221 tested), [according to
state
data](https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-TableView?%3Aembed=yes&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Atabs=n).
On Thursday, the state reported 20 new cases in the county.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lizabeth Rose, who manages Peter Clark Student Rentals, a local
off-campus housing company that rents to around 400 students, said that
only the occupants of one of her houses had to quarantine, easing some
of her own concerns about those who will be remaining in town. (Students
can apply for permission to stay on campus.)

“I think most of the students are doing the right thing,” Ms. Rose said.

SUNY Oneonta is not the only university struggling to control cases and
quarantine students while trying to conduct in-person classes.

On Thursday, officials at Syracuse University, about 85 miles northwest
of Oneonta, [said they had detected traces of the
virus](https://twitter.com/chrishipp15_/status/1301616678925721601?s=20)
in wastewater coming from one dorm. Officials ordered students in the
dorm to return to their rooms and said all residents there would be
tested.

Several colleges and universities, including Notre Dame and the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, had previously canceled
in-person classes after hundreds of students were found to have the
virus, often following reports of large parties.

More than 40 students at SUNY, Plattsburgh, which is about 160 miles
north of Albany, were placed on interim suspension after an outdoor
gathering. Small liberal arts colleges like Marist College and larger
universities like the Ohio State University have ordered students off
campus because of parties. More than 1,000 cases have been detected at
both [the University of South
Carolina](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/world/coronavirus-covid-live.html)
and t[he University of
Alabama](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/08/28/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-alabama.html).
