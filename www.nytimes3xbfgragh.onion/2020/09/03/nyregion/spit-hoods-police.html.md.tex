Them?}\label{what-are-spit-hoods-and-why-do-the-police-use-them}}

Daniel Prude died in Rochester after officers covered his head with a
hood. The devices are widely used, but the N.Y.P.D. does not give them
to patrol officers.

Shortly before
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/nyregion/daniel-prude-police-rochester.html}{Daniel
Prude} lost consciousness while the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/nyregion/rochester-police-chief-resigns-prude.html}{Rochester
police} held him down, one of the officers had pulled a white hood from
his pocket and slipped it over Mr. Prude's head.

The mesh hood is a common device that the police and correction officers
use, known as a ``spit hood'' or ``spit sock.'' It was intended to keep
Mr. Prude, who had been spitting on the ground, from exposing them to
disease.

Earlier that night, Mr. Prude, who had a history of mental illness, had
run out of his brother's home naked and was behaving erratically,
telling at least one person that he had the coronavirus, according to
police reports.

The officers
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/nyregion/daniel-prude-police-rochester.html}{went
on to hold Mr. Prude down on the pavement for two minutes}, his head
still wrapped in the sack, as he lost consciousness and his pulse
stopped. Paramedics restarted his heart, but he died a week later in a
hospital. An autopsy found the cause of death was ``complications of
asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.''

Mr. Prude's death, along with the jarring body camera footage of him
being subdued, has brought new scrutiny to the longstanding use of spit
hoods and similar devices by law enforcement.

\subsection{What is a spit hood?}\label{what-is-a-spit-hood}}

A spit hood, or spit guard, is a loose, breathable fabric sack that can
be placed over a person's head to prevent them from biting or spitting.

There are many designs, but the hoods usually are made of a porous,
breathable fabric, often a mesh that allows officers to see the
suspect's face. Many hoods have an elastic band designed to stay loosely
secured around a person's neck.

The devices are intended to keep an emotionally disturbed person from
biting or spitting on an officer, not just to prevent the spread of
diseases but also to avoid other injuries.

``People quite frankly underestimate the level of danger that officers
can face from individuals that are using their mouths and their teeth,''
said Maria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at John Jay College
of Criminal Justice, in New York City.

The coronavirus pandemic and the risk that officers could
\href{https://nypost.com/2020/04/18/nypd-giving-tickets-to-perps-with-coronavirus-who-spit-on-others/}{be
infected by a suspect's saliva} have drawn attention to the use of spit
hoods, though it is difficult to track whether use of the devices has
increased in the last six months.

\hypertarget{who-uses-them-and-why}{%
\subsection{Who uses them and why?}\label{who-uses-them-and-why}}

The use of spit hoods or spit shields is widespread among medics, prison
guards and the police, throughout the United States and
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/police-in-ireland-ramp-up-use-of-controversial-spit-hoods-2020-5}{internationally}.

Authorities in many European countries use the device to shield
themselves from infectious diseases, and many American police
departments also employ them as a restraining device.

\href{https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/spit-hoods-police-met-london-scotland-yard-suspects-cressida-dick-crime-a8767826.html}{Scotland
Yard} announced last year that it would supply all officers with spit
hoods; the Garda, Ireland's national police force, began
\href{https://www.businessinsider.com/police-in-ireland-ramp-up-use-of-controversial-spit-hoods-2020-5}{deploying
the device} more widely early this year. Most police departments in the
United States have them on hand.

Policies on spit masks vary among major police departments; some will
not allow the devices to be used on children, or on a person who has
been pepper-sprayed.

Chris Petzer, the owner of Handcuff Warehouse, a Virginia-based law
enforcement equipment company that supplies spit hoods, said the
emergence of the coronavirus has only heightened the growing demand for
the devices.

Spit hoods are more often used by corrections officers, in prisons and
jails, Mr. Petzer said, and many police departments do not issue them to
patrol officers.

The New York Police Department is one of the departments that does not
give spit guards to patrol officers, a spokesman, Al Baker, said.

Because of the coronavirus epidemic, however, the department has begun
issuing them to emergency services officers, who are also trained as
medics, on a trial basis, Mr. Baker said.

\hypertarget{are-spit-hoods-dangerous}{%
\subsection{Are spit hoods dangerous?}\label{are-spit-hoods-dangerous}}

A medical study published in 2019 found the use of a spit hood produced
\href{https://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(18)30806-4/fulltext}{``no
clinically significant changes''} in a person's ability to breathe,
provided he or she was healthy.

``Most of the time, they are safe unless a person has an underlying
condition,'' Ms. Haberfeld said.

But a spit hood is often used in combination with other restraints, as
it was in Mr. Prude's case. After putting the hood on his head, three
officers held Mr. Prude down, one pressing his head to the pavement, one
placing a knee on his back and a third holding down his legs.

Neil Gehlawat, a California lawyer who has sued on behalf of several
people who died after being restrained in a spit hood, said the devices
can lead to physiological stress, like trouble breathing or an increased
heart rate.

``You'll have the person who is being restrained, usually in a prone
position so they're facedown, there's already pressure on the
diaphragm,'' he said. ``And then a spit mask is being put on top of that
person, that further restricts their ability to breathe.''

He added: ``They're really restricting airflow, and they can often lead
to people asphyxiating and dying.''

\hypertarget{have-the-devices-played-a-role-in-other-deaths}{%
\subsection{Have the devices played a role in other
deaths?}\label{have-the-devices-played-a-role-in-other-deaths}}

Spit hoods have been involved in at least 10 deaths in police custody
since 2001, though it is difficult to determine how much the spit hood
contributed to those deaths.

In April,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/carlos-ingram-lopez-death-tucson-police.html}{Carlos
Ingram Lopez}, a 27-year-old cooking school graduate, died in Tucson,
Ariz., after police held him down and covered his face with a blanket
and a hood. Like Mr. Prude, Mr. Lopez was in the middle of a mental
health breakdown.

Jacob Bauer died in Pleasanton, Calif., in August 2018 after police
restrained him with batons and tasers and applied a spit mask to his
face. Prosecutors later
\href{https://www.pleasantonweekly.com/news/2020/03/20/pleasanton-pd-officers-cleared-of-criminal-charges-for-mans-death-after-confrontation-outside-raleys}{cleared
the officers} involved in Mr. Bauer's death of criminal wrongdoing.

Even in cases where someone has not died, the use of spit hoods has
stirred controversy and prompted lawsuits.

Police officers in Sacramento, for instance, placed a hood on the head
of a 12-year-old boy, who officers said was spitting at them, in April
2019. A
\href{https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article236408518.html}{video of
the incident} went viral online, and the boy's family sued the
Sacramento police department for \$100,000, claiming the boy had been
traumatized.
