One hazy evening last month — as I was sitting on a wooden picnic bench
at the new pizza place Ollie’s in High Falls, N.Y. — I felt a sudden
wave of nostalgia for sleep-away camp, where I (now somewhat
implausibly) spent weeks in proximity to hundreds of other children each
summer as a kid. Ollie’s, which is a family-run operation, offers a
similar kind of uncomplicated joy and camaraderie, with a focus on
simple pleasures — in this case, sheets of Roman-style pizza and
gooey-crusted Neapolitan pies you can order from the window of a
19th-century blackened wood barn and then eat on a lawn bordered by
overgrown banks of wildflowers such as orange cosmos, zinnias and
milkweed. Two of the restaurant’s three founders, Ilan Bachrach and
Innis Lawrence, met as kids at a summer camp just nearby (Lawrence grew
up and now lives in High Falls with the restaurant’s third co-founder,
Sophie Peltzer-Rollo, and their 3-year-old daughter, Ollie, after whom
the restaurant is named). Additionally, one of the trio’s close friends,
Frank Pinello, of [Best
Pizza](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/03/09/dining/reviews/09under.html)
in Brooklyn, is a partner in the venture and helped develop the recipe
for its proprietary dough, which is made using locally grown and milled
flour. The crust, at once chewy and gently charred, is so good I drove
back one afternoon through a thunderstorm for more. *4 Bruceville Road,

With their new needlepoint company, [Loop
Canvas](https://www.instagram.com/loopcanvas/), the sisters Amy and
Sarah Blessing are inviting everyone into their lifelong love affair
with crafting. During a trip to London about 10 years ago, the pair
marveled at the fine needlepoints at [Liberty
London](https://www.libertylondon.com/us/home?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo5uIwPLK6wIVC43ICh2kfwcIEAAYASAAEgKVEPD_BwE).
“They had the most elaborate and traditional canvases — beautiful
hand-painted scenes of things like a cat in a basket,” says Sarah
Blessing. “But you could be working on it for 12 years and not want it
in your home when it’s finished.” Agreeing that the requisite price and
time commitment stopped many people from starting to needlepoint, they
plotted a new course for the craft. While co-quarantining with their
families in Traverse City, Mich., they brought their business idea to
life. Loop updates the centuries-old art with simple, two-color
silhouettes that the novice can master and the enthusiast will still
enjoy. Digitally printing their designs on canvas (instead of
hand-painting them) has also allowed them to keep the price point under
$100. “This is our form of meditation,” says Amy Blessing. The company’s
initial offering of flora, fauna and insect designs are available on its
website, with a children’s collection and collaborations with the
fashion designer Clare Vivier and the home-goods designer Heather Taylor
coming soon. *$88 per set,*

Located in Mexico City’s historic downtown — where one of the oldest
Spanish cathedrals in the Americas rests atop the ceremonial center of
the Aztec world — the Círculo Mexicano is housed in a 19th-century
townhome that’s been transformed into a Shaker-inspired boutique hotel
by the hotel developer [Grupo
Habita](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2013/02/24/travel/not-your-average-hostels.html)
and the architecture firm [Ambrosi
Etchegaray](http://ambrosietchegaray.com/). As an ode to Manuel Álvarez
Bravo, the building’s former resident and one of Mexico’s most
celebrated 20th-century photographers, Círculo Mexicano features the
artist’s works in its lobby, which is also home to several shops,
including Atlawa, which carries resin kitchenware, and Templo, where
you’ll find a collection of artisanal Oaxacan pottery. In the
cobblestone courtyard, the chef [Gabriela
Cámara](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/04/dining/gabriela-camara-mexican-food.html),
of Contramar, helms a seafood restaurant and a cantina-style bar called
Itacate del Mar, while the rooftop terrace is the setting for a
contemporary French-inspired restaurant — as well as a swimming pool,
sauna and soaking tub — where guests can enjoy views of the Metropolitan
Cathedral, the National Palace and the Templo Mayor. The private patios
attached to each of the 25 guest rooms and suites, which are furnished
with custom oak pieces by the local design studio La Metropolitana, also
make for good lookout spots. *Starting at $150 a night,*

I had the occasion of meeting the San Leandro, Calif.-based artist
William Scott last year when I visited Creative Growth, the Oakland
nonprofit that provides a professional studio environment, gallery
exhibitions and representation for artists with developmental
disabilities. Scott is self-taught, and he frequently references figures
in pop culture — from Frankenstein’s monster to Janet Jackson to Darth
Vader — in a wholesome and sci-fi-inflected textual and visual
vernacular that is distinctly his own. His new show, “[It’s a Beautiful
Day
Outside](http://www.ortuzarprojects.com/exhibitions/william-scott/works?view=slider),”
featuring drawing, painting, sculpture and original video, will be on
view this month at the TriBeCa gallery Ortuzar Projects; it’s the first
exhibition of his work in New York City since he showed at White Columns
11 years ago. If 2020 is a year of reckoning, then Scott’s pieces —
which convey unbridled optimism and Black beauty — are powerful
reminders of what we need more of in this world. They also make me think
of the smile that crossed the face of David Byrne — who is one of
Creative Growth’s most devoted supporters and a fan of Scott’s work —
after he greeted the artist at the nonprofit’s fund-raiser last year.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art has finally (and cautiously) reopened,
just in time to celebrate [its 150th
anniversary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/arts/design/met-museum-reopens-anniversary.html).
To honor it, the Met Store has launched a multi-designer capsule
collection of housewares, tech accessories, fashion and beauty items
inspired by iconic works of art that belong to the museum. The beauty
brand Estée Lauder looked to Fernand Léger’s “[The
Village](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/500488)”
(1914). The abstract painting — believed to be one of the last Léger
made before the outbreak of World War I — depicts in bright, primary
colors a small village, playfully rendered in cylindrical shapes and
spheres. Green trees run along the village’s perimeter, encircling a
church and bell tower. Childlike but modern, the painting catches Europe
on the brink of change. Its tones, along with the Met’s signature red
hue, are reflected in the packaging and pigments of a limited-edition
eye-shadow palette, lipstick set and powder compact. Considering that
Léger was among the last century’s greatest painters, one whose
experimentation with Cubism presaged the more playful Pop Art movement,
it seems only fitting to have his work on a palette to enjoy ourselves.
Estée Lauder is donating 100 percent of the proceeds to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art through March 2021, or until sold out. *From $52,*
