</div>

Law enforcement agents killed Michael Forest Reinoehl while trying to
arrest him, four officials said. He was being investigated in the fatal
shooting of a supporter of a far-right group.

LACEY, Wash. — Law enforcement agents shot and killed an antifa
supporter on Thursday as they moved to arrest him in the fatal shooting
of a right-wing activist who was part of a pro-Trump caravan in
Portland, Ore., officials said.

The suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, was shot by officers from a
federally led fugitive task force during the encounter in Washington
State, according to the U.S. Marshals Service.

“Initial reports indicate the suspect produced a firearm, threatening
the lives of law enforcement officers,” the Marshals Service said in a
statement. “Task force members responded to the threat and struck the
suspect who was pronounced dead at the scene.”

Lt. Ray Brady of the Thurston County Sheriff’s Office said in an
interview that the suspect being sought by the law enforcement team had
exited an apartment and got into a vehicle.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“As they attempted to apprehend him, there was gunfire,” Lieutenant
Brady said. He said four law enforcement officers fired their weapons.

Lieutenant Brady said that Mr. Reinoehl had a handgun with him, but
added on Friday that “we are not able to confirm at this time if he
fired shots” and that he was not aware of there being any body camera
recordings of the episode.

An arrest warrant for murder had been obtained by the Portland police
through the Circuit Court in Multnomah County, Ore., earlier Thursday,
on the same day that [Vice News published an
interview](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7g8vb/man-linked-to-killing-at-a-portland-protest-says-he-acted-in-self-defense)
with Mr. Reinoehl in which he appeared to admit to [the Aug. 29
shooting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/us/portland-trump-rally-shooting.html),
saying, “I had no choice.”

The Portland police had been investigating Saturday’s shooting death of
[Aaron J.
Danielson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/us/portland-trump-rally-shooting.html),
one of the supporters of President Trump who came into downtown Portland
and clashed with protesters demonstrating against racial injustice and
police brutality.

Mr. Reinoehl, who lived in the Portland area, had been a persistent
presence at the city’s demonstrations over recent weeks, helping the
protesters with security and suggesting on social media that the
struggle was becoming a war where “there will be casualties.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I am 100% ANTIFA all the way\!” he posted on Instagram in June,
referring to a loose collection of activists who have mobilized to
oppose groups they see as fascist or racist. “I am willing to fight for
my brothers and sisters\! Even if some of them are too ignorant to
realize what antifa truly stands for. We do not want violence but we
will not run from it either\!”

In the Vice interview, Mr. Reinoehl said he had acted in self-defense,
believing that he and a friend were about to be stabbed. “I could have
sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color, but I wasn’t
going to do that,” he said.

An hour before his fatal encounter with law enforcement, Mr. Reinoehl
was on the telephone with Tiffanie Wickwire, who was helping him set up
a GoFundMe page, Ms. Wickwire said in an interview.

“We were talking about his kids and what to do for them if anything
happened to him,” she said, referring to his 17-year-old son and
11-year-old daughter.

“Stay safe,” they told each other at the end of the call, she said.

The Pacific Northwest Violent Offender Task Force that attempted to
arrest Mr. Reinoehl included members of the U.S. Marshals Service, the
Lakewood Police Department, the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department and
the Washington State Department of Corrections.

After Mr. Reinoehl was killed by law enforcement, Attorney General
William P. Barr[said in a
statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-william-p-barr-tracking-down-fugitive-michael-forest-reinoehl)
that “the streets of our cities are safer.” The federal government’s
ability to track Mr. Reinoehl down, he said, was “an unmistakable
demonstration that the United States will be governed by law, not
violent mobs.”

Mr. Barr formed a task force this summer to investigate the
proliferation of violent anti-government extremists as citizens across
the country protested the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis
police. The F.B.I. has opened hundreds of investigations related to
extremist activity, but has predominately charged actors on the far
right.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But in his public statements, Mr. Barr has pinned the violence on
leftist groups and movements, particularly antifa, and echoed President
Trump’s assertions that actors on the left are inciting violent riots.

The officers closed in on Mr. Reinoehl on a residential street lined
with townhomes and single-family houses in an unincorporated area
adjacent to the city of Lacey, not far from the Washington State capital
of Olympia and about two hours’ drive north of
Portland.

Chad Smith, 29, who lives next door to the apartment where the shooting
occurred, said he was standing outside at about 6:45 p.m. when he saw
two S.U.V.s race toward the complex. He heard about a minute and a half
of gunshots, he said, then saw a man walking backward next to a white
pickup truck, holding what appeared to be a gun, and officers firing in
his direction.

Trevor Brown, 24, who lives in a townhouse nearby, said he heard several
shots fired and saw as many as four police officers in the road, who
fired three or four times. He said he then saw a man lying on the
ground.

Jashon Spencer, who also lives not far away, also heard the gunshots. “I
just heard a whole bunch of pops,” Mr. Spencer said. “I ducked. I
thought they were shooting in my yard.”

He said that he went out and saw a bloodied man in the street, and a
video he took showed a law enforcement officer attempting CPR.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After the shooting, several hundred protesters in Portland gathered in
front of a police station in a residential neighborhood, chanting racial
justice slogans as they have on most nights since May, although the mood
shortly before midnight was relatively calm.

“There’s blood on your hands. You murdered Michael Reinoehl,” someone
had posted in the street outside a law enforcement building. “Michael
was murdered,” said another posting.

Later in the evening, police officers charged the crowd and took one
person into custody.

As part of the protesters’ security team during the demonstrations, Mr.
Reinoehl’s role included intercepting potential agitators and helping
calm conflicts, fellow protesters said.

“Nightly, he would break up fights,” said Randal McCorkle, a regular at
the demonstrations who said he became close friends with Mr. Reinoehl as
they wore on.

“He wanted change so badly,” he said. His death, he said, would likely
inspire others to continue the movement for police reform. “I was going
to say radicalize, but galvanize is a better word,” he said. “Honestly,
I’m going to try to step into his shoes.”

Reese Monson, a leader in the local protest movement who also helps
organize security, said all the people who helped with security in
Portland, including Mr. Reinoehl, were trained on de-escalation.

“He was excellent at that,” Mr. Monson said.

Mr. Monson said the security designees have been trained to approach
potential agitators and politely ask them to leave. They have also been
trained on how to conduct physical removals but are cautioned to try to
avoid such measures because they can cause situations to escalate. Mr.
Monson said Mr. Reinoehl would often come over to discuss how
to<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>handle potential agitators
appropriately.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“He was literally a guardian angel,” said Teal Lindseth, one of the main
organizers of the Portland protests. “He would protect you no matter
what.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Early on Friday, Ms. Lindseth spray-painted a tribute to Mr. Reinoehl on
the street in front of the police precinct where demonstrators were
gathered. “Long Live Mike,” she wrote, “the best ally ever.”

He sometimes ran into trouble, though. On July 5 during the protests,
Mr. Reinoehl was charged with resisting arrest and possession of a
loaded firearm in a case that was later dropped. At the end of July, he
showed a bloodied arm to a journalist [with Bloomberg QuickTake
News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfMnZX7Z56o) and said he had been
shot while intervening in a fight.

The night<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>when Mr. Danielson
was shot began with a large crowd of supporters of Mr. Trump gathering
in the suburbs. They planned to drive hundreds of vehicles carrying
flags around the highways of Portland, but many of them eventually drove
downtown, where protesters have been congregating regularly. Once there,
some Trump supporters shot paintballs into the crowd, while people on
the streets threw objects back at them. Fistfights broke out.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As evening turned into night, [video appeared to
show](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/video/portland-protests-shooting-investigation.html)
Mr. Danielson, who was wearing a hat with the insignia of the far-right
group Patriot Prayer, and Mr. Reinoehl on a street along with a few
other people. One person was shouting, “We’ve got a couple right here.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The man who captured video of the shooting, Justin Dunlap, said it
appeared that Mr. Danielson reached to his hip.

“He pulled from his side, just like he was pulling a gun,” Mr. Dunlap
said.

But in other video taken during the encounter, someone can be heard
flagging that Mr. Danielson was pulling out a can of mace. “He’s macing
you, he’s pulling it out,” the person warned.

It appeared from the video that Mr. Danielson sprayed mace just as two
gunshots could be heard, and Mr. Danielson went down.

Portland has seen [escalating conflicts involving
guns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/portland-kenosha-protests-clashes.html)
over the past few weeks. On Aug. 15, a person allied with right-wing
demonstrators fired two shots from his vehicle, the authorities said. A
week later, during open clashes on the streets, another right-wing
demonstrator pulled out a gun.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Reinoehl said in his social media posts that he was once in the
Army, and hated it, although an Army official said no record of service
could be found under his name. In the Bloomberg interview, Mr. Reinoehl
described himself as a professional snowboarder and a contractor.

His daughter was with him during the July interview, and he said she had
also been present during the encounter that left his arm bloodied.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The fact is that she is going to be contributing to running this new
country that we’re fighting for,” Mr. Reinoehl said. “And she’s going to
learn everything on the street, not by what people have said.”

Mr. Reinoehl’s sister, who asked to remain anonymous because the family
has received numerous threatening phone calls in recent days, said
police officers asked if screenshots from videos from the night of the
shooting looked like her brother. She said they did, but she said she
had not seen him since three years ago, when she said family members
broke off contact with Mr. Reinoehl after escalating conflicts.

At the beginning of June, in the days after George Floyd’s death in
Minneapolis triggered nationwide protests, Mr. Reinoehl began posting
about the need for change.

“Things are bad right now and they can only get worse,” he posted on
June 3. “But that is how a radical change comes about.”
