\subsection{Where things stand}\label{where-things-stand}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{During the party conventions, public polling} basically took a
  two-week vacation --- did you miss it? OK, don't answer that. But
  yesterday, ready or not, we got a flood of new polls showing where
  voters stand heading into the final two months of the campaign.
\item
  Joe Biden continues to lead President Trump nationally, but his margin
  may have tightened just a bit. According to four probability-based
  (read: methodologically sound) national
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html}{polls}
  released yesterday, Biden was ahead of the president by anywhere from
  seven to 10 percentage points. In some of those polls, his lead had
  softened slightly since before the conventions.
\item
  A
  \href{https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_pa_090220/}{Monmouth
  University poll} of Pennsylvania showed Biden up on Trump by just four
  percentage points among registered voters --- within the margin of
  error, and far below his 13-point lead in July. But
  \href{https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-biden-tops-trump-among-likely-voters-in-key-states}{Fox
  News polls} from Arizona, North Carolina and Wisconsin all showed
  Biden essentially maintaining or even expanding his advantages in
  those states.
\item
  In Arizona and Wisconsin, voters preferred Biden over Trump to handle
  the issues of policing and criminal justice by a five-point margin; in
  North Carolina, voters were basically split down the middle on this.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Both Biden and Trump unveiled ads yesterday}
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/biden-ads-trump.html}{slamming
  each other for their approaches to the racial justice protests}. In
  Trump's ads, which are set to air in
  \href{https://youtu.be/Vx6_jhXhL54}{Minnesota} and
  \href{https://youtu.be/JTfDgCCpXTE}{Wisconsin}, his campaign doubles
  down on the argument that Biden has condoned violence at marches.
\item
  But in
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgHXJ3rdOn0\&feature=youtu.be}{his
  own ad}, Biden sought to directly undercut that claim. ``I want to
  make it absolutely clear: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not
  protesting,'' he says in footage taken from a speech he gave this week
  in Pittsburgh. ``It's lawlessness, plain and simple.''
\item
  Biden's campaign announced yesterday that together with the Democratic
  National Committee,
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/02/us/trump-vs-biden/biden-shatters-fund-raising-records-with-a-364-5-million-haul-in-august}{it
  had raised a staggering \$364.5 million} in August --- a monthly
  record, and more than his and Trump's July totals combined.
\item
  Today Biden will travel to Kenosha, Wis., where the police shooting of
  Jacob Blake last month gave rise to days of protests that have
  sometimes turned destructive --- and where a teenage Trump supporter
  has been charged in the killings of two people. Biden will meet with
  members of the Blake family and attend a community meeting. Trump will
  head to Latrobe, Pa., to deliver a speech this evening.
\item
  \textbf{While he's pushing back hard against Trump's efforts} to label
  him as soft on crime, Biden knows that the
  \href{https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx}{top
  issue} on many voters' minds remains the coronavirus pandemic.
\item
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/biden-schools-trump-coronavirus.html}{Yesterday
  he sought to refocus attention on Covid-19, and what he considers a
  major vulnerability} for Trump: the difficult process of reopening
  schools amid the outbreak. ``Mr. President, where are you?'' Biden
  asked during a speech to reporters in Wilmington, Del., saying that
  the president ``still doesn't have any real plan for how to open our
  schools safely.''
\item
  As if to underscore the urgency of the situation, statistics on the
  University of South Carolina's website show that as of yesterday, over
  1,000 students had tested positive for the virus and were currently
  active cases. The university's data reflected a nearly 28 percent
  positive test rate, well into the zone that epidemiologists say
  indicates the virus is out of control.
\item
  \textbf{Speaking to reporters yesterday at the White House}, Trump
  appeared to encourage voters in North Carolina to commit a felony:
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-people-vote-twice.html}{He
  said they should try to vote twice} --- once by mail, then again in
  person --- to stress-test the state's voting system.
\item
  ``Let them send it in and let them go vote, and if their system's as
  good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote,''
  the president said. ``That's the way it is,'' he added. ``And that's
  what they should do.''
\item
  It wasn't immediately clear whether Trump is seeking to overwhelm and
  undermine the state's voting system, or if he thinks he might actually
  gain an advantage if his supporters cast multiple ballots. What is
  clear is that he has now called on his supporters to engage in the
  kind of election fraud he has long railed against.
\item
  \textbf{Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security}
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-biden-russia-election.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{intervened
  to prevent the publication of an intelligence report raising alarms}
  about Russian interference in the 2020 election, according to a report
  by ABC News yesterday.
\item
  The intelligence bulletin, from July, sought to inform state and local
  law enforcement officials that Russian state media agencies were
  posting ``allegations about the poor mental health of 2020 Democratic
  presidential candidate Joe Biden.''
\item
  Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, told Fox News
  yesterday that the report had been held up because it was ``very
  poorly written,'' and said that his office planned to release it in
  some form soon. But Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the
  agency during the Trump administration, told CNN that the news fit a
  pattern.
\item
  ``We had instances like this happen, where the White House didn't want
  us to talk about Russian election interference, and we had to go
  around the White House to do it anyway,'' Taylor said.

Joe Biden and Jill Biden held a briefing yesterday with education and
health experts in Wilmington.

\subsection{Did Massachusetts crack the code on conducting a smooth
election during the pandemic? It's
complicated.}\label{did-massachusetts-crack-the-code-on-conducting-a-smooth-election-during-the-pandemic-its-complicated}}

If you're looking to this week's primary election in Massachusetts for
clues about how the general election might go in November, the answer is
mixed.

Thanks in part to the state's decision to send out absentee ballot
applications to all registered voters for the first time,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/us/politics/massachusetts-election-voting.html}{participation
was higher than ever before in a Massachusetts congressional primary},
as our reporters
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/nick-corasaniti}{Nick
Corasaniti}} and ****
\textbf{\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/stephanie-saul}{Stephanie
Saul}} **** explain in a new article.

And because the state put in place a relatively strict set of
vote-by-mail policies, while avoiding the kind of interparty lawsuits
that have bedeviled swing states this year, enough results were in by
Tuesday night to allow some winners to be declared that evening.

But those same strict policies --- including a court ruling that ballots
received after 8 p.m. on Tuesday could not be counted --- might also
have disenfranchised a significant number of voters, some election
experts said.

``I would not want to judge the success of an election based on how
quickly they're able to produce election results,'' Wendy Weiser, the
director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice,
told Nick and Stephanie.
