KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — The setup of the two friends’ agricultural
venture was unusual. Their farm sat next to a gas station, inside a
shipping container where the plants grew in vertically stacked shelves.
And the timing of their first sales — during the early days of
Malaysia’s coronavirus outbreak — seemed less than ideal.

“We were a nascent product in an uncertain market,” said Shawn Ng, 28, a
co-founder of the vertical farm, [the Vegetable
Co](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/thevegetable.co/about/?ref=page_internal).
“We weren’t too sure if it would take off.”

“But somehow,” he added, “the market kind of played in our favor.”

As in-person shopping wanes during the pandemic, Mr. Ng’s Malaysia-based
operation is [one of many small farms around the
world](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/08/nyregion/small-farms-ny-coronavirus.html)
that are selling fresh produce directly to consumers in ways that bypass
brick-and-mortar grocery stores.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some farms sell on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Lazada, Alibaba’s
online emporium for Southeast Asia, or through smaller ones like
[Harvie](https://www.harvie.farm/), a Pennsylvania-based website that
connects consumers with individual farms across the United States and
Canada.

Others, like [the Vegetable
Co](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/thevegetable.co/about/?ref=page_internal).,
sell directly to customers.

“I was very ‘kan cheong’ during the lockdown period,” said one of Mr.
Ng’s regular customers, Ayu Samsudin, using a Cantonese word for
anxious. “Having fresh vegetables delivered to your doorstep was such a
relief.”

The Vegetable Co. consists of a 320-square-foot shipping container on
the edge of a parking lot in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s largest city. It
opened for business, with just a handful of customers, about a month
before the country’s restrictive lockdown took effect in
mid-March.

Revenue grew by 300 percent in the first few weeks, and the shipping
container is now approaching production capacity because of high demand,
said Mr. Ng’s business partner, Sha G.P.

Apart from the gas station, the shipping container’s other neighbors are
a driving range and an oil palm plantation. Inside, tightly packed
shelves with hydroponic lettuce, sprouts and other vegetables grow under
LED
lights.

The wallpaper outside the growing chamber shows blue sky and clouds,
evoking the view from an old-fashioned farm. But employees pace the
chamber’s narrow corridor wearing rubber gloves, surgical masks and
white lab coats, as if it were a hospital ward.

The founders have scant experience with traditional farming, and they
speak about their work with Silicon Valley-like jargon.

Mr. Sha said he first became interested in vertical farming after
watching “[The
Martian](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/10/02/movies/review-in-the-martian-marooned-but-not-alone.html),”
the 2015 film in which an American astronaut played by Matt Damon is

with the elegance of the solution to grow vegetables in a zero-gravity

The coronavirus took off in Malaysia in March, after an Islamic
revivalist group’s gathering there became [one of the pandemic’s biggest
vectors](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/world/asia/coronavirus-malaysia-muslims-outbreak.html)in
Southeast Asia. Since then, the country of about 32 million has
weathered the outbreak relatively well, at least compared with some of
its neighbors. As of Thursday, it had reported fewer than 10,000
confirmed cases since the pandemic began, [according to a New York Times

Malaysia’s initial lockdown allowed only one person per household to go
outside for essential errands, and the police enforced local travel
restrictions with roadblocks.

But even though the rules were gradually loosened to let most businesses
reopen, many urban Malaysians have maintained the online shopping habits
they developed during the initial lockdown, said Audrey Goo, the founder
of [MyFishman](https://myfishman.com/), an e-commerce platform that
connects fishermen from villages along the country’s west coast with
consumers in Kuala
Lumpur.

“Not many end users are willing to go back to the wet market,” said Ms.
Goo, adding that her company’s sales had roughly doubled during the
pandemic. “So I think the whole business model will continue to change.”

Mr. Ng said the Vegetable Co.’s parent company, Future Farms, was now
seeking seed capital to finance an expansion into a larger facility. He
recently hired an architect and a software developer to design it.

For now, though, the operation remains modest.

On a recent afternoon, Mr. Ng climbed into his car for a delivery run
that snaked through low-rise residential neighborhoods, as the sun sank
below Kuala Lumpur’s hazy downtown skyline.

One of the customers on the 40-plus-mile route, Gudrun Olafsdottir, said
that along with yoga and meditation, greens from the Vegetable Co. were
part of a routine that helped her keep physically and mentally fit
during the pandemic.

Ms. Olafsdottir, who is from Iceland and works in retail, found the farm
on Facebook through a local chef who specializes in raw and vegan
cooking. She said it was one of several local businesses that she was
supporting these days with a “financial hug.”

“I think that we could do so many things to support those in need if we
just consciously choose how we spend our time and money,” she has
written on her blog. “A hug and a
squeeze.”
