They used to arrive before dawn. Hundreds of them came to scream and
leap and wave posters scrawled with the names of their hometowns as they
vied to be caught on camera among the “Today” show crowd. “People dream
about coming to 30 Rockefeller Plaza,” Hoda Kotb, the show’s co-anchor,
told me recently over Zoom after a show. But for the last several
months, Kotb has heard the eerie sound of her own footsteps as she heads
into the studio and slips behind the anchor desk, where she perches at a
socially distanced remove from her co-stars and broadcasts in front of a
ghostly plaza. One morning, she spied some movement outside the window —
it was a nurse in scrubs, lugging a rolling suitcase — and Kotb was so
hungry for a taste of audience connection, “I literally held my phone
number on a white piece of paper to the glass,” she said. “I was like,
‘Call me and tell me where you’re from\!’”

Since the coronavirus swept across the United States, morning-show
anchors have kept bantering, late-night hosts have kept joking and
politicians have kept stumping. It’s the audiences that have not showed.
Their sudden disappearance has spotlighted the mythical, almost
mystical, role they play in popular entertainment. The crowd has been
compared to an electric spark, a dance partner, an intoxicant and a
character in and of itself. It is said to hold great power over
professional performers, messing with their heads and triggering
hormonal surges in their glands. The crowd lends a democratic sheen to
an event, legitimizing the performer’s skill and authenticating the show
as real. If the crowd laughs, the joke was funny. If it boos, the call
was bad. The crowd is, as Kotb put it, “the juice.” And for now, it is
gone.

This has proved to be a vexing experience for the entertainers of
America. When “The View” first banished its studio audience, in March,
Whoopi Goldberg
[cried](https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/whoopi-goldberg-the-view-no-audience.html)
“Welcome to ‘The View’\! Welcome to ‘The View’\!” again and again into
silence, as cameras swept an expanse of empty seats. Before he sealed
himself into the N.B.A. bubble at Disney World, LeBron James could not
conceive of the game without a crowd,
[saying](https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1236193321053081600?lang=en):
“If I show up to an arena and there ain’t no fans there? I ain’t
playing.” When even A-list celebrities seem bored enough to appear at
events hosted on videoconferencing software, it is the crowd that has
stepped into the role of the withholding diva. A long-anticipated
reunion of “Friends” is on indefinite hold, not for David Schwimmer or
Jennifer Aniston but for the anonymous audience members tasked with
observing them: “We cannot do it without them,” Marta Kauffman, the
show’s co-creator, has
[said](https://news.yahoo.com/friends-reunion-special-audience-delay-131824866.html).

So longing are the shows for their crowds that they have grasped for
imitations. The “Today” show has erected a “[virtual

and enlisted performers of [its once-outdoor music
series](https://www.today.com/music-series) to surprise superfans at
home. In a masterwork of artifice, American ballparks and European
soccer stadiums have piped in the [crowd

created for [video

Many baseball teams have put literal stand-ins in the seats, arranging
stiff cardboard cutouts of fans in macabre tableaus; at one game, the
Washington Nationals outfielder Adam Eaton caught a fly ball and
[offered
it](http://dcsportsking.com/2020/08/17/watch-adam-eaton-give-baseball-to-cutout-baby/)
up to the frozen visage of a cardboard baby cradled in her ersatz

uncanny C.G.I. fans and fake crowd buzz into a dystopian New York

The ultimate audiences for sports, politics, talk shows and award
presentations are not found inside arenas or convention halls or studios
— they are watching from home, slack on the couch, absorbing ads and
paying for cable and streaming packages. In normal times, the live crowd
mounts a performance for the remote audience. But this summer, without
our stand-ins to guide us, we home viewers confront a void. The pretense
of the crowd always provided the true audience a bit of cover; we could
vicariously ride its emotions, feeding off its energy, absorbing its
delight and its outrage, even as we sat quietly alone at home. But now
we are directly implicated in the show itself.

**The television experience** was largely designed to replicate live
performances — to transport their spontaneous thrills into the remote
home. In his book “[Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized
Culture](https://auslander.lmc.gatech.edu/liveness-performance-in-a-mediatized-culture-1999/),”
Philip Auslander, a professor of performance studies at the Georgia
Institute of Technology, traces how TV borrowed the storytelling
conventions of the theater: it was styled as an immediate event, with
the viewer positioned at the scene of the action, as if watching from
the lip of the stage or the sideline of the court. The classic
three-camera setup mimicked the movement of the audience’s roving eye,
perhaps aided with a pair of opera glasses. And even as TV absorbed more
cinematic elements, playing with shifting perspectives and
transpositions of time, it also built up conventions that simulate the
feeling of liveness: recorded laugh tracks and cuts to the “live studio
audience,” where the crowd of spectators is vetted for entrance, warmed
up by producers and cued to applaud. And all that prompts the home
audience to feel invested in the show. “Maybe even more than the
performance, we identify with the audience,” Auslander
said.

Even as the internet disrupts these conventions again, giving rise to an
era of scattered, disembodied crowd collaboration, the figure of the
audience is pulled along for the ride. [Reaction
GIFs](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/15/15804082/greatest-reaction-gifs-supa-hot-fire-blinking-white-guy)
are sliced from evocative scenes and shared to perform the emotions of
online spectators. Often the GIFs are culled from actual television
audiences, like the anonymous woman [nodding
approvingly](https://tenor.com/view/wendy-williams-gif-6115300) in “The
Wendy Williams Show” crowd, or Chrissy Teigen’s [strained, awkward cry
face](https://giphy.com/gifs/chrissy-nancy-odell-mEqMknMZWh1Fm)caught
during a scan of the 2015 Golden Globes audience as her husband, John
Legend, won a statuette. Teigen has since emerged as our reigning
celebrity spectator; she walks among the stars but is positioned as
their observer and judge, laughing and cringing as she goes. Much of the
thrill of the modern award show is produced by celebrities reacting to
other celebrities, from Martin Scorsese blankly processing an [Eminem

The sudden absence of the crowd is scrambling entrenched media
narratives. In the N.B.A., the fans are imbued with the power to
influence the refs, psych out free-throw shooters and generally mess
with players’ heads. But the crowdless bubble has called the home-court
advantage into question and subdued the typical whiplash drama of the
playoffs, where rival teams jet back and forth across the country,
playing for adoring, then hostile, then adoring crowds; already, it’s
clear that [players are shooting
better](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nba-bubble-shooting-soccer-empty-stadiums-11596539693)
without the fans. A player in a typical series faces “the full gamut of
emotions” from the crowd, Greg Anthony, the former Knicks point guard
and Turner Sports announcer, told me from inside the bubble. The newly
muted atmosphere “could change the entire course of how the playoffs
play out,” he
said.

On late-night comedy shows, the laughter has died. In March, Samantha
Bee’s weekly TBS show, “Full Frontal,” began filming in her backyard in
upstate New York. “When I do the show in front of a live studio
audience, it’s a very communal experience,” Bee said. “We’re in it
together.” Making the crowd laugh feels “intoxicating,” she said. Now,
her jokes are met with chirping birds and buzzing cicadas, which “Full
Frontal” preserves as background noise. Her only audience is another
seasoned comedian — her husband, Jason Jones — and their three children,
who make for a tough crowd. “I’m at my most self-conscious when they’re
watching,” Bee said of her kids. “They do not think I have any comedic
ability.” The “Full Frontal” staff has coped with the dead space by
filling it with more jokes. Said Bee: “We’re just packing more and more
into the show.”

Meanwhile, politics is getting more serious. Crowdless stump speeches
are cut short — Joe Biden’s was [the shortest Democratic National
Convention acceptance
speech](https://tennesseestar.com/2020/08/22/joe-biden-gives-shortest-dnc-acceptance-speech-in-decades/)
in recent memory — and trimmed of jokes and broad applause lines
tailored to fire up the base, said David Litt, a former speechwriter for
Barack Obama. The speeches are forced to be subtler and more sincere.
Normal campaign seasons amass political crowds so large that even a
slightly amusing observation can prompt an outsize reaction. “You could
write a joke — not even a hilarious line, but a warm introductory line —
and if one-third of the people in attendance thought it was funny, that
would be 10,000 people laughing,” Litt said. For some politicians, that
feedback is the very point of the political performance. “I think it’s
one of the reasons President Trump is so desperate to get in front of
live crowds anywhere,” Litt said. Without the validation of the roaring
crowd, “You have to be able to say something and just trust that it will
sound good.”

In politics, the crowd functions as a visual and rhetorical metaphor for
democracy itself, even if — as is typical at the Democratic and
Republican national conventions — it is actually assembled from a
curated crew of delegates and party die-hards. A crowd also opens the
opportunity for performed dissent: At the 2016 D.N.C., some Bernie
Sanders delegates [staged
a](https://time.com/4425475/dnc-bernie-sanders-protest-walkout-convention/)walkout;
a few donned[green Robin Hood
hats](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/25/on-day-one-of-the-democratic-convention-the-boos-have-it/)
and stuck [duct tape over their
mouths](https://www.businessinsider.com/sanders-delegates-occupy-media-tents-dnc-2016-7).
But at this year’s convention, any protests were preemptively blocked.
Biden spoke live to a silent, darkened Delaware auditorium, then turned
to a giant screen featuring a grid of selected supporters clapping to
their webcams. The only hiccup was the video feed of one couple in the
middle, who stared blankly to the side, as if they had missed their cue
to convert from true spectators of the speech into performers of
spectating.

The crowd also offers an imprimatur of an authentic political
performance. Sean Hannity of Fox News painted Biden’s performance as a
“dull, boring speech to an empty room,” but some right-wing observers
cast it in a more sinister light: A [conspiracy
theory](https://twitter.com/johncardillo/status/1297267264715096065)
swept the conservative media accusing the D.N.C. of recording the event,
perhaps even doctoring it. It was a ludicrous claim, but it could gain
purchase because the only witnesses to the speech were campaign insiders
and journalists. A crowd is the visual assurance that something really
happened.

And in our current moment, it has taken on an even more perverse valence
— as a veil thrown over a deadly pandemic. Trump’s R.N.C. did, in fact,
feature many recorded speeches, and many more delivered to a hollow
auditorium in Washington. But on the final night, Trump [gathered a
crowd
of 1,500](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/us/politics/trump-convention-speech-white-house.html)
mostly unmasked people on the White House lawn to receive him, flouting
Washington[rules](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/phasetwo) banning large
gatherings. While the Democrats have a political and scientific
explanation for mounting an abnormal convention — it holds a mirror to
the devastation wreaked by the coronavirus under the Trump
administration — the Republicans are invested in projecting the image
that everything is fine. Trump’s crowd capably played the part of a
satisfied public. “Four more years,” it
chanted.

**Several years ago**, a friend and I attended the Video Music Awards as
members of the audience. As we filed into Madison Square Garden, we were
swept into a stream of thousands of ticket holders, corralled through
glaring white corridors and shunted up escalators into upper-deck seats.
The crowd evinced the docile resignation of workers reporting to a
factory floor. On a faraway stage, Britney Spears and Rihanna and Ariana
Grande appeared as brief glimpses of distant wildlife. We watched them
on video screens instead. It felt less like an experience than an
assignment: We had done a satisfactory job of creating the image of a
packed house.

The last few months have cracked an opportunity for a new kind of crowd
relationship, one not predicated on such rote exercises of theatrical
feedback. Our new era of “live” performance requires something not
exactly like cinema, not quite like television, but something more like
the internet. Traditional entertainers now feel in direct competition
with internet stars, who are preternaturally skilled at performing
one-sided conversations to unfeeling camera lenses, then riding waves of
online reactions that spin off in unexpected directions. The best
internet videos carry a frisson of intimacy and spontaneity; they seem
crafted not to please the crowd but to connect with one individual,
millions and millions of times.

YouTube and TikTok and Instagram, which have made sensations of people
shooting videos alone in their bedrooms, are the ideal platforms for a
pandemic that mandates private viewing. The must-see live show of the
summer is Verzuz, a [D.J. battle reimagined for
Instagram](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/arts/music/hip-hop-instagram-coronavirus.html),
in which players like Jill Scott and Erykah Badu take turns vibing to
their own greatest hits in a feat of synchronized isolation. It’s hard
to find that on television, even as the medium grasps for a more online
sensibility. A rash of reunion specials that assumed the aesthetics of
the Zoom grid had all the excitement of a staff meeting. The socially
distant conventions bore the emotional sterility of a telethon. But some
glimmers of interest have emerged.

Biden, hardly a master of new media technologies, nevertheless delivered
a convention speech directly to the camera that functioned as a more
intimate appeal, helping to underscore his bid to be presidential
empath. Watching professional comedians [fail to delight their
children](https://mashable.com/video/jimmy-fallon-home-monologue-heckled-daughters/)
has the indelible stamp of a viral video, one that keys into the online
mood better than any topical punchline. And last month, professional
athletes pulled off a remarkable show — [they stopped
playing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/sports/basketball/kenosha-nba-protests-players-boycott.html)
in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake. In a normal season,
with thousands of anxious paying fans looming above them, would they
have had the nerve to walk away? The strike worked both as protest and
performance because it was pitched not to the die-hards in the stands
but to the complacent television audience flipping through the channels.
Its message spoke directly to viewers at home: Get off the
couch.
