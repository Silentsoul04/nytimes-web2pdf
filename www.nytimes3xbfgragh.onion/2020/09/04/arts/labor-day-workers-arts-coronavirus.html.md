This Labor Day Weekend is unlike any other in recent memory: Broadway
and most of the city’s live performance venues have been closed for
nearly six months; museums have only recently begun to reopen; and
unemployment reached alarming levels in April.

The coronavirus pandemic has ravaged all parts of the economy, and
culture workers are among the hardest hit. Yet some have managed to keep
their jobs — and even thrive — while others are still struggling or have
pivoted to new roles. Now more than ever we wanted to reflect on those
people who have devoted their lives to the arts in some fashion. They’ve
soldiered on, amid the shutdown, to create some semblance of normalcy —
whether recommending a book, securing the grounds of an iconic cultural
institution or entertaining children. Here are some of their stories. —

**Phil LaDuca, 65, founder and creator of LaDuca Shoes in Manhattan**

Before the pandemic halted live performance, LaDuca Shoes was, in the
words of its creator, Phil LaDuca, “ready to explode on the scene.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His flexible character shoes, which grace — and save — the prized feet
of Rockettes as well as Broadway dancers and actors, were to be seen in
an array of productions this year, among them “The Eternals,” the Marvel
film whose release date has been moved to next year, and Andrew Lloyd
Webber’s “Cinderella” in London (pushed to next March). Also on the
horizon? “The Music Man,” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, on
Broadway.

Speaking recently from Los Angeles, where he lives with his wife, Fon,
his voice was a mix of wonderment and dismay. The day that Broadway
shows were shuttered, the couple were in New York for the opening of
[the new musical
“Six.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/theater/six-broadway.html)
He had designed the boots for the six actresses who play the ill-fated
wives of Henry
VIII.

“We were two hours away from the red carpet for opening night when I
received the call,” he said. “Fon and I were desperate to get out of New
York — we heard rumors that they were going to stop flights. I was doing
my Kurt Russell-Snake impersonation from ‘Escape From New York.’”

But while LaDuca did indeed escape, he hasn’t stopped working. In the
early days of the quarantine, LaDuca Shoes offered dance classes on
Instagram Live. “I always want to stay positive,” he said. “We did it
out of love for the community.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He added: “I went through a two-week period of funk and depression. And
then I said, no, we’re going to fight. Let’s not sit on the sidelines\!”

The classes ended in August — dancers, he said, have many more options
now — and the shop, on 45th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, has
reopened for fittings and pickups. This summer brought a significant
change at LaDuca Shoes: the LaDuca Palette, which features four new
colors to accommodate more skin tones. He said the inspiration came from
the Black Lives Matter movement, following the killing of George Floyd.
He said it made him reflect on his own white privilege.

LaDuca, who arrived in New York from the South Side of Chicago in 1979
with a pair of suitcases and $800 in his wallet, had no help in the
creation of his footwear and shop. The movement made him question “would
a Black kid from the South Side of Chicago have had the same
opportunities as me?” he said. “My answer is no. It made me realize I
wasn’t doing enough.”

And LaDuca’s aim is to do everything he can for dancers. He was one
himself. A year after he moved to New York, LaDuca was dancing on
Broadway in Agnes de Mille’s “Brigadoon.” Multiple injuries — his own —
led him to start LaDuca Shoes about 20 years
ago.

**James Fugate, 65, co-owner of Eso Won Books in Los Angeles**

It was the second week of the shutdown in March, and James Fugate, the
co-owner of Eso Won Books in the Leimert Park neighborhood of South Los
Angeles, was recovering from the flu. He thought it could have been
Covid-19, but he couldn’t get a test to confirm. Paul Coates, the
founder of Black Classic Press (and father of Ta-Nehisi), had organized
a Zoom conference for hundreds of Black booksellers and publishers to
talk about how they were going to keep their businesses alive in the
pandemic. Fugate joined, but turned off his audio so no one could hear
him coughing.

The event spurred a flurry of marketing for readers around the country
to support Black-owned bookstores, especially now that they couldn’t
shop in person. “Suddenly we started getting 25 orders a day, and that
really helped,” Fugate said in a masked interview in late August, in the
back office of his store on Degnan Boulevard.

But that boost was nothing compared to what was to come. On June 3, a
week and a half after the police killing of George Floyd, Fugate posted
a notice on Eso Won’s website, apologizing for having fallen behind on
filling the “overwhelming amount of orders” they’d received that week.
“We never anticipated anything like this,” he
wrote.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Soon they were receiving 400 orders in a single day; “I thought, it’s
going to take two days for me to get all those done,” he said. By the
next day, there were 1,200 more. “Oh, no, no, no,” he thought, “there’s
no way.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In Los Angeles, Black-owned bookstores are few and far between. Besides
Eso Won, Fugate said he knew of only two others: Malik Books in nearby
Baldwin Hills, and Reparations Club in Mid-City — both predominantly
African-American neighborhoods. “We’ve always had a cross-section of Los
Angeles come to our store,” he said. “Our growth is in part due to our
long record.”

Most foot traffic still consists of South Los Angeles locals, but lately
the majority of pickup orders are being placed by white customers from
all over the county. “There are some knuckleheads around here who are
upset,” he said. “They’re like, ‘Why are all these white people coming
here?’”

This Labor Day closes out a summer that saw the greatest period of
growth in the store’s 30-year history. Fugate has been a bookseller all
his life; he discovered his passion for the industry as a teenager, in
copies of Publishers Weekly borrowed from his local library in Detroit.
Now in his 60s, Fugate still processes and fulfills every single online
order himself. (“Sometime in June I said, ‘Stop answering the phones. We
cannot.’”)

But Fugate is grateful for the stress, and for his customers, who’ve by
and large been understanding of the inevitable delays, and even lost
transactions. He said he’s “disturbed” to hear other bookstore owners
complaining about the increased demand. “If you went from doing 20
orders a day to 200 orders a day,” he said, “just be happy.”

He also credits the American Booksellers Association for having
developed a bulk ordering program to help stores like Eso Won handle
higher sales volumes. Not all Black booksellers feel welcome “around all
those white people” in the A.B.A., he said. “But to me, you want to be
part of that bookselling
community.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since reopening Eso Won’s doors on June 1, Fugate and the bookshop’s
co-owner, Tom Hamilton, have been worried about the virus; but Hamilton
lets in only a few customers at a time, and asks that they wear masks
and use hand sanitizer before entering. Store hours are now noon to 4
p.m., Monday through Saturday, but the owners are there much longer:
from about 7 a.m. (sometimes earlier) until 5 p.m.

“Since the pandemic, it’s like nothing we’ve ever seen,” he said. “We
have so many books, but they all seem to be selling.

“I think that’s going to continue for some time,” he added, referring to
both the steady flux of orders in his inbox and the civil rights
movement that is at least partly fueling them. “This isn’t going to
stop.” *LAUREN

**Baseera Khan, 40, a Brooklyn-based artist who will be in residency at
the Kitchen this fall**

The artist Baseera Khan decided to film a cooking series for Instagram
called “Apocalypse Cooking” in the days after New York began sheltering
in place.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The videos were decidedly tongue-in-cheek, almost parodying Instagram as
a medium (“look at all my toilet paper,” “I still have cute nails”),
that provided viewers with easy-to-follow recipes.

“‘You don’t need fancy things to make fancy food’ was the theme,” Khan
said in a recent interview.

On March 26, Khan, who uses the pronoun “they,” did a live cooking
session on BRIC Brooklyn’s Instagram page. And then, that day, Khan
started feeling the symptoms of Covid-19. Immediately after filming for
BRIC, they started getting the chills.

“So April was dark for me,” Khan said, and much of their life came to a
halt.

Almost overnight, the four art shows that Khan — who uses a range of
materials to create installation, collage, sound and performance art —
had lined up for the rest of the year, including one at the [Atlanta
Contemporary](https://atlantacontemporary.org/press/atlanta-contemporary-announces-decade-by-baseera-khan)
in Georgia and another at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Ohio, were
canceled, postponed or left in limbo. And Khan said teaching positions
evaporated. (In addition to teaching at the summer Masters of Fine Arts
program at the School of Visual Arts, Khan also taught last year at
Virginia Commonwealth
University.)

With barely any money coming in and no health insurance, Khan resorted
to rationing food. “I’d wake up in the morning and have coffee and a
banana,” they said. “And then for a snack, I would have tea and an
apple. I would wait until around six to make a proper meal. Then I would
just go to sleep really early so I didn’t have to be hungry.”

Every day, Khan said they would also try to register for unemployment
benefits, calling the state labor department again and again with little
success.

It wasn’t until June 1 that they were finally able to register.

“It was all a really horrific experience,” Khan recalled. “But then, at
the same time, it felt familiar. Being an artist, you’re either
inundated with people and social activity or you’re very alone. So
there’s an oil-and-water to it. It did feel familiar to isolate
myself, to be honest.”

In the summer months, Khan’s circumstances slowly started turning
around.

This fall the New Orleans Museum of Art will screen a film of their
performance last year at the University of Albany. Titled “Braidrage,”
the work featured Khan scaling a rock- climbing wall that had been
constructed with resin casts of the artist’s body parts as the “rocks”
and a floor-to-ceiling thick black braid as the rope.

Khan also started selling prints of their work on Instagram. And, on
Sept. 8, Khan will begin [a six week residency at the
Kitchen](https://onscreen.thekitchen.org/baseera-khan) in New York,
where they will draw on their experiences in isolation and suffering
from Covid-19 to create artwork in the form of a TV show.

“I’m doing the best I can in terms of not worrying,” they said. “I don’t
know any other way.” *ALISHA HARIDASANI

**Elrige Shelton, 58, and Jervin Archibald, 46, chiefs of security at
Lincoln Center in Manhattan**

For the two chiefs of security at Lincoln Center for the Performing
Arts, one constant in their lives before the pandemic was daily
conversations with audience members as they patrolled the sprawling
16-acre campus.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Elrige Shelton, the late-shift security chief, remembers frequently
greeting an elderly man who was a regular at the summer dance sessions
known as Midsummer Night Swing in Damrosch Park. The man would always
show up with a much younger dance partner, he recalled.

Shelton’s counterpart during the daytime shift, Jervin Archibald, can
picture an older woman to whom he always said “good morning” when she
was on her way to work. She would greet him back: “Good morning, have a
good day\!” He never learned her name, but she was a constant who
disappeared when the pandemic shut down New York City in March.

There were the Lincoln Center patrons who would stop by just to chat
about the plays or operas that they planned to see.

“Sometimes people just need someone to talk to,” Archibald said. “And
you’re there to give them an ear.”

And then there were the harried ticket holders desperate to get
directions for a theater before showtime.

“I couldn’t walk 10 feet without someone asking me a question,” he said.
“Now no one wants to talk.”

The Metropolitan Opera House and Lincoln Center Theater haven’t hosted

Archibald, 46, who has worked in Lincoln Center’s security division for
more than half of his life, starts his shift at 7 a.m., calling roll and
getting his staff up to speed before heading out to patrol the campus.

Shelton, 58, who has worked there for more than 25 years, takes over at
3 p.m. and stays until 11 p.m., when — during typical times — audience
members are usually streaming out of the various theaters after a ballet
or concert or play.

Before the pandemic, Shelton took an hour-and-a-half bus ride from his
hometown in Pennsylvania to Manhattan; now, the bus no longer runs, so
he drives instead. In March, when the pandemic was first bearing down on
the city, he remembers that much of his job was making sure his security
staff felt safe.

“At first it was a little frightening,” he said. “We didn’t want the
staff to be fearful of coming to work.”

Then, he had to usher them through a difficult furlough period. As of
July 1, out of Lincoln Center’s roughly 400 full-time employees, about
30 percent were on furlough.

For months, Lincoln Center’s campus was entirely shut down. Neighbors
were no longer permitted to stroll around or sit by the fountain. The
emptiness was hard for Shelton, who was used to monitoring crowds of
several thousands before showtime and afterward.

Archibald, whose father worked as a Lincoln Center security guard for 14
years, drives in every day from his home in Brooklyn. Earlier this
summer, people who lived nearby told him that they were desperate for
the grounds to open again.

“I miss the patrons, I miss my co-workers,” he said. “I’m hoping for the
day that we can all come back.”

Then, in the middle of July, a partial reopening: The outdoor space
opened to the public. Instead of theatergoers circulating on the campus,
the outdoor areas are much more family oriented now, Archibald said.
There are people walking their dogs, children riding bikes, older
couples strolling through the plaza. For a couple of weeks, playlists
curated by Lincoln Center employees and institutions like New York City
Ballet played from the outdoor speakers on the
plazas.

While the chiefs are still missing their regular patrons and colleagues,
there are new people — and animals — who are becoming familiar
passers-by. Shelton said that he has gotten to know a huge German
shepherd named Mr. Pancake. He often sees an elderly couple who told him
how they miss the New York Philharmonic concerts.

“I consider myself a people person,” Shelton said. “So seeing the people
come back, it relaxes me.” *JULIA

**Caitlyn McCain, 23, artistic associate at New York City Children’s
Theater in Manhattan**

She has enjoyed the heroine’s spotlight in plays like Shakespeare’s
“Cymbeline” and “As You Like It.” But lately [Caitlyn
McCain](https://www.caitlynmccain.com/)’s most visible role is not
onstage but online, where she is simply Miss Caitlyn, the effervescent
host of Creative Clubhouse Stories at [New York City Children’s
Theater](https://nycchildrenstheater.org/).

“Covid definitely had me shift my mind-set a bit,” McCain said,
“although I’ve always seen acting and my work with young people in
applied theater and education as kind of equally important.”

When the city went into lockdown in March, McCain was appearing in
“[Five](https://nycchildrenstheater.org/education/multi-sensory-musical/),”
a touring musical from this company. She was also its temporary gala
associate, helping plan a fund-raiser that was soon canceled. Instead,
she began to work with Nicole Hogsett, director of marketing and
audience development, on “how we were pivoting our programming,” McCain
said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The result was [Creative
Clubhouse](https://nycchildrenstheater.org/shows-and-programs/creative-clubhouse/),
a web page of performances, reading recommendations, craft projects,
singalongs and games. McCain, who had been an education apprentice at
the theater while an undergraduate at New York University, proposed also
developing [Creative Clubhouse
Stories](https://nycchildrenstheater.org/shows-and-programs/creative-clubhouse-stories-caitlyn/),
a series of livestreaming book-based classes for ages 3 to
8.

“Covid-related things is how we started,” she said. “We chose books that
explored boredom, anger, anxiety — really big things that were probably
coming up for a lot of little ones.”

In the classes, Miss Caitlyn reads a picture book, introduces a related
activity and discusses the theme. After hearing “[Ravi’s
Roar](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/tom-percival/ravis-roar/),”
Tom Percival’s story about a boy who has trouble controlling his inner
(and here, literal) tiger, “one little human raises their hand and says,
‘It makes me angry that I can’t see my friends,’” McCain recalled. This
led to helpful reflections on how Ravi tamed his own beast.

Although the story series is on hiatus until October, Creative Clubhouse
features videos about each book. It also offers [Start the
Conversation](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/tom-percival/ravis-roar/),
a resource for helping children deal with challenging subjects. The
first installment, online now, covers race, racism and Black Lives
Matter. It includes McCain demonstrating a stress-reducing exercise, as
well as two videos she helped create: “You Matter,” for families of
color, centers on [Christian
Robinson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/talking-to-kids-about-racism.html)’s
children’s [book of the same
title](https://www.theartoffun.com/you-matter). “Black Lives Matter,”
for white families, focuses on [Anastasia
Higginbotham](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/16/well/family/children-books-how-to-be-upset.html)’s
“[Not My Idea: A Book About
Whiteness](https://www.dottirpress.com/not-my-idea).”

“I wasn’t really interested in exploring ‘We all matter’ and ‘We’re all
welcome here,’” McCain said. “That’s been done.” Instead, each video
addresses specific
concerns.

about a girl’s encounter with her enslaved ancestor and the founding of

McCain said her goal was to give audiences “the ability to adopt another

**Andy Carluccio, 22, lead developer at Liminal Entertainment
Technologies in Springfield, Va.**

At the beginning of March, Andy Carluccio assumed that when he graduated
from the University of Virginia he would pay his dues at a software
company and only later try to find a job that combined computer science
and theater, his twin passions.

“I thought the kind of work I’m doing now would be the kind of work I’d
maybe do in five years,” he said in an interview.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But by the end of the month — after the pandemic forced performing arts
venues across the country to shutter — Carluccio had been recruited by
his mentor [Eamonn Farrell](http://www.eamonnsgarden.com/) to contribute
his coding expertise to an online production of Caryl Churchill’s play
“Mad Forest” [at Bard
College](https://fishercenter.bard.edu/events/spring-mainstage-2020). He
was also plugging away at his undergraduate thesis.

Along with Farrell[,](http://www.eamonnsgarden.com/) who was working as
the show’s video designer, Carluccio was charged with reconciling the
creative vision of the production’s director, Ashley Tata, with the
capabilities of Zoom’s teleconferencing software. The [success of that
endeavor](https://fishercenter.bard.edu/events/the-making-of-mad-forest/)
in April (the [production was

in May [to critical
acclaim](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/24/theater/mad-forest-livestream.html))
and the skyrocketing demand for streaming content convinced Carluccio
that he didn’t need to complete an office job apprenticeship before
striking out on his own.

“I saw the writing on the wall that this was my chance to jump in and do
it now,” he said. “I figured I wasn’t even going to wait for the
conferral of my degree.” By May, Carluccio and his business partners,
Jonathan Kokotajlo and Nolan Jacobs-Walker, had Liminal Entertainment
Technology up and
running.

In the few short months since its founding, the company has facilitated
hundreds of livestreams for houses of worship, high school and
university groups, children’s theater organizations, Off Broadway
productions and arts festivals from Carluccio’s basement in Springfield,
Va. He is modest about his team’s role in these projects: “We think of
ourselves sort of like virtual plumbers, routing audio and video across
the internet from remote performers and technicians back to me to mix
into a final livestream for the audience to enjoy.”

During the spring it was not a foregone conclusion that theatermakers
would be able to successfully pivot from live performance to creating
compelling digital content. There were serious technical hurdles to
clear and relatively few resources that artists and producers could draw
on to make the switch. Some despaired, choosing to try to wait out the
public health crisis.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I created this company because I was saddened to see both community and
professional theaters cancel their shows and close their doors because
they felt the task of performing online was an insurmountable
challenge,” Carluccio explained. “I wanted to do whatever I could to
make sure these works could continue and perhaps even thrive during a
time when performing arts felt most needed but least accessible.”

The [rapid
evolution](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/theater/streaming-theater-experiments.html)
that online theater has undergone in just a few months has convinced the
young technologist that the hybrid art form is here to stay. “There are
things that can be done by weaving together collaborators and designers
over decentralized internet that I think has opened up design
possibilities and audience interactions and scale in a way that we’re
not going to want to turn off once we’re finally able to gather in
person again.” *PETER

New York dropped and the city gradually began to reopen. Outdoor shows
were cropping up in parks and on sidewalks, and Feehan was back onstage
— figuratively.

Now she is performing almost nightly, with clubs like [Stand Up
NY](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/arts/television/live-comedy-new-york.html)
(which holds performances in city parks) and an outdoor, pop-up comedy
show called [Take It
Outside](https://www.instagram.com/takeitoutsidecomedy/).

“While the conditions aren’t ideal, it’s better than nothing,” Feehan
said.

Microphones often need to be sanitized, if performers don’t have their
own, and there’s more pressure on the hosts to keep audiences engaged in
between sets. The reactions from the crowd have also changed.

Watching a comedy show in a dimly lit club, where the spotlight is on
the performer, allows the audience members more freedom to laugh at
jokes others in the room may find insensitive or vulgar, Feehan said.
“You laugh with abandon,” she said. “You don’t filter yourself.”

Remove the shroud of darkness, and people become more apprehensive.
“That’s a challenge that has existed with every outdoor show, whether
it’s during the day or at night,” Feehan
said.

The adjustments can be quite humbling for veteran comedians,
particularly those who have HBO and Netflix comedy specials under their
belts and are now “performing on Orchard Street while a garbage truck
goes by,” Feehan said.

Naturally, there is no shortage of coronavirus jokes. Feehan would like
to move on from them, but for now, that is all life has to offer. (One
for the road: “My dad is an essential customer at Home Depot,” Feehan
said. “He’s never leaving.”)

Though she has consistent shows lined up, Feehan is aware that winter
doesn’t bode too well for outdoor comedy. She hopes the city will find a
way to accommodate socially distanced, indoor performances — whatever
that may look like.

“The worst thing you can do is get rid of comedy shows,” she said,
calling the art form public therapy that encourages people to laugh at
the strange times we live in.

“Comics,” Feehan cheekily said, “are the frontline workers.” *SARA
