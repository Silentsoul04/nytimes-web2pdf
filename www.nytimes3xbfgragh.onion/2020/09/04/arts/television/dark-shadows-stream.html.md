# Comfort Viewing: 3 Reasons I Love ‘Dark Shadows’

It was camp; it was scary; it was one of the most popular daytime soaps
of its day. And for a gay teenager in the ’80s, it was perfect.

This story starts when “Dark Shadows” ends.

It was 1971, and my mother was set to have me by C-section. Her doctor
originally scheduled the procedure for April 1, but my mother balked at
having an April Fool’s baby. Instead, I greeted the world on April 2, a
chilly Friday in Cleveland.

It was also, much to my mother’s alarm, the day her beloved soap opera —
the supernatural drama “Dark Shadows” — aired its final episode on ABC.
As she tells it, she demanded I be delivered in the morning because she
sure as Hades wasn’t going to miss “Dark Shadows” that afternoon. She
got her wish.

I think about devotion these pandemic nights as I stay up late to watch
the original “Dark Shadows” [on the streaming service
Tubi](https://tubitv.com/series/4638/dark_shadows). When the series
debuted on June 27, 1966, it was unlike anything before or, I would say,
since. ABC [described](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYlrxfOf3S4) it
as “daytime television’s first continuing suspense drama,” which is like
saying Freddy Krueger is a grumpy guy in a cute sweater. Created by Dan
Curtis, “Dark Shadows” was a macabre and bonkers upside-down of [“Peyton
Place,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/07/19/arts/television/19karp.html)
a more conventional soap opera popular of its time. (Both were equally
white.)

The story arcs on “Dark Shadows” traversed the 18th, 19th and 20th
centuries, and centered on the old-money Collins family at the
Collinwood estate in small-town Collinsport, Maine. Wallace McBride, the
curator of the [Collinsport Historical
Society](http://www.collinsporthistoricalsociety.com/), a “Dark Shadows”
fan site, called the series “‘Star Trek’ for introverts.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If ‘Star Trek’ was about going new places and meeting new people, ‘Dark
Shadows’ is about staying inside,” McBride said in an interview last
month. “Characters travel to other dimensions without leaving the family
house. It’s very personal and inward focused.”

“Dark Shadows” was horror to the bone. Poor Collinsport was terrorized
by witchcraft, killer ghosts, lycanthropy and I don’t know how many
other evil doings. (Full disclosure: I’m not yet halfway through its
1,225 episodes.) In Episode 211, the show introduced the vampire
[Barnabas Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyYg2bD-U94), played
by the Shakespearean actor [Jonathan
Frid](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/04/20/arts/television/jonathan-frid-ghoulish-dark-shadows-star-dies-at-87.html).
Barnabas became a global phenomenon and unlikely sex symbol who helped
make the series one of the most popular soap operas of the era.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

With so many episodes, watching “Dark Shadows” is a herculean binge.
Already the series’s weird coolness has drawn me in like the undead to
the living. Why do I and so many horror fans have a connection with a
Gothic melodrama that’s so old it was pre-empted by the moon landing?

I called Kathryn Leigh Scott, who played the kindly waitress Maggie
Evans, to get her take. (Like many of the cast members, she also played
many other roles in this time-hopping series — it’s complicated.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The reason young kids used to run home from school to watch the show
was that it was pure escapism,” Scott explained. “No matter how much
kids picked on you in class, at least you weren’t bitten by a vampire.
It took you to another realm. Almost everything was about an outsider.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Ah. As a kid, I was what you’d call a triple-threat outsider. I grew up
in the ’80s as a gay teenager who didn’t know what gay was. I was a
geek. I was chubby. On summer afternoons as other kids played something
called sports, I was alone, devouring “All My Children,” “One Life to
Live,” “General Hospital” and sometimes [“The Edge of
Night”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZwTIaYAEOU) if the TV in my
room picked up the Akron station.

It’s now decades later, and I’m still kind of an outsider. I can’t
possibly be gayer. I’ve become a horror geek, and I’m still a little
chubby. And I still love watching old soap operas, especially “Dark
Shadows.” Here’s
why.

## It’s Old-School Scary

My love of horror has one source: my grandmother Blanca, my mother’s
mother, who kick-started my affection with classic [Universal monster
movies](https://universalmonsters.fandom.com/wiki/Universal_Monsters)
like “Dracula” and “Frankenstein.” The influence of these canonical
films pervades “Dark Shadows.” It’s in the contour of a mysterious
figure backlit by frenzied lighting strikes. It’s in the [ghostly theme
song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfWIQfqik3c), composed by [Bob
Cobert](https://variety.com/2020/music/obituaries-people-news/bob-cobert-dead-dies-dark-shadows-winds-of-war-1203512992/)
(and released on a best-selling “Dark Shadows”
[soundtrack](https://metv.com/stories/rip-bob-cobert-who-composed-the-eerie-music-of-dark-shadows)).
It’s in the show’s chilly mausoleums and creaky coffins.

As I watch, it’s as if the pioneering horror directors [James
Whale](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1957/05/30/archives/film-producer-dead-james-whale-falls-into-pool-directed.html)
and [Tod
Browning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1962/10/10/archives/tod-browning-80-exfilm-director-maker-of-chaney-and-lugosi-films.html)
were off-camera, beaming. Best of all, it’s as if my grandmother were,
too.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## It’s Queer

“Dark Shadows” is a soap opera. Everybody has secrets. But a sexual
vampire in Stonewall-era America is a *queer* secret. Barnabas was a
cursed man with forbidden attractions, which sounds a lot like what
queer people at the time were told their sad lives were about. Yet for
many people, especially young fans in the closet, Barnabas was as
familiar as he was frightening. (Like many actors on the show, Frid was
[known to be
gay](http://weareflagrant.com/eleven-dark-shadows-actors-probably-didnt-know-gay/),
but he never publicly came
out.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There are many queer delights in “Dark Shadows,” but two performances
stand out. The actor Louis Edmonds, [who came out later in
life](http://weareflagrant.com/eleven-dark-shadows-actors-probably-didnt-know-gay/),
gave a delicious performance as the irritable priss Roger Collins, who
wears cravats and turtlenecks and uses words like “preposterous.” (You
know the type.) And I swear the old New York City gay club Splash used
to play clips of Grayson Hall’s [camptastic
performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmfVofgcYT0) as Dr. Julia
Hoffman.

## It’s Butterfingered

“Dark Shadows” was taped live. As with theater, anything could and did
go wrong. That means the series is occasionally a Schadenfreude parade
of microphone shadows, flubbed lines and my favorite: exposed
stagehands. (The invaluable [“Dark Shadows”
wiki](https://darkshadows.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Shadows_Wiki) keeps track
of bloopers and continuity errors.) It’s fascinating to see how the TV
sausage was made when there was no stopping and no C.G.I. to clean up a
mess.

Many cast members came from theater, so they were used to recovering
after flubbing their lines. But my God, there’s nothing more thrilling
than seeing the great [Joan
Bennett](http://www.collinsporthistoricalsociety.com/2012/04/look-back-at-joan-bennett-week.html),
a treasure from Hollywood’s Golden Age, look at another actor with eyes
that whisper: I have no idea what to say next.

Sometimes “Dark Shadows” is messy and unpolished. That’s human, and
that’s a comfort.

*Watch it on*
[*Tubi*](https://tubitv.com/series/300004693/dark_shadows_the_beginning)
*or* [*Amazon Prime
Video*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0143JHTFW/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r)*.
If you want only the Barnabas part of the series, which is most of it,
look for “Dark Shadows”; pre-Barnabas episodes are found online as “Dark
Shadows: The Beginning.”*
