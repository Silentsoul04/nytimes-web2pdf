Jeffrey Toobin has written nine books, nearly all of them involving
intense research and reporting about the current moment. But on this
week's podcast, he talks about what made working on his latest,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/books/review/true-crimes-and-misdemeanors-jeffrey-toobin.html}{``True
Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Investigation of Donald Trump,''} such a
different experience.

``Trump makes it different,'' he says. ``The president is such an
anomalous figure in American history. His complete disregard for norms.
His constant lying. His inability or unwillingness to play by rules that
Democrats and Republicans have played by for certainly all of \emph{my}
conscious life. It makes everything about these last three and a half
years just feel different than anything I've ever covered, and anything
I've ever felt as a citizen. We've had conservative presidents, we've
had liberal presidents, but we've never had a president like Trump.''

Dayna Tortorici visits the podcast to talk about Elena Ferrante's new
novel,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/books/review/elena-ferrante-the-lying-life-of-adults.html}{``The
Lying Life of Adults,''} which she reviewed for us.

Tortorici discusses, among other subjects, the ``breathless, pile-on
style'' in stretches of Ferrante's work. ``The sentences have a real,
almost verbal logic to them. They're mimetic of how people who are
breathlessly describing an emotion do it. There's not clean sentences.
Even in less intense or emotionally volatile novels that she writes,
this reappears as a style. You have a person --- a woman --- who's
reflecting on a story, usually there's a frame narrative, and as she
gets closer to the bone of the emotion in the story, she sort of starts
to lose the control and the niceness of the sentences, and they start to
have this motion and momentum of their own.''

Also on this week's episode, Dwight Garner and Jennifer Szalai talk
about books they've recently reviewed. Pamela Paul is the host.

Here are the books discussed by the critics this week:
