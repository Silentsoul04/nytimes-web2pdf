The August jobs number comes with a quarter-million-job asterisk.

The headline payroll figure of 1.4 million new jobs includes nearly
240,000 workers hired temporarily to carry out the 2020 census. Most of
them will be laid off when census canvassing ends later this month ---
meaning next month's figure will also carry an asterisk, just in the
other direction.

Private-sector payrolls, which aren't affected by census hiring, rose by
one million, down from 1.5 million in July.

Unlike many of the other data quirks during the pandemic, the census
issue is a familiar one to economists. In 2010, census hiring added
\href{https://www.bls.gov/ces/tables/census-temporary-intermittent-workers-government-employment.htm}{410,000
jobs} to the May payroll figure, then shaved off roughly the same number
over the next two months. This year, census hiring came later than
usual, because of delays caused by the pandemic, and the total number of
jobs is smaller, in part because of an increased emphasis on getting
Americans to respond to the census online and by phone.
