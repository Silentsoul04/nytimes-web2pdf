One sign of how the economic crisis is evolving: Back in April, nearly
80 percent of unemployed workers reported being on temporary layoff or
furlough. In August, that figure had fallen to less than half.

That development is the result of a combination of good news and bad.
The good news is that as the economy gradually reopens, companies are
recalling furloughed employees. The
\href{https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t11.htm}{number of people
on temporary layoff} fell to 6.2 million in August, from a peak of 18.1
million in April.

But as companies reopen, many are discovering that with demand still
weak, they don't need --- or can't afford --- as many workers as before
the pandemic. Other companies aren't reopening at all. The number of
people reporting that their job losses were permanent rose to 3.4
million in August, from 2.9 million in July. (Another four million
people were unemployed for other reasons, such as entering the labor
force.)

The shift from temporary to permanent job losses is worrying, economists
say, because it suggests that companies don't foresee a quick rebound
--- and because it means jobless workers will have to start their job
searches from scratch.

``There's a fragility in the numbers,'' said Diane Swonk, chief
economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. ``There are cracks in
the underlying foundation.''
