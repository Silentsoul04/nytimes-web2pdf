In Ms. Reed’s writing for Newsweek, Vogue and other publications, her

Julia Reed, an irreverent, expansive chronicler of politics, food and
Southern life, died on Aug. 28 in Newport, R.I. She was 59.

The cause was cancer, said the historian Jon Meacham, a family friend.
She had been on vacation visiting friends.

In reporting for Newsweek, Vogue, The New York Times Magazine and other
publications, Ms. Reed covered presidents and their spouses, notably
both Bushes and the Clintons, along with powerful women, country music,
Southern rogues and Southern food. Her canvas was the foibles of power,
and even though (or perhaps because) she was the daughter of a Nixon-era
Republican grandee, she was cleareyed about the vices and virtues of
both parties.

In her profile of Laura Bush in the run-up to the 2000 election, Ms.
Reed wrote of the night early in her husband’s political career when
Mrs. Bush told him a speech he had delivered wasn’t very good. “He drove
into the garage wall,” Ms. Reed reported. “They’ve both grown a lot
since then.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a statement to The New York Times, the Bushes wrote: “Julia was a
longtime friend of ours. We loved to be with her because she was
charming, observant, funny and irreverent. We’ll miss listening to her
stories and laughing with her.”

Al Gore, Mr. Bush’s opponent in the 2000 election, also sent a
statement. “She was an original,” he said, “one of the last who
combined, among other things that seem to have passed, a deep knowledge
and love of the self-conscious South and a command of the newsrooms in
which she worked.”

Deeply imprinted by the Mississippi Delta traditions she grew up with,
Ms. Reed was as well known for her entertaining as her journalism. In
[one of her many food
columns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/11/10/magazine/the-morning-after.html)for
The New York Times Magazine, she described a New Year’s Eve party that
had gone off the rails. There was a fistfight, more than one bathroom
dalliance, the unmasking of an arms dealer, a fainting, a fire and more
— all of which she missed but heard about secondhand by phone when she
awoke with a hangover the next day.

“I have always said that danger — or at least the possibility of it — is
a crucial element of any good party,” she wrote. “Parties thrive on
secrets that are made or told, alliances formed, dalliances done,
someone striking a match in someone else’s inappropriate heart.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Ms. Reed earned her first byline at 19, when she was a sophomore at
Georgetown University in Washington and a part-time library assistant
and phone answerer, as she put it, at Newsweek, a job she had held since
she was a student at Madeira, an all-girls boarding school in Virginia.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the school’s headmistress, Jean Harris, murdered her lover, Dr.
Herman Tarnower, the celebrity doctor and creator of the Scarsdale Diet,
Newsweek’s Washington bureau chief sent Ms. Reed to get the Madeira
angle. [As Ms. Reed
wrote](https://gardenandgun.com/articles/the-high-the-low-good-country-bad-behavior/),
he woke her up with an order to head back to her old school. When she
wondered why, he barked, “You idiot, your headmistress just shot the
diet doctor\!”

Ms. Reed liked to say she was sorry the doctor had to give his life in
service to her career as a journalist.

Julia Evans Reed was born on Sept. 11, 1960, in Greenville, Miss. Her
mother, Judy (Brooks) Reed, came from a prominent Nashville family in
the Belle Meade neighborhood there. Her father, Clarke Reed, was a
businessman and Republican power broker who traveled frequently —
“Saving the free world,” [he liked to tell his
daughter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/08/30/us/republicans-convention-new-york-apple-s-almanac-father-southern-strategy-76-here.html)when
she asked what he was up to — and entertained enthusiastically. Ms. Reed
grew up cooking for William F. Buckley Jr. and George and Barbara Bush,
among others.

Greenville was a place, as she wrote in “Ham Biscuits, Hostess Gowns,
and Other Southern Specialties: An Entertaining Life With Recipes,”
“where cooking was of paramount importance. We give food away as
presents and peace offerings, and sometimes because it is just so
incredibly good we have to share it. We tote it to people in times of
grief (when my grandparents were killed in a car wreck, the first thing
my mother told me to do as she ran out the door was to empty the
refrigerator); we use it to say bon voyage or welcome
back.”

Ms. Reed was the author of eight books, many of them collections of her
essays on food and the good life.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Meacham described her as a foreign correspondent in her own land,
“filing dispatches about the sacred and the profane.”

Colleagues at Vogue recalled her as both larger than life and free from
hubris — a rare combination at 350 Madison Avenue, Condé Nast’s old
headquarters, where egos roamed free.

“We were both children of the South, but from opposite ends of the
spectrum,” said André Leon Talley, the longtime Vogue editor. “She was
like a brassy marquise at Versailles, and at the same time a big hunky
dose of Babe Paley, Nancy Mitford, Rosalind Russell and Tallulah
Bankhead, with that cognac whiskey voice.”

In the wake of her death, many tried to describe her distinctive
baritone. “She sounded like Barbara Stanwyck in ‘Meet John Doe,’ if
Stanwyck was from the Mississippi Delta,” Hilton Als of The New Yorker
wrote [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEez249B_9t/).

Mr. Talley also recounted the story of Ms. Reed’s aborted marriage to a
charming Australian foreign correspondent. She canceled the wedding, a
full-on Southern affair with nearly 1,000 guests, but the couple went on
their honeymoon anyway — it was paid for, after all — ending up at the
Ritz in Paris, where they met Mr. Talley, and holding court in the bar
until the early hours of the morning, with characters as various as
Madonna’s bodyguards, Kate Moss, Johnny Depp and Arlene Dahl.

“It was couture week, so everybody was there,” Mr. Talley explained.

Writing about that night six years later [in
Vogue](https://archive.vogue.com/article/1996/6/1/dis-engaged), Ms. Reed
called it “one of the most memorable evenings of my life.”

Ms. Reed’s marriage to John Pearce, a New Orleans lawyer [with whom she
renovated a house in the garden
district](https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/house-interiors/g254/greek-revival-interiors-julia-reed/?slide=1)
there, ended in divorce in 2016. She is survived by her parents and a
brother, Clarke Reed Jr. Another brother, Reynolds Crews Reed, died in
2019.

Ms. Reed was a sought-after speaker, by all accounts a born entertainer
— energetic, savvy and hilarious. In 2013, she took over the [Delta
Hot Tamale
Festival](https://www.mainstreetgreenville.com/delta-hot-tamale-festival.html)
in Greenville, turning a small local fair into three-day national
literary and culinary extravaganza to benefit her hometown. The event
concluded with a raucous barbecue on a sandbar.

Last year, Ms. Reed opened an online home goods store, [Reed Smythe &
Company](https://www.reedsmythe.com), with her friend Keith Smythe
Meacham. The store sells pieces inspired by Ms. Reed’s own taste —
bronze drawer pulls shaped like the head of her beagle, Henry; porcelain
plates; engraved note cards — many of which are made by Southern
artisans. Last year Mississippi’s arts commission named Ms. Reed a
cultural ambassador to the state. A few months ago she also opened a
bookstore, Brown Water Books, in downtown Greenville.

Since 2011, Ms. Reed [had been a
columnist](https://gardenandgun.com/feature/the-indelible-voice-of-julia-reed/)at
Garden & Gun. H[er last
piece](https://gardenandgun.com/articles/my-home-is-my-animal-kingdom/),
posted last week, was about bedbugs and other vermin.

David DiBenedetto, the magazine’s editor, explained what it was like
working with Ms. Reed. “We had standard deadlines and Julia’s deadline,”
he wrote in an email. “And her excuses for filing late were often as
entertaining as the actual columns or features themselves.”

On one particularly hairy occasion, he said, it was really down to the
wire. The editors were sending pages to the printer when Mr. DiBenedetto
received an email from Ms. Reed. It read: “Just landed in Dallas this
second. Polished up at least 1,500 words before computer ran out of
juice. Gonna send that when I get to the hotel and will finish the rest
tonight after dinner with Laura Bush. She doesn’t drink so it will
happen.”

“The piece was fabulous, as always,” he said, adding, “We were all
voyeurs, in a way, her readers and editors, to a life so much larger —
and more fun — than our own.”
