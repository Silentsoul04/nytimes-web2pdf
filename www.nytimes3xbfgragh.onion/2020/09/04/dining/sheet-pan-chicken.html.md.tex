Meal}\label{roast-chicken-and-plums-make-the-sweetest-sheet-pan-meal}}

Easy, festive, and bursting with spiced, seasonal fruit, this late
summer dinner should be made before plum season ends.

If there's ever been a year in need of sweetening, it's this one. So
I've been looking forward to Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, more
avidly than usual.

Like many Jews, my family will dip apples and challah in honey, and
bring sweet fruit-laden dishes to the table as a harbinger of the year
to come. The sweeter its entry, tradition suggests, the sweeter it shall
continue. As far as religious rituals go, it's a pretty pleasant one to
follow.

Because the holiday usually falls during plum season, the juicy stone
fruit is a natural on the menu. Marian Burros's gloriously buttery
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/3783-original-plum-torte}{plum
torte} has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe-variations.html}{an
entrenched favorite} ever since
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1983/09/21/garden/food-notes-the-food-at-59th-and-lex.html}{the
recipe came out in 1983}.

Plums can shine in main dishes as well. Here, I've layered them in a
sheet pan with chicken and sliced red onions, which caramelize in all
those plummy juices.

If you use a mix of red, purple and yellow plums, you'll make a
particularly colorful meal that's perfect for the holiday.

And, like so many sheet-pan dinners, it's mostly fuss-free. You do need
to season the chicken a few hours ahead, but your actual hands-on time
is minimal. Marinating gives the bird a chance to absorb the earthy
flavors of toasted fennel seeds and allspice, along with garlic, lemon
zest and a fiery jolt of red-pepper flakes.

I also add a drizzle of honey to the pan, and not just because of Rosh
Hashana. Plum skins are notoriously tannic, and a little honey smooths
things out. The combination of honey and spices gives the plums a
chutney-like appeal, while the onions add a silky texture. Even better,
as everything roasts, the plums absorb some of the savory chicken
drippings, melting into a tangy, bright sauce that's rich with schmaltz.

One thing to keep in mind when shopping is that rock-hard plums may not
release enough liquid to make a sauce. If you can't get ripe, soft plums
nearly bursting with juice, substitute another stone fruit. Peaches,
nectarines and pluots will all work, though since these tend to be
sweeter than plums, you might need a squeeze of lemon at the end.

Just don't add too much acid. Sweetness is the very point here ---
whether you're celebrating Rosh Hashana or looking for an easy, seasonal
sheet-pan chicken recipe that's both richly hued and more festive than
most.

With this festive Rosh Hashana dish, it's nice to have an equally
festive wine. My inclination with the plums is to pick a red wine. A
juicy pinot noir would be ideal, as long as the richness is balanced by
sufficient acidity. If you wanted something a little more structured,
you could try a Pomerol or a good merlot. Plenty of other reds would
work, whether a cru Beaujolais, nebbiolo with some age, cabernet franc
from the Loire or a Rioja. If you prefer a white, I would opt for a
chenin blanc from the Loire Valley or California, or maybe a white
St.-Joseph from the Rhône. A rich Austrian riesling would also be good.
