“I like the food here,” my dad would unfailingly say to me as he pulled
open the aluminum-framed, oil-smudged glass door at [Sun Lok
Kee](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/10/09/dining/25-and-under-cantonese-old-timer-changes-boroughs-not-bean-sauce.html),
a Mott Street stalwart that served beef chow fun and other Cantonese
classics at any hour of the day until it burned down in 2002. “It has
that nice smoky flavor.” My family moved to New York in the early ’80s,
when I was 4 years old, and those stir-fries from Sun Lok Kee, with
their savory char and smoky aroma, are among my first and fondest taste
memories.

Wok hei is the Cantonese name for that aroma (literally “wok energy” or
“wok breath”). My dad has always been a wok hei fiend, first scouring
the streets of Chinatown and later the suburbs of Boston for smoky clams
in black bean sauce, fire-kissed stir-fried greens, beef chow fun that
almost tastes grilled, or noodles that are singed just right.

As a professional cook and recipe developer, I’ve spent a good 15 years
attempting to identify the elements that go into creating wok hei, so
that I might capture that flavor in a basic home kitchen. Last year, as
I researched and tested for a book on wok cooking, I finally got there.
True wok hei flavor right in my own kitchen.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Of course, some folks would say wok hei is incongruous with home
cooking. “That smoky flavor” is the kind of matter-of-fact flourish-free
description my dad excels at, but it’s by no means the agreed-upon
definition. In her 2004 book, “The Breath of a Wok,” Grace Young
identifies wok hei as “when a wok breathes energy into a stir-fry,
giving foods a unique concentrated flavor and aroma.” In “The Chinese
Kitchen,” Eileen Yin-Fey Lo says it’s when “the proper amount of fire is
made to curl up around the bowl of the wok to cook foods precisely to
that point of optimum flavor.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When I asked my friends Steph Li and Chris Thomas, the couple in
Shenzhen, China, behind the popular YouTube channel [Chinese Cooking
Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54SLBnD5k5U3Q6N__UjbAw),
their response jumped between descriptive and evocative. “Wok hei is
this ethereal thing,” Steph said. It’s “that taste of the first bite of
a hot restaurant stir-fry. It’s got that taste of the restaurant oil,
the slightly deeper restaurant browning, the heavier restaurant
seasoning.

“Seeing home cooks outside of China being obsessed about wok hei has
always been kind of bewildering to me,” she added.

She has a point. Most folks in China don’t have restaurant-style
equipment at home, and even the concept of wok hei is not widely known
outside of the Cantonese regions of Southeastern China. But it is
perhaps because most Chinese food in America has its earliest roots in
Cantonese cuisine that American diners so strongly associate good
Chinese food with that flavor. (According to Andrew Smith’s “Eating
History,” there were five Chinese restaurants in San Francisco by 1850,
started by Cantonese immigrants who arrived during the Gold Rush.)

But what *is* the flavor? Where does it come from? What’s so different
about cooking in a restaurant? In my own testing, I’ve managed to narrow
it down to a few key elements.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Most of these traits are intrinsic to woks, particularly those made of
carbon steel, a material that, like cast iron, can be seasoned to a
jet-black, nonstick coating and unlike cast iron, can be cast or
hammered thin and light enough to make tossing food a possibility.

When I was a test cook at Cook’s Illustrated, I conducted a number of
blind taste tests, stir-frying noodles, beef and vegetables in
Western-style skillets (the magazine’s recommended method at the time)
side by side with a nonstick wok, and my own well-seasoned carbon steel
wok. The carbon steel wok unanimously won those taste tests, producing
flavors that tasters described as “grilled” or “caramelized.”

As Lan Lam has written in a [more recent article from Cook’s
Illustrated](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/articles/2189-the-science-of-stir-frying-in-a-wok),
this has to do with the chemical interactions between the food and the
layers of polymerized oils on the surface of a seasoned wok. It’s also
tied to the unique action of stir-frying in a wok. “Modernist Cuisine”
describes how when a morsel is tossed up through the heavy cloud of
steam that forms above a hot wok, that steam condenses on the surface of
the food, a process that “deposits formidable amounts of latent energy
that rapidly heats the food.” It then drops back down onto the hot
surface of the wok where that surface moisture is re-vaporized, and the
cycle repeats. A wok allows you to constantly toss food through its own
vapors, speeding up its cooking, which concentrates flavor and promotes
the development of new flavor compounds through the Maillard reaction
better than a flat skillet can.

The wide rim of a wok factors into another key element of wok hei. In
her 2010 book, “Stir-Frying to Sky’s Edge,” Ms. Young emphasizes the
importance of adding soy sauce and other liquids around the perimeter of
the wok, so as not to decrease the temperature of the searing zone in
the center, which can cause meat and vegetables to steam rather than
sizzle. This advice is common among Chinese chefs and cookbook authors.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

But as I watched Sichuan chef Wang Gang splash soy sauce around the
perimeter of a wok full of [home-style egg fried rice on his YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvE5cYNXufY), I noticed
something: how rapidly it sizzles and sputters. I was reminded of a
Mexican cooking technique I learned from the late chef [David
Sterling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/04/23/dining/23mini.html)
at his home in the Yucatán: As he tipped fresh salsa into a ripping-hot
saucepan, it superheated in an instantaneous steamy sputter, giving it a
richer color and smoky undertones. Could this concept of a seared sauce
also be a factor in wok hei flavor?

To test this, I made two identical batches of lo mein, changing only the
manner in which I finished them. For the first, I finished by splashing
two tablespoons of soy sauce around the perimeter of the wok, while
simultaneously splashing two tablespoons of water into the center of the
wok. For the second, I swapped the water and soy sauce. (Adding water to
the test ensured that both batches would experience the same cool-down
effect of liquid added directly to the center, while only one would
develop seared soy sauce flavors.)

The difference was stark. Adding soy sauce to the center of the wok left
the noodles with a raw soy sauce flavor, while drizzling it around the
hot edges of the wok created smoky flavors reminiscent of grilled meat.
I’ve since found that adding a small splash of oil to the perimeter of
the wok before adding the soy sauce will prevent the soy sauce from
ending up caked onto the side of the wok.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Given that it’s the shape of a wok that allows for tossing through steam
and searing sauces, is there any hope for capturing wok hei in a Western
skillet? Fortunately, yes there is, and it has to do with the final,
most important contributor to wok hei: burnt oil.

Watch a Cantonese restaurant chef in action and you’ll see that, just as
the author Ms. Lo described, flames will lick up the back of the wok,
sometimes even spreading down into the wok itself. This happens because
as food gets tossed through the hot zone behind the wok, tiny droplets
of aerosolized oil will ignite and flare up. That singed oil then leaves
small, sooty deposits on the food as it gets tossed through the smoke.
It’s this flavor — the same flavor that develops as a hamburger drips
fat onto red hot coals below it — that I most strongly associate with
wok hei.

The problem is that Cantonese restaurant wok ranges, which can output
200,000 B.T.U.s per hour or more, are an order of magnitude more
powerful than even the most powerful home burner. It’s that massive jet
of flame that makes igniting vaporized fat possible, but I’ve found a
reasonable workaround.

If I can’t bring my food to the flame, why not bring the flame to my
food? A camping-style fuel tank, along with a brazing head (such as the
Iwatani Pro butane torch head or [Bernzomatic
TS8000](https://www.bernzomatic.com/Products/Hand-Torches/Instant-On-Off/TS8000)
propane torch head) that I point directly at the food inside a wok for a
few brief moments as I toss, can lend that vaporized oil flavor.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In practice, this technique, which my colleagues at Serious Eats
independently arrived at and cleverly coined “torch hei,” is tricky.
Even with two hands, stir-frying takes practice. To simplify things,
I’ve found that transferring the stir-fried food to a rimmed baking
sheet, spreading it in a single layer, and giving it a few leisurely
passes with the torch before returning it to the wok for final saucing
and garnishing is a simple and effective
workaround.

The torch hei method combined with a skillet is good enough to capture
some of the magic of a great Cantonese restaurant. When I add a carbon
steel wok and some seared soy sauce to the mix, I can almost hear my dad
pushing open my kitchen door as he says to me, “I like the food here.”
