Twenty-year-old Janan Moein vaped his first pen a year ago. By late
fall, he was blowing through several THC-laced cartridges a week — more,
he said, than most people can handle.

Then in early December, he found himself in the emergency room of Sharp
Grossmont Hospital in San Diego with a collapsed lung and a diagnosis of
[vaping-related lung
illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/07/health/vaping-lung-illness.html).
His hospital stay plunged him into a medically induced coma, forced him
onto a breathing machine and stripped nearly 50 pounds off his
6-foot-1-inch frame in just two weeks.

At one point, Mr. Moein said, his doctors gave him a 5 percent chance of
survival. He resolved that the wax pen he had vaped before his
hospitalization would be his last.

When he contracted a mild case of Covid-19 during a family barbecue
three months ago, he knew he had quit not a moment too soon. “If I had
caught Covid-19 within the week before I got really ill, I probably
would have died,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Since the start of the pandemic, experts have
[warned](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/smoking-and-covid-19)
that the coronavirus — a respiratory pathogen — [most likely capitalizes
on the scarred lungs of smokers and
vapers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/health/coronavirus-smoking-vaping-risks.html).
Doctors and researchers are now starting to pinpoint the ways in which
smoking and vaping seem to enhance the virus’s ability to spread from
person to person, infiltrate the lungs and spark some of Covid-19’s
worst symptoms.

“I have no doubt in saying that smoking and vaping could put people at
increased risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19,” said Dr. Stephanie
Lovinsky-Desir, a pediatric pulmonologist at Columbia University. “It is
quite clear that smoking and vaping are bad for the lungs, and the
predominant symptoms of Covid are respiratory. Those two things are
going to be bad in combination.”

Last year’s vaping crisis, during which thousands of people like Mr.
Moein were sickened and hospitalized with severe lung and respiratory
illnesses, underscored the hazards of many e-cigarette and vaping
products, [especially illicitly sold marijuana-based
vapes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/08/health/vaping-illness-cdc.html).

But while several studies have found that
[smoking](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032) can [more
than double a person’s
risk](https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/22/9/1653/5835834) of [severe
Covid-19
symptoms](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\(20\)30338-4/fulltext),
the data on the relationship between vaping and Covid-19 are only
beginning to emerge. A team of researchers recently reported that young
adults who vape are [five times more
likely](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X20303992)

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Much of what underlies the relationship between smoking, vaping and the
coronavirus remains unclear. Doctors aren’t sure why vaping makes some
people seriously sick, but seems to spare others. And Mr. Moein’s
unexpectedly mild encounter with the coronavirus remains mysterious as
well.

These and other lingering questions have made the risks of smoking and
vaping during the pandemic tough to
communicate.

James Ippolito, a 26-year-old Army veteran who lives in Hingham, Mass.,
has been hooked on vaping nicotine for about six years. “I vape every
day, all day long,” Mr. Ippolito said.

The looming threat of the virus doesn’t intimidate him. “I hate to say
it, but if I got the virus, I would still be vaping — I wouldn’t even
think it was related,” he said.

Such stubbornness troubles experts, who pointed out that Covid is hardly
the first disease to hit smokers and vapers harder.

“Lungs aren’t designed to regularly breathe in smoke and vape,” said Dr.
Drew Harris, a pulmonologist at UVA Health in Virginia. These products,
he added, “do just about everything bad you can think of.”

About [34 million adults smoke
cigarettes](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/ss/ss6812a1.htm?s_cid=ss6812a1_w)
in the United States, many of them from communities of color and low
socioeconomic status — groups already known to be more vulnerable to the
virus. And more than 5 million middle and high school students recently
[reported using
vapes](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/ss/ss6812a1.htm?s_cid=ss6812a1_w).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The active contents of cigarettes and vapes vary immensely, ranging from
nicotine to THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana. But many
experts are more concerned about the other ingredients that tend to
accompany them: additives like heavy metals and [vitamin E
acetate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/08/health/vaping-illness-cdc.html),
which bathe the lung in toxins and ultrafine particles that can poison
or pulverize delicate tissues.

Decades of research have unmasked smoking’s ability to [put the immune
system on the
fritz](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/tobacco-and-cancer/health-risks-of-smoking-tobacco.html).
The punch of harmful chemicals packed into each puff is thought to
[discombobulate the system of checks and
balances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5352117/) needed
to direct disease-fighting cells and molecules toward harmful invaders
like germs, while waylaying any misguided attacks on healthy tissues.

A body hamstrung by a smoking habit can [struggle to rouse a sufficient
defense against viruses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30789425/) —
but has little trouble turning its arsenal of weapons inward.
Eventually, deteriorating lungs can become chronically inflamed and
awash with mucus, narrowing the airways and stymieing the flow of oxygen
into the blood. Certain patients may end up with lungs pockmarked by
scar tissue, further impeding the movement of air.

Dr. Lovinsky-Desir describes the internal architecture of these tissues
as bunches of gas-filled grapes, enmeshed in a network of blood vessels.
“Chronic smoking destroys those grapes,” she said. “They become saggy
and floppy.”

Smoke can also compromise little hairlike structures known as cilia that
boot toxins and microbes out of the airways, making it easier for
pathogens to set up shop in the
lungs.

Should a virus then enter the mix, Dr. Lovinsky-Desir said, “it will
cause more destruction,” clogging the already damaged grapes with a glut
of cellular debris. Years of data have borne out these relationships.
Smokers who catch the flu, for instance, are [more likely than
nonsmokers to wind up in the
hospital](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30789425/).

Less is known about vaping, a relative newcomer. But [similar
trends](https://www.bmj.com/content/366/bmj.l5275) have [been
noted](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/128531) for e-cigarettes and
vape pens. Several studies have shown that [vaping makes
mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25651083/) more vulnerable to
[bacteria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804311/) and viruses, and
sends surges of inflammation throughout the body,[beyond the boundaries
of the lungs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29384700/).

Mr. Moein was one of thousands who last year fell prey to a disease
called e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury, or Evali. Many
Evali patients had vaped products containing a sticky substance called
vitamin E acetate, which has been found in the branded Dr. Zodiak
cartridges Mr. Moein preferred.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Mr. Moein still recalls his hospital stay in vivid detail.

“My lips were blue,” he said. “They had to tape my eyes shut. I was
hallucinating the entire time that the nurses were trying to kill me,
that the walls were made of human skin. It was a really bad situation.”

Nearly a year later, Mr. Moein, a towering athlete who played
competitive sports in high school, said he was now once again “very
healthy.”

But Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist and vaping expert at
University of California San Diego and one of Mr. Moein’s doctors, said
experts were still teasing apart the potential long-term effects of
vaping, even brushes briefer than his.

“Just because he feels 100 percent recovered doesn’t mean his lung
function returned to 100 percent,” she
said.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

After [peaking last
September](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/health/vaping-illness-tracker.html),
emergency department visits linked to Evali plummeted. But the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [has not updated their counts since
February](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#latest-outbreak-information),
leaving experts worried that concerns over vaping have fallen to the
wayside. “This has not gone away from patients,” said Michelle Eakin, a
pulmonary disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Crotty Alexander noted that she and other researchers have struggled
to follow up on many of last year’s Evali cases, paradoxically thanks to
a pandemic that might hit some of these patients especially hard.

Early evidence hints that the virus may have an easier time breaking
into the bodies of smokers and vapers. Smoking appears to [alter the
surfaces](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v1?versioned=true)
of [certain
cells](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107v3),
prompting them to [coat themselves with more of a molecule called
ACE-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7301735/) — the
protein the coronavirus uses to break into its targets.

“If you have higher expression, you’re going to have more virus entering
cells,” Dr. Crotty Alexander said. “I’m now seeing the same sort of data
come out on the vaping side.”

That pattern, layered on top of the ways in which vaping weakens the
lungs, may help explain why a recent survey of more than 4,000 people
ages 13 to 24 found that vaping was [strongly linked to catching the
coronavirus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X20303992).
But Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a pediatrics researcher at Stanford
University and an author on the study, said that there was probably more
than biology at play.

People who vape often do it socially, sharing spaces and equipment. And
vaping, like smoking, involves a lot of hand-to-mouth movement,
providing germs an easy path into the airway, Dr. Eakin said. “And if
you’re smoking or vaping,” she said, “you’re not wearing a mask.”

Still unclear are the long-term consequences of Covid’s effects on those
who smoked or vaped. Accumulating evidence suggests that the coronavirus
can wreak havoc on blood vessels, seeding clots that suffocate and warp
tissues, including the lungs — most likely making any smoking or vaping
after Covid even more dangerous than before.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“Some of these patients will have permanent issues,” said Dr. Anne
Melzer, a pulmonologist at the University of Minnesota.

Arlie Frahmann, a longtime smoker who picked up her first cigarette at
the age of 9, hesitated to give up cigarettes when the coronavirus first
infiltrated her community in Damariscotta, Maine, this spring. “The last
thing I wanted was to be stressed out during quarantine,” she said.

As of this week, though, Ms. Frahmann is eager to quit. She started a
new job at a bakery, where she will have to interact with strangers.

“It was one thing to explain it away to myself when I wasn’t going into
public at all,” she said of her smoking. “But now I can’t justify it.”

A few early reports suggest that [some
people](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.20142661v1)
[may be shelving their
cigarettes](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53403610) or vapes. As
schools reopen for in-person learning, though, it might become easy to
relapse.

And Dr. Lovinsky-Desir worries that the stressors brought on by the
pandemic may be pushing some people to smoke or vape even more.

Mr. Moein recalls brushing off warnings from his father, who used to
send him articles about the dangers of vaping.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I used to tell him, ‘You’re out of touch, vaping is safer,’” he said.
“At one point, I was getting so many articles that I blocked his
number.”

But last year’s events flipped Mr. Moein’s worldview. The pandemic, he
said, is another reminder that the risks of vaping simply aren’t worth
it: “There’s no way in hell that vaping helps Covid-19.”
