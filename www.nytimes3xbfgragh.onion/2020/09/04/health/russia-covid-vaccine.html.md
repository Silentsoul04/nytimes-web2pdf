<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Friday, a team of Russian scientists
[published](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31866-3/fulltext)
the first report on their [Covid-19
vaccine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/health/9-drug-companies-pledge-coronavirus-vaccine.html),
which had been roundly criticized because of President Vladimir Putin’s
decision last month to approve it before clinical trials had proved it
safe and effective.

In a small group of volunteers, the scientists found that the vaccine
produced a modest level of antibodies against the coronavirus, while
causing only mild side effects. The research has not yet shown, however,
whether people who are vaccinated are less likely to become infected
than those who are not.

In August, Mr. Putin
[announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine-approval.html)
with great fanfare that the vaccine — called [Sputnik
V](https://sputnikvaccine.com/) — “works effectively enough” to be
approved. He declared its approval to be a “very important step for our
country, and generally for the whole world.”

But vaccine developers
[denounced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/health/russia-covid-19-vaccine-safety.html)
the decision, observing that no data had been published on the vaccine.
In addition, the critics pointed out, the Russian scientists had yet to
run a large trial of tens of thousands of people, which is required to
demonstrate that a vaccine works.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The new paper, published in the Lancet, contains the first batch of
public data from Sputnik V’s clinical trials. Independent scientists
were impressed by the rigor of the work.

“The science looks like it was done impeccably well,” said Naor Bar-Zeev
of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who is the
co-author of a
[commentary](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31867-5/fulltext)
on the new paper. Still, he cautioned that no one will know if Sputnik V
is safe and effective until the larger trials are completed.

“We should welcome a Russian vaccine if it’s successful, and we should
welcome other vaccines if they’re successful,” Dr. Bar-Zeev said. “But
they should all be equally rigorously evaluated.”

Researchers at the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow used a design
for the vaccine that they had previously developed and tested for MERS,
a disease caused by another coronavirus.

The Sputnik V vaccine stimulates the immune system by coaxing a person’s
cells to make a protein normally found on the coronavirus that causes
Covid-19. The researchers loaded the gene for this viral protein into a
second virus, called an adenovirus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When injected into the arm, the adenovirus slips into muscle cells. It
has been genetically engineered so that it cannot make copies of itself
or cause illness. But once it delivers the coronavirus gene into a cell,
the cell starts making the
protein.

Similar adenovirus-based vaccines [are also being
tested](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
by several other teams, including AstraZeneca, CanSinoBio and Johnson &
Johnson.

Each team is testing a different strain of adenovirus. Unlike the rest,
the Russian team is combining two adenoviruses into one vaccine. For
their initial clinical trial, the Gamaleya researchers gave volunteers
an initial shot of an adenovirus called Ad26, and then, three weeks
later, a shot of one known as Ad5.

In the Lancet paper, the researchers said that they tested the vaccine
on hamsters and monkeys. They claimed the animals were protected against
the coronavirus without any harmful side effects but did not present any
data about these studies in their new paper.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

The trial they ran on human volunteers was what’s known as a Phase 1 / 2
trial. It was small: Only 40 volunteers received the full vaccine with
both kinds of adenoviruses. No one received a placebo.

By comparison, the Chinese firm CanSinoBio ran a [Phase 1 / 2
trial](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)31605-6/fulltext)
that included 382 people who received the vaccine and another 126 who
were given a placebo.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Russian vaccine produced mild symptoms in a number of subjects, the
most common of which were fevers and headaches. Other adenovirus-based
vaccines have produced similar side effects.

“You expect to have some symptoms — that’s normal,” Dr. Bar-Zeev said.

The researchers found that volunteers who received the full vaccine
produced antibodies that could block the virus from replicating in
cells.

To gauge the performance of their vaccine, the Russian researchers
compared the level of antibodies with samples taken from people who had
recovered from natural infections of Covid-19. Convalescent plasma, as
these samples are known, contain antibodies to the virus that people
make on their own.

In the paper, the researchers said that vaccinated people had the same
levels of antibodies as those found in convalescent plasma.

Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who was not involved
in the study, said the vaccine produced “good antibody levels in all
volunteers.”

In their paper, the authors said that the levels of neutralizing
antibodies produced by their vaccine were lower than those reported for
vaccines made by AstraZeneca and Moderna, two of the candidates
[furthest along in clinical

AstraZeneca’s. It said that the level of antibodies from vaccinated
volunteers was “1.4-1.5 times higher than the level of antibodies of

AstraZeneca, they claimed, only produced antibody levels equal to that

It is not clear why the paper presents a different picture. The authors

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an

        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York who was
not involved in the study, said that it was too early to make any
meaningful comparisons among the various Covid-19 vaccines. Each team
uses different tests to measure antibody levels. And each group of
recovered patients they study for convalescent plasma may have different
levels of antibodies.

“We have long been suffering from the apples-versus-oranges scenario,
but now we’re into fruit salad territory, and it drives me bananas
trying to figure it all out,” he said.

One thing is clear, however: No Phase 1 / 2 trial can demonstrate
protection against Covid-19.

That requires a so-called Phase 3 trial, in which a large number of
volunteers are given either a vaccine or a placebo. A Phase 3 trial can
also reveal harmful side effects missed by small preliminary studies.

In their paper, the Russian scientists wrote that they got approval on
Aug. 26 to run a Phase 3 trial on 40,000 people. There are
[seven](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
other vaccines currently in these late-stage trials. Johnson & Johnson
is expected to start its own Phase 3 trial later this month, and Novavax
is expected to start its own in October, bringing the total to 10.

Phase 3 trials can take months to yield clear results, Dr. Bar-Zeev
said, and even then they have to be carefully reviewed before any
decision is made about using a vaccine widely.

“Yes, we all want a vaccine, but we don’t want to make a mistake,” he
said. “So hang in there and wait, so we know what we’re getting into.”
