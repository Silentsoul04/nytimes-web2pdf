\section{Russians Publish Early Coronavirus Vaccine
Results}\label{russians-publish-early-coronavirus-vaccine-results}}

The first batch of public data from the ``Sputnik V'' vaccine showed
that it was safe and produced an immune response. No one knows yet
whether it prevents coronavirus infections.

On Friday, a team of Russian scientists
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3/fulltext}{published}
the first report on their
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/health/covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-trans.html}{Covid-19
vaccine}, which had been roundly criticized because of President
Vladimir Putin's decision last month to approve it before clinical
trials had proved it safe and effective.

In a small group of volunteers, the scientists found that the vaccine
produced a modest level of antibodies against the coronavirus, while
causing only mild side effects. The research has not yet shown, however,
whether people who are vaccinated are less likely to become infected
than those who are not.

In August, Mr. Putin
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine-approval.html}{announced}
with great fanfare that the vaccine --- called
\href{https://sputnikvaccine.com/}{Sputnik V} --- ``works effectively
enough'' to be approved. He declared its approval to be a ``very
important step for our country, and generally for the whole world.''

But vaccine developers
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/health/russia-covid-19-vaccine-safety.html}{denounced}
the decision, observing that no data had been published on the vaccine.
In addition, the critics pointed out, the Russian scientists had yet to
run a large trial of tens of thousands of people, which is required to
demonstrate that a vaccine works.

The new paper, published in the Lancet, contains the first batch of
public data from Sputnik V's clinical trials. Independent scientists
were impressed by the rigor of the work.

``The science looks like it was done impeccably well,'' said Naor
Bar-Zeev of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who is
the co-author of a
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31867-5/fulltext}{commentary}
on the new paper. Still, he cautioned that no one will know if Sputnik V
is safe and effective until the larger trials are completed.

``We should welcome a Russian vaccine if it's successful, and we should
welcome other vaccines if they're successful,'' Dr. Bar-Zeev said. ``But
they should all be equally rigorously evaluated.''

Researchers at the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow used a design
for the vaccine that they had previously developed and tested for MERS,
a disease caused by another coronavirus.

The Sputnik V vaccine stimulates the immune system by coaxing a person's
cells to make a protein normally found on the coronavirus that causes
Covid-19. The researchers loaded the gene for this viral protein into a
second virus, called an adenovirus.

When injected into the arm, the adenovirus slips into muscle cells. It
has been genetically engineered so that it cannot make copies of itself
or cause illness. But once it delivers the coronavirus gene into a cell,
the cell starts making the protein.

Similar adenovirus-based vaccines
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{are
also being tested} by several other teams, including AstraZeneca,
CanSinoBio and Johnson \& Johnson.

Each team is testing a different strain of adenovirus. Unlike the rest,
the Russian team is combining two adenoviruses into one vaccine. For
their initial clinical trial, the Gamaleya researchers gave volunteers
an initial shot of an adenovirus called Ad26, and then, three weeks
later, a shot of one known as Ad5.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/09/04/science/04VIRUS-RUSSIA4/merlin_174581061_e23bb7ce-9895-4e22-90b4-4b4860bf4ede-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75\&auto=webp\&disable=upscale}

In the Lancet paper, the researchers said that they tested the vaccine
on hamsters and monkeys. They claimed the animals were protected against
the coronavirus without any harmful side effects but did not present any
data about these studies in their new paper.

The trial they ran on human volunteers was what's known as a Phase 1 / 2
trial. It was small: Only 40 volunteers received the full vaccine with
both kinds of adenoviruses. No one received a placebo.

By comparison, the Chinese firm CanSinoBio ran a
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31605-6/fulltext}{Phase
1 / 2 trial} that included 382 people who received the vaccine and
another 126 who were given a placebo.

The Russian vaccine produced mild symptoms in a number of subjects, the
most common of which were fevers and headaches. Other adenovirus-based
vaccines have produced similar side effects.

``You expect to have some symptoms --- that's normal,'' Dr. Bar-Zeev
said.

The researchers found that volunteers who received the full vaccine
produced antibodies that could block the virus from replicating in
cells.

To gauge the performance of their vaccine, the Russian researchers
compared the level of antibodies with samples taken from people who had
recovered from natural infections of Covid-19. Convalescent plasma, as
these samples are known, contain antibodies to the virus that people
make on their own.

In the paper, the researchers said that vaccinated people had the same
levels of antibodies as those found in convalescent plasma.

Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who was not involved
in the study, said the vaccine produced ``good antibody levels in all
volunteers.''

A look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans.

In their paper, the authors said that the levels of neutralizing
antibodies produced by their vaccine were lower than those reported for
vaccines made by AstraZeneca and Moderna, two of the candidates
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{furthest
along in clinical trials}.

But in a
\href{https://sputnikvaccine.com/newsroom/pressreleases/rdif-and-the-gamaleya-national-research-center-of-epidemiology-and-microbiology-announce-the-publica/}{news
release}, the Gamaleya Institute implied that its vaccine was superior
to AstraZeneca's. It said that the level of antibodies from vaccinated
volunteers was ``1.4-1.5 times higher than the level of antibodies of
patients who had recovered from Covid-19.''

AstraZeneca, they claimed, only produced antibody levels equal to that
in convalescent plasma.

It is not clear why the paper presents a different picture. The authors
of the study did not respond to a request for comment.

John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York who was
not involved in the study, said that it was too early to make any
meaningful comparisons among the various Covid-19 vaccines. Each team
uses different tests to measure antibody levels. And each group of
recovered patients they study for convalescent plasma may have different
levels of antibodies.

``We have long been suffering from the apples-versus-oranges scenario,
but now we're into fruit salad territory, and it drives me bananas
trying to figure it all out,'' he said.

One thing is clear, however: No Phase 1 / 2 trial can demonstrate
protection against Covid-19.

That requires a so-called Phase 3 trial, in which a large number of
volunteers are given either a vaccine or a placebo. A Phase 3 trial can
also reveal harmful side effects missed by small preliminary studies.

In their paper, the Russian scientists wrote that they got approval on
Aug. 26 to run a Phase 3 trial on 40,000 people. There are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html}{seven}
other vaccines currently in these late-stage trials. Johnson \& Johnson
is expected to start its own Phase 3 trial later this month, and Novavax
is expected to start its own in October, bringing the total to 10.

Phase 3 trials can take months to yield clear results, Dr. Bar-Zeev
said, and even then they have to be carefully reviewed before any
decision is made about using a vaccine widely.

``Yes, we all want a vaccine, but we don't want to make a mistake,'' he
said. ``So hang in there and wait, so we know what we're getting into.''
