Chadwick Boseman embodied a James Baldwin dictum: “History is not the
past. It is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our
history.” Boseman carried our history insistently, imbuing titans of the
real and imagined worlds with the best parts of himself. He recognized
that they, too, make metaphors out of history even as it is being
rewritten with every breath. He understood how exhausting it is to be
made accountable minute by minute, how small almost all of us become
inside that kind of accounting.

What does it mean to be a cinematic citizen of the mind — cheekbones
writ large, smiling like a big idea? There’s self-possession in that
understanding, broad-shouldered chin to the sun. Restorer,
re-historicizer of the Black backdrop in America and elsewhere. What
about masculinity and isolation? What about the unrelenting gravity of
community expectations and aspirations? Right in the nexus of need,
trying to Mashed Potato between expression, obligation, light bills and
wonder. How does history render the heavy load of itself unto itself?

## ⬩

In lead roles, Boseman mostly played the outlier: the one with
conviction, the one with enough crust and wherewithal to understand that
everybody from the high steppers to the low downs is made of antiquity,
sunlight and iron. What happens with that mix is the real alchemy, and
he used it to re-dimension their largess and redefine their rough
multitudes. The human capacity to harm other humans is as inexhaustible
as gravity but not as inevitable.

## ⬩

During the week I’m writing this, Jacob Blake was paralyzed when
Kenosha, Wis., police officers shot him in the back seven times in front
of his three children. And in the aftermath the W.N.B.A. and the N.B.A.
and the M.L.S. and even the M.L.B. all refused to practice or play. And
on the same day Jacob Blake was shot, Chadwick Boseman was dying from an
illness that was nobody else’s business.

## ⬩

It’s not a metaphor that Chadwick Boseman died on Jackie Robinson Day
2020. It’s only *not enough* and *gone too soon,* the same way you might
catch the tasseled edge of someone rounding a winter corner just as the
flurries settle on your forehead and cheeks.

## ⬩

Like all of us Black men born in the 1970s, Boseman was part of the
generation directly or indirectly bequeathed PTSD by the conscripts
returning from the Vietnam War. Fathers, uncles, older cousins,
neighbors — they all came back with language that could only be
syncopated through the body — the meat of it, the destruction of it, the
abandonment of it. Undo the body, and the brain will follow.

It’s hard not to think about unbuckled history while watching Boseman’s
Stormin’ Norman in “Da 5 Bloods.” He’s complicit in violence even as he
tries to free himself of it. He sees the long history of it being
revisited bullet by bullet and can’t figure out how to stop it. The
persistent conundrum of masculinity, whether in a ballpark in Brooklyn,
a courtroom in Connecticut or a Hollywood premiere.

## ⬩

*There’s no possible way that you can show it exactly how it happened.
But you feel responsible for things being as authentic as they can be.
You don’t want to show the sugarcoated version of the person. You’re not
free unless you can show the good and the bad, all sides of them. So to
me, when I play a character it’s important that I can show every aspect
of them.*

— Chadwick Boseman, from an interview with Shadow & Act

## ⬩

As distractingly beautiful as he was, Boseman still managed to let the
characters he played be seen fully with all their rips and scuffs.
There’s a chaotic scene in “Get On Up” ** that takes place right after
the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., ** in which Boseman as
James Brown admonishes the crowd for trying to get onstage to dance with
him. “Let’s represent ourselves,” he says. “You make me look bad. We are
Black. Don’t make us all look bad.” As if history needs a kind of
veneer, even in the moment. Liberation’s opposite from James Brown, who
loosened up almost everybody who camel walked with him.

Sometimes a country dislikes its metaphor so much that it covers up in a
brocade of sycophancy. Sometimes language misshapes because of insistent
violence: decorum forgotten, referendums ignored, and the racism flags
are everywhere with their snakes and stars and mismatched colors
twisting over the local houses. On the marquee at the theater across the
street: a poster for “Black Panther” ** with Chadwick Boseman’s unmasked
face looking down, clawed gloves curled inward toward him. In the
unrepentant shadows it’s hard to tell if he’s studying or mediating, but
it’s still a beatitude of Blackness: color as signifier, color as
artifact, color as stone cold fact.

## ⬩

We can never know the authentic version of a person, whether it’s Jackie
Robinson or Thurgood Marshall or Chadwick Boseman costumed as T’Challa.
Whatever we think we know about the actor, one thing is for real: He
shared his characters’ nuances like gentle libations — and by “share” I
mean that *physically*, how he held them out to us with both hands.
Here, take this, he says, and in his cupped palms is a memory of a first
at bat or a thunderclap from a distant Tuesday or a bright morning in
Wakanda when the sun, just cresting the infinite skyline, blinks against
the mirrored windows. This is for you, he says, and we get to see all
the possibility he wants us to know.
