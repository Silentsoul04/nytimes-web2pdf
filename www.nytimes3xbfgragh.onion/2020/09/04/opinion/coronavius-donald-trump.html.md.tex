My body is a stranger. It is out there battling the enemy within.

PARIS

A friend of mine opened her closet the other day and felt she was gazing
at the clothes of a dead person. They belonged to \emph{the world of
yesterday}. She had no use for them in the age of the coronavirus. It
was like looking at her grandmother's clothes after she died.

Everyone is jolted these days in such ways. I assumed I would not get
Covid-19 if I took basic precautions. Now I have Covid-19. My head feels
like a cabbage. Aches swirl down my arms and legs. So please, dear
reader, grant me a little indulgence this once.

My symptoms began Thursday Aug. 27, a sharp prickling in my throat, from
nothing. A cabdriver said, ``You are coughing, sir.'' I said, I know, I
am sorry, I am trying not to cough.

I am in a Paris apartment I have rented for a couple of weeks. On the
bookshelves my eyes fell on a copy of Stefan Zweig's ``The World of
Yesterday,'' written in Brazil before he and his wife, Charlotte
Altmann,
\href{https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/27/the-escape-artist-3}{committed
suicide in 1942}. A Viennese Jew born into an empire that no longer
existed, his books burned in a Europe reduced to barbarism, Zweig wrote:
``All the livid steeds of the Apocalypse have stormed through my life.''

A day later my symptoms worsened. I had a fever of 101. Hot flushes, and
shivers, alternated. My mind swirled. So, this is it. The plague that
stopped the world. I was more curious than afraid. It's hard to shed the
reflexes of a life lived as an observer.

Since the pandemic started, I have wondered, like everybody, how to
live. ``Stay safe'' is no guide to a life worth living. Surrender to
fear and it's over. My most powerful memories and experiences involved
risk. When you quit, you're done. Yet now an invisible enemy demanded
prudence.

For more than three months I scarcely moved from my Brooklyn
neighborhood.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/opinion/coronavirus-new-york.html}{I
mourned New York}. I tried to get used to the end of conviviality and
the way ``coronavirus'' slips from the tongues of my five grandchildren,
aged 2 to 6.

I tried and failed. Still, we have to get on with it, show up. That's
life's first admonition. I drove to Georgia,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/opinion/let-freedom-ring-from-georgia.html}{did
some reporting}, and wrote. I came to Europe to look and listen.

Zweig's book fell open at this: ``I have seen the great mass ideologies
grow and spread before my eyes --- Fascism in Italy, National Socialism
in Germany, Bolshevism in Russia, and above all else that pestilence of
pestilences, nationalism, which has poisoned the flower of our European
culture.''

My president, Donald Trump, is a proud \emph{nationalist.}
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/us/politics/trump-police-protests.html}{He
embraces} its mythology of violence as he flirts with cataclysm. Jump!
he says. How high? says his cabinet. He's ready to fight his battles
down to the last sucker. If he goes down, it will be in flames.

The virus is deadly serious but plays games. A little relief to tempt
you into activity --- then it smites you with a cudgel. I felt better
last weekend until I tried a peach tart. It's eerie to experience
texture without taste. A Coke with ice and lemon was no more than fizz.
My body was a stranger. It was out there somewhere, fighting. The fight
demanded all its energy. There was nothing left for me.

I stared at the walls. I thought, my world is gone. More than half a
life lived in the Cold War, who cares about that any longer, or the
values it bequeathed. A phrase of Albert Camus came back to me: ``The
most incorrigible vice being that of ignorance that fancies it knows
everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill.''

For three hours I lined up for a free coronavirus test. A medic told me
the swab in my nostrils would be ``disagreeable but not painful.'' She
then stabbed my brain with what looked like a narrow brochette stick.
``That was painful,'' I said.

My test result, received two days later, was ``positive.'' I knew it
would be, but still reading the lab result was hard. I am not sure why.
Perhaps the certain knowledge that a virus is inside you that could kill
you. But then so many things can, and death is life's one certainty ---
and we don't stop the world. We try to make life better. The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic.html}{only
way out of this is through}.

The plague is back. In fact, as Camus observed, it never goes away. It
is waiting to exploit stupidity. Trump wants violence. Do not give it to
him. Turn the other cheek. Be stoical. Be the person who stops the tank
by standing there.

I am hunkered down. My survival chances are still better than those of
an opposition leader in the Russia of Trump's buddy. My daughter and her
husband, both doctors, say I have a moderate case. I think I picked it
up in a crowded Paris bar watching a soccer match. Whether soccer or
life is more important is an open question to me.

The epigraph to Zweig's book is a quote from Shakespeare's
``Cymbeline'':

``And meet the time as it seeks us.''

I will still try to do that. We must all fight, in the way my body is
fighting now with every ounce of its strength to see off the enemy
within, if the orange face of the plague is not to devour us all.
