For workers who are required to be on-site, fear of public

From her East Village walk-up, Jessica Fine used to take the subway to
her job as a physician assistant on the Upper East Side. When the
pandemic began, she switched to Citi Bike for the three-mile commute.

Now she has plans to move, so she can avoid the subway for good.

In the spring, she and her fiancé started hunting for a co-op to buy.
“Proximity to work is a big factor for me,” said Ms. Fine, 29. “We are
looking in the radius where I can bike or walk to work. I work in a
hospital, so I will never be working from home.”

Avoiding public transit has been a “precautionary measure that is easy
to take,” she said, “because even though I don’t think I’m sick, I don’t
know who’s riding that subway car with me, who’s sitting next to me, who
sat there an hour ago and coughed on the pole.”

Subway ridership fell by 90 percent in April, after Gov. Andrew Cuomo
signed the New York State on PAUSE executive order, advising New Yorkers
to limit their use of public transportation. With
[unemployment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/nyregion/nyc-unemployment.html)
reaching record levels, subway ridership has since [reached only a
quarter of usual
levels](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/nyregion/nyc-subway-bus-service-cuts.html)
even as more people have returned to work in recent months.

Ms. Fine and her fiancé, Bryon Shek, are focusing on co-ops close to her

of Herald Square, but is working from home indefinitely.

While many city dwellers with the wherewithal are [moving to the
suburbs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/nyregion/nyc-suburbs-housing-demand.html),
where they can find more space and work more comfortably from home, real
estate agents are reporting a surge of interest from clients looking to
live closer to their city jobs. For essential workers and those whose
jobs require them to be on-site — including medical workers like Ms.
Fine — the issue is especially germane.

Ms. Fine and Mr. Shek, who were already getting tired of living on the
sixth floor of a seven-story walk-up, focused on Midtown East, said
their agent, Harjot Kaur Nayar, of Keller Williams NYC.

“Their priorities were very clear, which made it much easier to look for
homes — a starter one-bedroom co-op type, easy enough for her to get to
the hospital and for him to work out of,” Ms. Nayar said.

If Mr. Shek returns to his office, he will have a quick walk rather than
a subway trip. A bonus: “We will be able to avoid a crowded laundromat
because there is a laundry room on each floor,” he said.

For Ms. Fine, whose workday sometimes starts at 6 a.m., the subway or
bus “is there if I want it,” she said. “I anticipate biking more often
than I did pre-Covid. I think it has become more valuable to people —
the proximity to work and not having to rely on public transit. It’s a
factor in a big decision because we are making a multiyear,
multi-thousand-dollar investment, and want to make sure work is not
going to be compromised.”

Pandemic or not, New York is a walkable city. In recent years, around 10
percent of New Yorkers have reported walking to work, with about 56
percent using public transit, according to census information.

Recent figures from the real estate data site
[UrbanDigs](http://urbandigs.com/), examining the ratio of new listings
to contracts signed, show that so far this year, pending sales of homes
within a 10-minute walk to “work” neighborhoods have fallen 34 percent
from the market average. (“Work” neighborhoods are defined as those
dense with office buildings, such as Midtown and the financial district.
Meanwhile, pending sales in “neutral” neighborhoods, which are more than
a 10-minute walk from a concentration of schools or office buildings,
have risen 16 percent.) That’s not surprising — many people who are
working remotely or who have lost their jobs aren’t looking to move into
crowded neighborhoods right now. But real estate agents say that among
workers who must travel to work — as well as some who know they’ll be
returning to their offices eventually — demand in these areas is robust.

At an available one-bedroom co-op unit on East 57th Street, listed in
the high $500,000s, many prospective buyers specifically have mentioned
proximity to their
[Midtown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/06/08/realestate/condos-and-restaurants-make-midtown-east-more-desirable.html)
offices, said the listing agent, Ryan Aussem, of Brown Harris Stevens.
“People state it like it’s normal now: ‘I will go back to work at some
point; I am looking where I won’t have to rely on public
transportation.’”

His sellers there, Heather and Patrick Hofer, both of whom work in
finance, enjoyed walking to their Midtown offices before the city shut
down, with stops for coffee (her) or the gym (him) along the way. “When
everyone started getting freaked out and said we have to work at home, I
was not concerned, because I didn’t have to take the subway,” Mr. Hofer
said. “I could walk to work and keep myself safe. I still wanted to go
to the office because we were blessed to have an apartment so close to
work.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

Mr. Hofer was soon required to work remotely, so his walk became moot.
Now, with an infant son, the Hofers are planning to decamp to a house in
Connecticut.

Many New Yorkers cannot avoid a lengthy subway or bus ride because they
commute to jobs in Manhattan from other boroughs. But until this year,
Mr. Aussem said, most of his buyers were generally content with a
20-minute subway commute. “Now, it’s: Let’s make that a 15-minute walk,”
he said. “You have people who are really focusing on a long-term play in
their life, where they are altering their transportation situation so
they can have a safer, or what is perceived as safer, way to get to
work.”

It’s not just trips to work. Some people hope to avoid public
transportation to almost everywhere. The pandemic spurred Alessandra
Rago to give up her downtown rental, which required a subway trip to her
office near Rockefeller Center. She has been staying with her parents in
New Jersey while working remotely. It seemed like a good time to hunt
for a one-bedroom to buy.

“I was a bit of a germaphobe before the virus, so I am probably of the
population that is taking the virus more seriously than others,” said
Ms. Rago, 29, who works at an asset management firm. “I can’t even
imagine being on the subway until everything calms down and we return to
some kind of normalcy. Everything is so uncertain going forward that I
want as much flexibility in my new apartment as possible. I don’t want
to depend on the subway or the bus for the places I go every day.”

Those places include a good grocery store and her exercise studio, which
has multiple branches. (Gyms in New York City were [permitted to reopen
on
Sept. 2](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/nyregion/nyc-gyms-reopening.html),
with restrictions.)

“Before we looked at anything, she had to ‘Google walk’ them to find out
if that element would work for her,” said her agent, Brenda Di Bari, of
Halstead.

“I am using Google Maps to gauge how sustainable a walking commute would
be for any given apartment,” said Ms. Rago, who is targeting co-ops in
Midtown East in the $600,000 range. “Will I walk an extra seven minutes
for a bigger apartment? A lot of these places have
trade-offs.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

She has been touring prospective homes masked and gloved, she said:
“Brokers don’t even want you to touch anything.”

For Josie O’Toole, a renter, the pandemic became an unexpected reason to
leave her beloved West Village, where she lived for seven years. She is
a pediatric nurse practitioner at Mount Sinai Hospital, north of
[Carnegie
Hill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/13/realestate/carnegie-hill-a-quiet-enclave-bordering-the-park.html).
Working from home, she said, “doesn’t apply to health care. I have to be
there.”

Ms. O’Toole, 30, had been commuting via the packed 6 train. “When
everything started to get scary, I had taken the subway once and decided
that was going to be the last time,” she said. She switched to Citi
Bike, but the ride was long, so she temporarily stayed at a friend’s
place near her hospital. (The friend had skipped town to avoid the
virus.)

“I didn’t know how long this was going to go on for,” she said, “so I
decided to look on the Upper East Side, which I thought I would never
do. The West Village was where my friends were and my life was.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

No longer. Several friends moved back home with their parents. “That
made it easier to leave the West Village,” she said. “My friends weren’t
even there. All of my favorite places were boarded up.”

Some rentals weren’t allowing in-person visits, which limited her
options, and she refused to take a place sight unseen. “I was way too
skeptical because that can be so deceiving,” Ms. O’Toole said. “You
can’t check stuff like water pressure. You can’t see into every
corner.”

She was able to visit one studio in person, about 20 blocks south of the
hospital. That’s the one she now calls home. She has a 20-minute walk to
work, or a five-minute Citi Bike ride. “I will bring a Clorox wipe with
me and wipe down the handlebars,” she said.

The listing agent for her rental, Peggy Dahan, of Brown Harris Stevens,
is seeing a brisk rental market. “People want to be no more than 30
blocks from work because they want to get the fresh air,” she said.
“Once they get to work, they are in their mask, so because they are
going to be in the mask all day, they prefer to walk. They would love to
take the Citi Bike, but sooner or later it is going to start raining and
be cold.”

Ms. Dahan also sees a trend away from shared apartments, even if it
means downsizing to studios. “People want to separate from their
roommates,” she said. “One roommate wants to be in the mask and one
couldn’t care less. One is partying and one is scared to go out. People
will spend an extra $800 or $1,000 a month to be healthy alone, on their
own.”

Despite the risk in buying a home sight unseen, Dr. Elie Harouche, a
surgeon, bought a one-bedroom Midtown pied-à-terre before setting foot
in it. (He and his wife, Rosemary Harouche, live primarily in Suffolk
County.) His main criterion was to be minutes from his workplace, a new
medical spa on East 57th Street, Clinique des Champs-Élysées, where he
is the director. The opening, which was delayed, is scheduled for next
week.

“The idea is to be proactive, so that if this virus is as virulent as
it’s explained, then we have to respect that,” said Dr. Harouche, 71.
“As a physician, I totally agree with all the distancing and
face-covering and hand-washing. There are ways to maintain health and
decrease the collateral damage this thing is doing to us.”

In April, there were plenty of available options for what the Harouches
were seeking — a one-bedroom in a doorman building in the 50s for around
$600,000, said their agent, Jed Lewin of Triplemint.

“The trend I’ve been seeing is an either-or,” Mr. Lewin said, noting
that some people crave more space, whether indoor or outdoor, while
others who anticipate a return to the office want proximity to work.
“Everyone has been re-evaluating whether being in a certain area has
the same advantages as it used to. For some, they really want to reduce
their risk of exposure by being around as few people as possible. For
people who do need to be somewhere specific, being able to walk is a
driving force.”

A transit-free commute, he said “is a small measure of control, and
control is what a lot of people have felt has been lacking.”
