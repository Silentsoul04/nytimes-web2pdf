Welcome to September.

As you may have known (or seen outside your window), the beginning of
this month brought a full moon. This moon, called the ``Corn Moon'' by
the Algonquin people, is the last full moon of summer.

September's full moon coincides with a number of celebrations in various
religions and cultures, including the Chinese Hungry Ghost Festival and
the Hindu Pitri Paksha, in which deceased people and ancestors are
remembered and honored.

With
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{hundreds
of thousands of people} killed by the coronavirus pandemic worldwide, we
thought we would begin this newsletter by remembering and honoring them.

As the seasons change, we hope that the health of the world will change
for the better as well. In the meantime, let's get involved in the
causes that are important to us and, of course, celebrate love.

On Sept. 1, Modern Love reopened submissions to its main column and Tiny
Love Stories. If you have a story --- long or short --- please consider
submitting before the inboxes temporarily close again in January.

Black and Indigenous people and other people of color are especially
encouraged to submit, as well as writers outside of the United States,
those with disabilities, and those who identify as members of

While love may be universal, individual experiences can differ
immensely. Modern Love is committed to publishing a range of experiences
and perspectives.
