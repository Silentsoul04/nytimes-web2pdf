\section{Treasured Recipes From Some of Italy's Fashion
Families}\label{treasured-recipes-from-some-of-italys-fashion-families}}

As we continue to eat mostly at home, these storied designers offer some
late-summer culinary inspiration.

There may be nothing better than enjoying
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/one-good-meal}{a summer
meal} at home: spending long lunches at long tables with thrown-together
salads and lots of cold wine, grilling corn and hot dogs at sunset after
a long day at the beach, gathering around a table to crack lobsters
under the stars. Right now, many of us are cooking multiple times a day
and sitting down with family for almost every meal --- a silver lining
(usually) --- and, as we enjoy the last dog days, are in desperate need
of inspiration. To that end, we've asked some of the fashion designers
who posed for our story on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/italian-fashion-design-houses.html}{family-run
Italian dynasties}, which ran in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/culture-issue-2020.html}{T's
Culture issue} this past spring, to share a recipe they like cooking for
the ones they love. Not surprisingly, many of these light, seasonal
dishes will allow you to take advantage of those crown jewels of summer,
such as August tomatoes in all their purple-y red glory. Buon appetito!

\textbf{Brunello Cucinelli's Panzanella}

``In Italy, the sense of tradition is very strong. It is in that
context, which I consider a noble one, that our cooking style
originated: using the simplest ingredients, where nothing ever goes to
waste, and any leftovers from the day before are reused. And it is
precisely this custom that has given rise to the most delicious dishes.
Meals are always eaten together, with everyone seated around the table,
a symbol of the family, the seed of society.'' ---

to the bread and tomato mixture.

5. Garnish with basil before serving.

year, this dish also works with branzino, pictured here. Either way, try
it with a crisp wine, such as this glass of Zamo Bianco, from

\textbf{Angela Missoni's Acqua Pazza Sea Bream Fillets}

``I love making this dish in my house in Sardinia, where I spend most of
my summer with my entire family.'' ---

\href{https://www.missoni.com/us}{Missoni}

\emph{Serves 4}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  About 2 pounds sea bream in fillets
\item
  About 14 ounces cherry tomatoes
\item
  About 3 ounces white wine
\item
  1 garlic clove
\item
  1 chile
\item
  Parsley
\item
  Olive oil
\item
  Salt
\end{itemize}

1. Dice the garlic clove.

2. Slice the chile in half, take out the seeds and dice.

3. Cut tomatoes like a cross from the top into four pieces. Put the sea
bream fillets in a frying pan and layer the tomatoes, garlic, chile,
wine and 4 spoons of olive oil on top.

4. Add enough to the pan to cover everything and top with salt. Turn on
the heat and bring to a boil.

5. Turn the heat to low for 15 minutes. Serve the fillets in a deep dish
and add some bouillon (broth).

6. Garnish with parsley.

\textbf{Stefano Canali's Pasta Strascicata}

``This is our summer holiday pasta, one which pleases everyone from
adults to children. Our recipe is simple, and the real secret is to use
fresh and local ingredients. This is the reason I usually cook it in
Sardinia. Here, I have the ability to use fresh-picked tomatoes.
Harvesting vegetables and fruit from the garden is a task reserved for
young people, from my daughter to her friends, who during the summer
live in direct contact with nature, in complete freedom.'' ---

Canali}, president and chief executive officer of
\href{https://www.canali.com/en_us/homepage.html}{Canali}

\emph{Serves 4}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  11 ounces fresh orecchiette pasta (Canali suggests using fresh
  homemade pasta for this dish, but if you don't have the time or skill
  set, store-bought fresh or dried orecchiette can be substituted)
\item
  1/4 red onion
\item
  18 ounces ripe cherry tomatoes, halved
\item
  10 salted capers
\item
  4 anchovies in olive oil
\item
  Extra-virgin olive oil
\item
  Salt
\item
  Black pepper
\item
  Ricotta salata
\end{itemize}

1. Bring water to boil in a large pot for the pasta.

2. Finely chop the onion.

3. In a large pan, over low heat, add 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin
olive oil and the finely chopped onion. Cook until onions are golden.

4. Rinse the capers in warm water and place them in the pan along with
anchovies and the halved cherry tomatoes and saut√©.

5. Once the pasta water begins to boil, salt the water and stir in the
orecchiette. Drain the pasta once al dente, saving some pasta water on
the side in case the consistency of the sauce needs to be adjusted.

6. Add the orecchiette to the pan and stir for a few minutes over low
heat, adding extra-virgin olive oil and pepper to taste.

7. Serve topped with grated ricotta salata to taste.

If fresh black-squid-ink tagliolini isn't available, chances are you can
find a cuttlefish version that will taste just as nice. The most
important thing, one could argue, is the lime juice.Credit...Photo by

\textbf{Alberta Ferretti's Squid Ink Tagliolini With Salmon and Ricotta
Cream}

``I love the light, sophisticated flavor of this dish, as well as the
slight, tart note of the lime. Fresh salmon eggs are the special touch.
I discovered this recipe a few years ago thanks to my chef, who
surprised me with it one evening at a wonderful dinner I had with a
group of friends who are passionate about the arts, which I still
remember with great pleasure.'' ---
