# California Is Dangerously Hot This Weekend

</div>

Temperature records were set in parts of the Western United States. They
might be followed by wind that could worsen fires in California, or
storms that could bring snow in Colorado.

Brutally hot and dry weather that was forecast across much of the
Western United States over the Labor Day weekend and California in
particular delivered as expected on Saturday.

[Record high
temperatures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/california-weather.html)
were recorded at [Woodland
Hills](https://twitter.com/NWSLosAngeles/status/1302367254953164800?s=20)
at 117 degrees and
[Palmdale](https://twitter.com/NWSLosAngeles/status/1302382428007194624?s=20)
at 111 degrees.
[Burbank’s](https://twitter.com/NWSLosAngeles/status/1302388165332721664?s=20)
high was 113 degrees, tying a record high for September that was set in
1971, according to the National Weather Service.

In the San Fernando Valley, temperatures were at least 112 degrees at 1
p.m. on Saturday, said Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist
at the National Weather Service’s Los Angeles/Oxnard forecasting office.

The state is still reeling from a [heat wave last
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/15/us/california-heat-wave-blackout.html)
that exacerbated a series of [devastating
wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/us/california-wildfires-photos.html),
including the second- and third-largest fires in California history.
Starting on Saturday, temperatures were expected to soar even higher
than before.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Saturday, the Weather Service issued a [red flag
warning](https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/fire2/?latitude=33.48&longitude=-117.02&latlon=Go&wfo=sgx&interface=fwzones)
until Sunday afternoon, which means there is an increased risk of fire
for the coastal mountain slopes and inland valleys of San Diego and
Riverside Counties.

“On Monday afternoon and evening, a few hours of elevated [fire
weather](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/climate/wildfires-climate-policy.html)
conditions are possible in the deserts and desert mountain slopes as
northwest winds develop with low relative humidity,” the Weather Service
said.

The temperatures in portions of southwest California were forecast to
reach their peak on Saturday and Sunday, according to the [Weather
Service](https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=lox&wwa=excessive%20heat%20warning).
An excessive heat warning remains in effect until Monday night. Highs in
Los Angeles County could reach 119 degrees.

“The hottest areas will even get close to 118 degrees,” Mr. Kittell
said, pointing to
[locations](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=34.18297270232944&lon=-118.57088671175165&site=all&smap=1#.X1J_imdKgU0)
in the western San Fernando Valley. “To put that in context, the
temperatures normal for this time of year were generally between 85 and
95. So we’re around 20 degrees above normal.”

Lynne Tolmachoff, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire, the state’s firefighting
agency, said firefighters had been making progress on containing the
blazes across the state. “There are a few that still have potential to
grow, so that’s definitely a concern,” she said.

Heat waves can dry up vegetation and are often followed by stronger
winds, which could exacerbate the fire risk after temperatures fall, Ms.
Tolmachoff said.

On Thursday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California [signed an emergency
proclamation](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/09/03/governor-newsom-signs-emergency-proclamation-to-free-up-additional-energy-capacity-amid-heat-wave/)
to “free up additional energy capacity amid extreme temperatures across
California.”

The California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state’s
electrical grid, [issued a statewide
alert](https://twitter.com/California_ISO/status/1302261219399577600?s=20)
that called for state residents to conserve energy from 3 to 9 p.m.
Alerts were also issued for Sunday and Monday.

“The ISO recognizes that reducing energy use during the hot time of the
day is a hardship, especially for those working from home or for
families with children schooling at home,” it said in a
[statement](http://www.caiso.com/Documents/Due-ExtremeHeatForecastsFlexAlertCalledTodayThroughMonday.pdf)
on Saturday. “However, if a large enough number of consumers conserve
even in small ways, they can help grid operators avoid more serious
system
emergencies.”

At the Back on the Beach Café in Santa Monica, Fred Deni, a co-owner,
said that there had been a line of customers into the parking lot at
7:45 a.m. and that business had not slowed, despite the heat wave and
the coronavirus pandemic.

“When I opened at 8, my 28 tables were filled, and we continue to be
filled,” said Mr. Deni, who has been a co-owner of the beachfront
restaurant for more than 40 years. “The shoreline looks like it’s July 4
all over again.”

Extreme heat is in the forecast for other Western states, too, including
Nevada, Utah and Arizona. In Colorado, temperatures in the Denver area
are expected to reach the high 90s on Saturday and Sunday, breaking
records for early September.

But a storm system is expected to bring a sharp drop in temperatures
around Monday evening, possibly down to around 40 by Tuesday — and with
good chance of snowfall.

Quickly changing temperatures are not new for Colorado, said Jim Kalina,
a Weather Service meteorologist in Boulder. But he added that both the
high temperatures in September and the potential for snow so early in
the year were atypical.

Heat and weather volatility are both related to climate change, said
Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, a nonprofit advocacy organization.

“The intersection of these events, like heat waves with a pandemic, are
something we will increasingly expect in the future as our climate is
pushed to more extreme conditions,” she added.

People who are marginalized are [likely to suffer the
most](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/06/climate/climate-change-inequality-heat.html).
Dr. Dahl noted that the same people who are more vulnerable to Covid-19
— including essential workers, people with underlying health
conditions and people who cannot afford good health care or shelter —
are the same people who are vulnerable in extreme heat.

Christina Morales contributed reporting.
