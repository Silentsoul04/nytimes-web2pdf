Drawing a sharp contrast with President Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. on
Thursday aligned himself strongly and sympathetically with protesters of
racial injustice and with Black voters during an afternoon of raw
interactions with people in Kenosha, Wis., who are still grappling with
the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

The former vice president repudiated Mr. Trump's divisive approach to
matters of racial injustice and civil unrest and offered an alternative
vision focused on national unity.

In his first day of campaigning outside his home state of Delaware or
neighboring Pennsylvania since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March,
Mr. Biden met for about an hour with Mr. Blake's family and legal team
immediately after landing in the critical battleground state of
Wisconsin, and spoke with Mr. Blake himself by phone.

Mr. Biden also hosted a listening session with activists, elected
officials, clergy members, businesspeople and a few law enforcement
officers, aiming to appeal to a broader cross-section of the community
than Mr. Trump did on his trip. The former vice president emphasized his
commitment to correcting decades of systemic racism, as he acknowledged
racial disparities in health care, education and the criminal justice
system and said that ``we're finally now getting to the point'' of
addressing ``the original sin: slavery. And all the vestiges of it.''

``Win or lose, I'm going to go down fighting,'' Mr. Biden said as he
described the possibility of a more just future. ``I'm going to go down
fighting for racial equality, equity across the board.''
