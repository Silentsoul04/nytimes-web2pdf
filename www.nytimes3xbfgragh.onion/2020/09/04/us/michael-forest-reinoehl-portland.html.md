Law enforcement agents in Washington State [killed a
suspect](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/michael-reinoehl-arrest-portland-shooting.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
on Thursday night in the [shooting death of a right-wing
activist](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/us/portland-trump-rally-shooting.html)
in Portland, Ore., last week, the latest development in the protests and
counterdemonstrations that have escalated tensions in the city and drawn
the nation’s attention.

The suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, was shot by officers in Lacey,
Wash., as they tried to arrest him, law enforcement officials said. The
right-wing activist, Aaron J. Danielson, 39, had been shot five days
earlier in Portland, and an arrest warrant for murder had been issued
for Mr. Reinoehl earlier on Thursday.

Mr. Reinoehl’s death is also playing out during a broader confrontation
between opposing visions for the nation, as protesters demanding racial
justice [clash with right-wing activists on the
streets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/portland-kenosha-protests-clashes.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)

presidential election.

Mr. Reinoehl was shot on Thursday night by officers from a federally led
fugitive task force, the U.S. Marshals Service said.

“Initial reports indicate the suspect produced a firearm, threatening
the lives of law enforcement officers,” the Marshals Service said in a
statement. “Task force members responded to the threat and struck the
suspect who was pronounced dead at the scene.”

An arrest warrant for Mr. Reinoehl had been obtained by the Portland
police through the Circuit Court in Multnomah County, Ore., earlier
Thursday, the Marshals Service said.

According to Lt. Ray Brady of the Thurston County Sheriff’s Office,
which is investigating the shooting of Mr. Reinoehl, a police team was
in a residential area of Lacey, a town southwest of Seattle, looking for
a homicide suspect.

Lieutenant Brady said on Friday that Mr. Reinoehl had a handgun with him
at the time of the shooting, but added that “we are not able to confirm
at this time if he fired shots.” He also said that he was not aware of
any footage of the shooting from body cameras or any other sources.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Lieutenant Brady said the suspect left an apartment and entered a
vehicle, where he was approached by the police officers.

“As they attempted to apprehend him, there was gunfire,” he said, adding
that four officers fired their weapons. Shots were fired into the
vehicle and the suspect fled, then more shots were fired, he said.

## Mr. Reinoehl had spoken about the Portland shooting.

Mr. Reinoehl, a father of two from a Portland suburb, had said he was an
Army veteran, though the Army said earlier this week that it could not
locate a record of service under his name. He had been a familiar face
at the protests for weeks, and described himself in posts on social
media as an anti-fascist activist. He also previously described
providing “security” at the protests.

“I am 100% ANTIFA all the way\!” he posted on Instagram in June,
referencing the loose collection of activists that have mobilized to
[oppose what they see as fascism or
racism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-antifa-trump.html).
That same post was also laced with violent messages.

“We truly have an opportunity right now to fix everything,” he wrote.
“But it will be a fight like no other\! It will be a war and like all
wars there will be casualties.”

In an interview with Vice News, [published earlier on
Thursday](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7g8vb/man-linked-to-killing-at-a-portland-protest-says-he-acted-in-self-defense),
Mr. Reinoehl appeared to admit to the shooting of Mr. Danielson, and
said he believed he had acted in self-defense.

“Had I not acted, I am confident that my friend and I am sure, I, would
have been killed, because I wasn’t going to stand there and let
something happen,” he said in the
interview.

## Portland’s protests have simmered for months.

The city of Portland has been [the site of nightly protests for three
months](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/31/us/portland-protests-map-photos.html?searchResultPosition=5)
since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis ignited national
demonstrations in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

At the height of the protests this summer, [federal agents were sent to
the
city](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/portland-federal-legal-jurisdiction-courts.html),
further raising tensions; they were withdrawn weeks later. On Saturday,
a large caravan of supporters of President Trump traveled through the
city as a counterprotest, and a small contingent broke off and traveled
through downtown.

Mr. Danielson, a supporter of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, was
part of the group that entered downtown Portland. That group clashed
with other protesters, firing [paintball guns and pepper spray from
trucks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/us/portland-trump-rally-shooting.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
as they moved through the streets, and as protesters threw objects at
them.

[An
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/video/portland-protests-shooting-investigation.html)
into videos taken in Portland on Saturday showed the moment of the
shooting, in which Mr. Danielson can be seen raising his arm and
beginning to spray a pepper spray-like substance before the gunshots are
heard. Mr. Danielson died at the
scene.

## The deaths have come amid turmoil in other cities.

The shooting of Mr. Danielson and the subsequent death of Mr. Reinoehl
have raised fears that of confrontations between Black Lives Matter
supporters and pro-Trump demonstrators in other cities could lead to
more deadly skirmishes.

In Kenosha, Wis., [demonstrations have gripped the
city](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html)
since mid-August when [a white police officer shot a Black man, Jacob
Blake](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/23/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html),
seven times in the back as he entered his car with his three children in
the back seat. Last week, [two people were
killed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/kenosha-shooting-protests-jacob-blake.html)
by a gunman as protesters clashed with counterprotesters.

Kyle Rittenhouse, 17-year-old from Illinois who attended the Kenosha
counterprotest armed with a military-style rifle, and whose social media
accounts were filled with messages of support for the “Blue Lives
Matter” movement and Mr. Trump, [has been charged with
homicide](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha.html)
in that shooting.

The divide over what constitutes racial justice and how to deal with
police violence has become a major political issue ahead of the upcoming
election.

Earlier this week, President Trump traveled to Wisconsin with a message
that [focused attention on street violence and
disorder](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/us/trump-vs-biden#trump-is-greeted-by-protesters-and-supporters-as-he-visits-wisconsin).
He was followed days later by his Democratic challenger, Joseph R. Biden
Jr., whose visit focused instead on [sympathizing with the protesters’
calls for racial
justice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/politics/joe-biden-kenosha.html).
