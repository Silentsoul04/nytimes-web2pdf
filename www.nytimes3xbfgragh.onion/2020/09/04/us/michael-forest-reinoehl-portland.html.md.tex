Shooting}\label{what-we-know-about-the-death-of-the-suspect-in-the-portland-shooting}}

The suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, was killed by law enforcement
agents just five days after the deadly shooting of a right-wing
protester.

Law enforcement agents in Washington State

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/us/portland-trump-rally-shooting.html}{shooting
death of a right-wing activist} in Portland, Ore., last week, the latest
development in the protests and counterdemonstrations that have
escalated tensions in the city and drawn the nation's attention.

The suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, was shot by officers in Lacey,
Wash., as they tried to arrest him, law enforcement officials said. The
right-wing activist, Aaron J. Danielson, 39, had been shot five days
earlier in Portland, and an arrest warrant for murder had been issued
for Mr. Reinoehl earlier on Thursday.

Mr. Reinoehl's death is also playing out during a broader confrontation
between opposing visions for the nation, as protesters demanding racial
justice
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/portland-kenosha-protests-clashes.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{clash
with right-wing activists on the streets} in events that have become
increasingly politicized ahead of the presidential election.

Mr. Reinoehl was shot on Thursday night by officers from a federally led
fugitive task force, the U.S. Marshals Service said.

``Initial reports indicate the suspect produced a firearm, threatening
the lives of law enforcement officers,'' the Marshals Service said in a
statement. ``Task force members responded to the threat and struck the
suspect who was pronounced dead at the scene.''

An arrest warrant for Mr. Reinoehl had been obtained by the Portland
police through the Circuit Court in Multnomah County, Ore., earlier
Thursday, the Marshals Service said.

According to Lt. Ray Brady of the Thurston County Sheriff's Office,
which is investigating the shooting of Mr. Reinoehl, a police team was
in a residential area of Lacey, a town southwest of Seattle, looking for
a homicide suspect.

Lieutenant Brady said on Friday that Mr. Reinoehl had a handgun with him
at the time of the shooting, but added that ``we are not able to confirm
at this time if he fired shots.'' He also said that he was not aware of
any footage of the shooting from body cameras or any other sources.

Lieutenant Brady said the suspect left an apartment and entered a
vehicle, where he was approached by the police officers.

``As they attempted to apprehend him, there was gunfire,'' he said,
adding that four officers fired their weapons. Shots were fired into the
vehicle and the suspect fled, then more shots were fired, he said.

Mr. Reinoehl, a father of two from a Portland suburb, had said he was an
Army veteran, though the Army said earlier this week that it could not
locate a record of service under his name. He had been a familiar face
at the protests for weeks, and described himself in posts on social
media as an anti-fascist activist. He also previously described
providing ``security'' at the protests.

``I am 100\% ANTIFA all the way!'' he posted on Instagram in June,
referencing the loose collection of activists that have mobilized to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-antifa-trump.html}{oppose
what they see as fascism or racism}. That same post was also laced with
violent messages.

``We truly have an opportunity right now to fix everything,'' he wrote.
``But it will be a fight like no other! It will be a war and like all
wars there will be casualties.''

In an interview with Vice News,
\href{https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7g8vb/man-linked-to-killing-at-a-portland-protest-says-he-acted-in-self-defense}{published
earlier on Thursday}, Mr. Reinoehl appeared to admit to the shooting of
Mr. Danielson, and said he believed he had acted in self-defense.

``Had I not acted, I am confident that my friend and I am sure, I, would
have been killed, because I wasn't going to stand there and let
something happen,'' he said in the interview.

The city of Portland has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/31/us/portland-protests-map-photos.html?searchResultPosition=5}{the
site of nightly protests for three months} since the police killing of
George Floyd in Minneapolis ignited national demonstrations in support
of the Black Lives Matter movement.

At the height of the protests this summer,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/portland-federal-legal-jurisdiction-courts.html}{federal
agents were sent to the city}, further raising tensions; they were
withdrawn weeks later. On Saturday, a large caravan of supporters of
President Trump traveled through the city as a counterprotest, and a
small contingent broke off and traveled through downtown.

Mr. Danielson, a supporter of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, was
part of the group that entered downtown Portland. That group clashed
with other protesters, firing
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/us/portland-trump-rally-shooting.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{paintball
guns and pepper spray from trucks} as they moved through the streets,
and as protesters threw objects at them.

investigation} into videos taken in Portland on Saturday showed the

arm and beginning to spray a pepper spray-like substance before the
gunshots are heard. Mr. Danielson died at the scene.

The shooting of Mr. Danielson and the subsequent death of Mr. Reinoehl
have raised fears that of confrontations between Black Lives Matter
supporters and pro-Trump demonstrators in other cities could lead to
more deadly skirmishes.

In Kenosha, Wis.,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html}{demonstrations
have gripped the city} since mid-August when
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/23/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html}{a
white police officer shot a Black man, Jacob Blake}, seven times in the
back as he entered his car with his three children in the back seat.
Last week,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/kenosha-shooting-protests-jacob-blake.html}{two
people were killed} by a gunman as protesters clashed with
counterprotesters.

Kyle Rittenhouse, 17-year-old from Illinois who attended the Kenosha
counterprotest armed with a military-style rifle, and whose social media
accounts were filled with messages of support for the ``Blue Lives
Matter'' movement and Mr. Trump,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha.html}{has
been charged with homicide} in that shooting.

The divide over what constitutes racial justice and how to deal with
police violence has become a major political issue ahead of the upcoming
election.

Earlier this week, President Trump traveled to Wisconsin with a message
that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/us/trump-vs-biden\#trump-is-greeted-by-protesters-and-supporters-as-he-visits-wisconsin}{focused
attention on street violence and disorder}. He was followed days later
by his Democratic challenger, Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose visit focused
instead on
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/politics/joe-biden-kenosha.html}{sympathizing
with the protesters' calls for racial justice}.

Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio and Alan Yuhas.
