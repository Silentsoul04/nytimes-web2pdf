Soldiers
`Disgusting'}\label{a-furious-biden-calls-trumps-reported-insults-of-fallen-soldiers-disgusting}}

Responding to a report that President Trump had called soldiers killed
in combat ``losers,'' Joe Biden used his outrage to draw a contrast with
his opponent over leadership and decency.

WILMINGTON, Del. ---
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/06/us/politics/trump-biden-2020.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr}. strained to contain his disgust with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/06/us/politics/trump-biden-2020.html}{President
Trump} on Friday over a report that Mr. Trump had made extraordinarily
disrespectful remarks about fallen soldiers.

Then he turned to the coronavirus pandemic and the financial pain it had
inflicted on millions of Americans. Mr. Trump, he said, ``just doesn't
care.''

And a day earlier, in Kenosha, Wis., Mr. Biden presented himself as a
unifying force determined to confront racial injustice --- a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/04/us/trump-vs-biden/in-kenosha-this-week-the-contrast-between-trump-and-biden-was-strong}{very
different message} from the one Mr. Trump sent during his visit to the
city two days earlier.

After Democrats spent their convention last month casting him as the
candidate of empathy, Mr. Biden found himself with the opportunity to
demonstrate that in real time this week.

Over two days, in a key battleground state and in his own backyard, Mr.
Biden drew unmistakably sharp contrasts with Mr. Trump --- not just
about policy ideas or management competence, but also about showing
respect and understanding Americans' struggles.

On Friday, in a fiery speech and a subsequent news conference, Mr. Biden
expressed outrage over a report by
\href{https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/}{The
Atlantic} that Mr. Trump had referred to American soldiers killed in
combat during World War I as ``losers'' and ``suckers'' and had
repeatedly shown disdain for military service at other points in his
presidency. Mr. Trump and a number of his aides have
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/politics/trump-veterans-losers.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{denied}
the reporting, which cited multiple sources but did not name them.

``If what is written in The Atlantic is true, it's disgusting,'' Mr.
Biden said in remarks he delivered in a Wilmington gymnasium a short
drive from his home. ``And it affirms what most of us believe to be
true: that Donald Trump is not fit to do the job of president, to be the
commander in chief.''

Ticking through a list of other well-documented instances in which Mr.
Trump has dismissed the sacrifices of military veterans, including those
of Senator John McCain, Mr. Biden continued, ``President Trump has
demonstrated he has no sense of service, no loyalty to any cause other
than himself.''

Mr. Biden spoke in strikingly personal terms about the military service
of his son Beau Biden, who served in the Iraq war and died in 2015 of
brain cancer.

With barely concealed fury, he said that Beau Biden ``wasn't a
`sucker,''' adding, ``The servicemen and women he served with,
particularly those who did not come home, were not `losers.'''

He called the report ``absolutely damnable,'' and he was unsparing in
denouncing Mr. Trump's behavior. ``I've just never been as disappointed
in my whole career with a leader that I've worked with, president or
otherwise,'' he said.

``It is sick,'' Mr. Biden added. ``It is deplorable. It is so
un-American. It is so unpatriotic.''

Mr. Trump on Friday repeated his denial of the report. ``It was a
totally fake story, and that was confirmed by many people who were
actually there,'' he told reporters in the Oval Office. ``I've done more
for the military than almost anybody else.''

Military veterans often lean Republican, and they supported Mr. Trump
over Hillary Clinton by a large margin in the 2016 election,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html}{according
to exit polls}. But in 2018 a number of the most prominent Democratic
House candidates were veterans, and Mr. Biden, who has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/us/politics/republican-national-security-biden.html}{endorsed
by a long list of Republican national security experts}, hopes to appeal
to more voters with ties to the military.

Mr. Biden's condemnation of Mr. Trump came in a speech that was
otherwise focused on the economy, an area that has been a source of
political strength for the president, though the ravages of the pandemic
have threatened his standing on the issue. In a national
\href{https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3671}{Quinnipiac
University poll} released Wednesday, likely voters were evenly split on
whether Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden would do a better job handling the
economy.

But Mr. Biden's reaction to the president's reported comments set the
tone for his event, at which he also fielded questions from the news
media. Asked about supporters of QAnon, the pro-Trump conspiracy theory,
Mr. Biden suggested they should seek treatment.

``I've been a big supporter of mental health,'' he said. ``I'd recommend
the people who believe it maybe should take advantage while it still
exists in the Affordable Care Act. It's bizarre. Totally bizarre.''

Before Mr. Biden's speech, the Labor Department
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/business/economy/jobs-report.html}{provided
a snapshot} of the virus's continuing economic toll. Job growth slowed
in August, the department said, as the economy added 1.4 million jobs,
fewer than in the previous three months. Payrolls remain more than 11
million jobs below their level before the pandemic. The unemployment
rate declined to 8.4 percent, down from 14.7 percent in April.

``You can't have an economic comeback when almost 1,000 Americans die
each day from Covid,'' Mr. Biden said in his speech, faulting the
president over his handling of the virus and noting the economic damage
it had inflicted on the American public.

``The painful truth is, we just have a president who just doesn't see
it,'' Mr. Biden said. ``He doesn't feel it. He doesn't understand. He
just doesn't care. He thinks if the stock market is up, then
everything's fine. If his wealthy friends and donors are doing well,
then everything's doing well.''

In response to the jobs report, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, Tim
Murtaugh, said in a statement that Mr. Biden ``hopes for economic ruin
to buoy his political fortunes.''

``While the work is not finished,'' he said, ``President Trump's
policies positioned us to fight through the coronavirus crisis and
reopen faster than doomsayers like Biden predicted.''
