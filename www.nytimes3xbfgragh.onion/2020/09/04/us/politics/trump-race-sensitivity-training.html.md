President Trump has directed administration officials to make
significant changes to sensitivity training sessions across the
government, calling such efforts that often focus on promoting awareness
of racism “divisive” and “un-American propaganda.”

The directive was laid out on Friday afternoon in a
[memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/M-20-34.pdf)
from the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell T.
Vought, to executive branch agency heads.

The brief memo — which repeatedly referred to “press reports,” not
government documents — tells the agencies to “begin to identify all
contracts or other agency spending related to any training on ‘critical
race theory,’ ‘white privilege,’ or any other training or propaganda
effort that teaches or suggests either (1) that the United States is an
inherently racist or evil country or (2) that any race or ethnicity is
inherently racist or evil.”

The memo comes at a time of a national discussion about race, in which
Mr. Trump has been firmly against systemic changes in policing and
government.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The president has been a vocal opponent of the Black Lives Matter
protests against police brutality that have been held across the nation
since late May, calling the movement a “symbol of hate.” He has
criticized so-called cancel culture, defended the Confederate flag and
military bases named for Confederate generals, and accused people of
trying to “erase” American history.

“It has come to the president’s attention that executive branch agencies
have spent millions of taxpayer dollars to date ‘training’ government
workers to believe divisive, anti-American propaganda,” Mr. Vought
wrote.

“For example, according to press reports, employees across the executive
branch have been required to attend trainings where they are told that
‘virtually all white people contribute to racism’ or where they are
required to say that they ‘benefit from racism,’” he wrote.

Again, citing news reports, Mr. Vought said that some of the training
sessions had “further claimed that there is racism embedded in the
belief that America is the land of opportunity or the belief that the
most qualified person should receive a job.”

“These types of ‘trainings’ not only run counter to the fundamental
beliefs for which our nation has stood since its inception, but they
also engender division and resentment within the federal work force,”
Mr. Vought wrote.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

He said that Mr. Trump had directed him “to ensure that federal agencies
cease and desist from using taxpayer dollars to fund these divisive,
un-American propaganda training sessions.”

Additional guidance on the president’s directive will be issued soon,
Mr. Vought said.

Officials declined to say what prompted the memo or which “press
reports” Mr. Vought was referring to.

But on Fox News, which the president digests with gusto despite
criticizing its content, there have been segments denigrating the type
of training sessions that the memo focuses on.
