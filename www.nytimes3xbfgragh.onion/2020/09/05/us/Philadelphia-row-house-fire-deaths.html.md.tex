A woman, a teenager and two children were found dead in a fire at a
Philadelphia rowhouse on Saturday morning, the authorities said.

The victims were discovered after firefighters entered the home while it
was still burning, said the city's fire commissioner, Adam Thiel.

The medical examiner has yet to confirm the causes of the deaths. The
medical examiner's office declined to comment.

The woman, who was 35 years old, was found downstairs in the home, a
spokesman for the Philadelphia Police Department said.

Two boys, 9 and 17, and an 11-year-old girl were found in the upper
level of the home, the police said. The victims were pronounced dead at
the scene a little after 8 a.m.

Commissioner Thiel said firefighters responded to a call about the fire
shortly before 8 a.m. and encountered heavy fire and smoke from the
first and second floors. Firefighters were alerted that there were
people trapped inside, he said at a news conference on Saturday.

``The level of fire spread happened very fast, apparently,'' he said.

The cause of the fire is not yet clear and fire marshals are
investigating, the commissioner said.
