The authorities rescued numerous people from the waters of Lake Travis
in Texas on Saturday after at least four boats sank at an event promoted
as a Trump Boat Parade, officials said.

The Sheriff’s Office in Travis County received “multiple” calls of boats
in distress starting at 12:15 p.m. local time, a spokeswoman, Kristen
Dark, said.

Christa Stedman, a spokeswoman for Austin-Travis County Emergency
Medical Services, said no injuries had been reported.

Firefighters pulled “numerous” people out of the water, said Braden
Frame, president of the Lake Travis Fire Fighters Association. It was
not clear how many had needed rescuing, he said.

The number of boats participating in the gathering was not immediately
clear. Ms. Dark said there were “too many variables” to say for sure
what exactly happened.

“We had an exceptional number of boats on the lake today,” she said.
“When they all started moving at the same time, it generated
significant waves.”

With winds around 10 miles an hour, and gusting to as much as 15 m.p.h.,
the weather conditions in and around the lake most likely would not have
caused the boats to sink, Aaron Treadway, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service in the Austin/San Antonio office, said.

Mr. Frame praised the work of emergency responders, noting that the
rescuers had faced “significant challenges due to the amount of waves
and chop on the water today.”

“We train for water rescues regularly, but this is the first
multi-vessel, multi-incident water rescue that we’ve responded to not
precipitated by a collision,” he said.

Steve Salinas, 42, said that the water had been choppy and the swells
had been high when he went to launch his 22-foot boat, decorated with
eight-foot-tall flagpoles.

Mr. Salinas, who helped organize the event, which was called the Lake
Travis Trump Boat Parade and was [organized on
Facebook](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/events/3308504859200726/?active_tab=about),
said the boat parade was “one way that Trump supporters can get out and
express themselves without causing too much trouble or congestion in
streets.”

Mr. Salinas said he had seen boats of all sizes Saturday — from 60-foot
yachts to eight-foot boats. Mixed with the number of boats headed in the
same direction, their various sizes and the choppy water, Mr. Salinas
said, accidents were bound to happen.

“You can have really great water one second, and it could get some
pretty heavy swells in a matter of minutes,” he said. “Once boats get on
a lake, mother nature has its own plans.”

Boaters were set to travel around the lake, which is about 15 miles
northwest of Austin, at 10 miles per hour, according to the event’s
page.

Other boat parades to display support for President Trump have taken
place this summer.

In Oregon, a boat sank after it was swamped by waves from a passing boat
parade, [The Oregonian
reported](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/boat-sinks-on-willamette-river-as-trump-boat-parade-passes-by.html).
The people on the boat, which was not involved in the parade, were not
injured.

Another parade, the Nation’s Capital Trumptilla Boat Parade and Rally,
is
[planned](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/events/735121180393420/?active_tab=about)
for Sunday on the Potomac River.
