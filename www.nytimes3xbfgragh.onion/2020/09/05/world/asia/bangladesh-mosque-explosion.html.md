An explosion on Friday night at a mosque near Bangladesh’s capital,
believed to have been caused by a gas leak, killed at least 16
worshipers and left 21 with burns so severe that the death toll could
rise further, according to a police officer and a doctor treating some
of the victims.

Gas from an underground pipeline may have leaked into the Baitus Salat
Jame mosque in Narayanganj, just outside Dhaka. The mosque had been
experiencing power outages and as the electricity surged back on, sparks
from air conditioning units may have ignited fumes.

The mosque was crowded at the time with dozens of people in the
two-story building. At about 8:30 p.m., several blasts shook the mosque
and a fire broke out. At least one young child was among the dead.

“From witness accounts, we know that all six air-conditioners on the
ground floor of the mosque exploded simultaneously,” said Aslam Hossain,
a police officer. “Only one or two worshipers were able to escape from
the mosque, the rest were burned inside the mosque.”

Faulty gas pipelines and shoddy cylinders often lead to deaths in
Bangladesh, where regulations are weak and inspections are infrequent.
Two separate accidents involving gas cylinders killed at least two
people in July and August. Last fall, seven children died after a gas
cylinder used for inflating balloons exploded in Dhaka.

Photos showed the mosque’s white air conditioning units browned, gnarled
and sagging, partially melted from the flames. Authorities are still
investigating the cause of the blast. But Mr. Hossain said “we have come
to know that there were leakages in the gas pipeline underneath the
mosque.”

By Saturday morning, many of the survivors were fighting for their
lives.

“They have major burns. Their bodies are nearly fully burned and their
airways are also burned badly,” said Dr. Samanta Lal Sen, the national
coordinator for Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic
Surgery in Dhaka, where some victims were being treated. “It will be
very challenging to save them,” he added.

Rubel Hossain said on Saturday that his niece had lost her 6-year-old
son in the blast and her husband was being treated for burns. The niece
told her uncle that the boy had asked to watch cartoons on television
but she had told him to go to the mosque with his father first.

“She has stopped talking. She has refrained from eating and drinking
since last night,” Mr. Hossain said. “She said, ‘If I had not sent my
son to the mosque, he would not have had to die.’”

Julfikar Ali Manik reported from Dhaka, Bangladesh and Maria Abi-Habib
reported from Los Angeles, California.
