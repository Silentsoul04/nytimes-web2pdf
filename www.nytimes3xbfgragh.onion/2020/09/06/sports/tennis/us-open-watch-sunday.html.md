**How to watch:** From 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time on ESPN2;
streaming on the ESPN app.

On Sunday, the severely thinned ranks of the singles draw will begin the
fourth round of the United States Open with 75 percent of the field
knocked out. While some of the betting favorites are still cruising,
there are plenty of speed bumps to overcome as the knockout format
causes players on hot streaks to collide.

## Here are some matches to keep an eye on.

*Because of the number of matches cycling through courts, the times for
individual matchups are best estimates and are certain to fluctuate
based on the completion times of earlier play. All times are Eastern.*

Arthur Ashe Stadium | 10 p.m.

### <span>**Naomi Osaka vs. Anett Kontaveit**</span>

Osaka, the 2018 U.S. Open champion, seemed frustrated at times during
her third-round victory over Marta Kostyuk. While dealing with hamstring
concerns, Osaka has seemed to oscillate between being in complete
control of her points and sitting back entirely and hoping her opponents
will play themselves into a mistake. As the tournament continues, it
will be interesting to see if Osaka can stay sharp, as she did in a
dominant second-round win over Caroline Garcia.

Kontaveit, the 14th seed, has been consistent through her last two
rounds, winning both easily in straight sets after struggling to win her
first-round match over Danielle Collins. Kontaveit, of Estonia, reached
the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in January but will have a hard
time matching that feat against Osaka. Kontaveit’s variety of play will
be her main weapon here. If she can throw off Osaka’s rhythm, she’ll
still have a chance to upset the former champion.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Arthur Ashe Stadium | 7 p.m.

### <span>**Denis Shapovalov vs. David Goffin**</span>

Goffin, the seventh seed, can be described simply as a consistency
player. On the court, he has the tendency to make his opponents hit just
one more ball than they’re comfortable with, leading them into unforced
errors. Goffin has also shown his consistency in his results, finishing
his U.S. Open runs in the fourth round for the last three years. Now,
having reached the round of 16 once again, he’ll be trying to make his
first quarterfinal in Flushing Meadows by outlasting an in-form
Shapovalov.

Although Shapovalov has been impressive throughout this tournament,
reaching only his second round of 16 at a major tournament, he struggled
to put away Taylor Fritz during a five-set contest in the third round on
Friday. His aggressive style, heralded by a powerful and
pinpoint-accurate backhand, makes him an exciting player to watch. The
open question is whether or not he’ll have the energy to hit ball after
ball to the indefatigable Goffin. Shapovalov has spent 10 hours on court
this week, not counting his doubles matches, and the wear and tear of
the longer Grand Slam formats may make it hard for him to deliver the
same performances going into the second week.

Louis Armstrong Stadium | 11 a.m.

### <span>**Jennifer Brady vs. Angelique Kerber**</span>

Brady, the 28th seed, has reached the round of 16 at a Grand Slam event
for the first time since 2017. Although Brady has been successful
primarily on the doubles court, her run this year has been impressive.
She has yet to drop a set at the U.S. Open in singles, and across three
matches, she has only lost 14 games. However, she will face a much more
difficult test in her first seeded player of the tournament, Kerber.

Kerber, a three-time major champion, including a 2016 U.S. Open title,
has also looked as if she is at the top of her game. Although she has
lost more games on her path to the round of 16, she has demonstrated
that her counterpunch groundstrokes still have the capacity to overwhelm
opponents. A former world No. 1, Kerber has not been past the round of
16 at a major event since her championship performance at Wimbledon in
2018. On current form, she has every right to feel confident that she
can push for another Grand Slam title.

Louis Armstrong Stadium | 6 p.m.

### <span>**Borna Coric vs. Jordan Thompson**</span>

Thompson, the world No. 63, will play in his first round of 16 match at
a major tournament. Before Sunday, he had never been past the second
round of a hardcourt major, and it will be interesting to see if the
absence of fans at the U.S. Open helps ameliorate the nerves that
players can feel upon their first time breaking into the second week at
a Grand Slam.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Coric, the 27th seed, pulled off a remarkable five-set upset over
fourth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. Coric faced six match points in the
fourth set, but with a mix of patience and guile, he was able to push
past Tsitsipas into the round of 16. Coric’s defensive style of play can
be difficult to execute on faster hardcourts, but he adjusted well,
taking more risks and coming into the net to put pressure on his
opponent. If he’s able to physically recover from his late-night
marathon, he should be able to execute again and push past Thompson.

## Other important matches:

  - Rajeev Ram/Joe Salisbury versus Mackenzie McDonald/Christopher
    Eubanks, Court 17 | 11 a.m.

  - Yulia Putintseva versus Petra Martic, Arthur Ashe Stadium | Noon

    Stadium | 1 p.m.

  - Novak Djokovic versus Pablo Carreño Busta, Arthur Ashe Stadium | 2
    p.m.
