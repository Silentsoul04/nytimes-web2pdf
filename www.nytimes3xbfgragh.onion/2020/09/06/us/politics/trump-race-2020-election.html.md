WASHINGTON — After a summer when hundreds of thousands of people took to
the streets protesting racial injustice against Black Americans,
[President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html)
has made it clear over the last few days that, in his view, the
country’s real race problem is bias against white Americans.

Just days after returning from Kenosha, Wis., where he [staunchly backed
law
enforcement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/politics/trump-conspiracy-theory-thugs-plane.html)
and did not mention the name of Jacob Blake, the Black man shot seven
times in the back by the police, [Mr. Trump issued an
order](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/politics/trump-race-sensitivity-training.html)
on Friday to purge the federal government of racial sensitivity training
that his White House called “divisive, anti-American propaganda.”

The president then spent much of the weekend tweeting about his action,
presenting himself as a warrior against identity politics. “This is a
sickness that cannot be allowed to continue,” [he wrote of such
programs](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1302212909808971776).
“Please report any sightings so we can quickly extinguish\!” He
[reposted a
tweet](https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/1302214228527456264)
from a conservative outlet hailing his order: “Sorry liberals\! How to
be Anti-White 101 is permanently cancelled\!”

Not in generations has a sitting president so overtly declared himself
the candidate of white America. While Mr. Trump’s campaign sought to
temper the culture war messaging at the Republican National Convention
last month by [showcasing Black and Hispanic supporters who denied that
he is a
racist](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/29/us/politics/rnc-trump-race-gender.html),
the president himself has increasingly made appeals to the grievances of
white supporters a centerpiece of his campaign to win a second term.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The message appears designed to galvanize supporters who have cheered
what they see as a defiant stand against political correctness since the
days when he kicked off his last presidential campaign in 2015 by
denouncing, without evidence, Mexicans crossing the border as “rapists.”
While he initially voiced concern over [the killing of George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html)
under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis this spring,
which touched off nationwide protests, he has focused since then almost
entirely on defending the police and condemning demonstrations during
which there have been outbreaks of looting and violence.

He has described American cities as hotbeds of chaos, [played to
“suburban
housewives”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/30/upshot/trump-suburban-voters.html)
he casts as fearful of low-income people moving into their
neighborhoods, [sought to block a move — backed by the Pentagon and
Republican
lawmakers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/politics/trump-rejects-renaming-military-bases.html)
— to rename Army bases named for Confederate generals, [criticized
NASCAR](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-bubba-wallace-nascar.html)
for banning the Confederate flag, called Black Lives Matter a “symbol of
hate” and vowed to strip funding from cities that do not take what he
deems tough enough action against protesters.

In effect, he is reaching out to a subset of white voters who think the
news media and political elites see Trump supporters as inherently
racist. Mr. Trump has repeatedly rejected the notion that America has a
problem with systemic racial bias, dismissing instances of police
brutality against Black Americans as the work of a few “bad apples,” in
his words.

“Trump is the most extreme, and he has done something that is beyond the
bounds of anything we have seen,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “Playing with racism is a
dangerous game. It’s not that you can do it a little bit or do it slyly
or do it with a dog whistle. It’s all dangerous, and it’s all
potentially violent.”

Aides said Mr. Trump’s actions were aimed at
eliminating<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> ﻿</span>pernicious views
that actually exacerbate prejudice. “President Trump believes that all
men and women are created equal, and he will stand against anti-American
philosophies of all kinds that promote racial division,” Kayleigh
McEnany, the White House press secretary, said on Sunday.

Public views of Mr. Trump flow through a racial prism. [A poll by CBS
News](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmvwY-EJIMWKveUWPTdpx_-JL6VTqCcx/view)
last week found that 66 percent of registered voters believed Mr. Trump
favored white people, versus 4 percent who said he worked against their
interests. By contrast, 20 percent thought he favored Black people and
50 percent said he worked against Black people. Among Black voters, 81
percent said he worked against their interests.

In the poll, Mr. Trump led former Vice President [Joseph R. Biden
Jr.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html),
his Democratic challenger, among white voters by 51 percent to 43
percent, but trailed among Black voters with just 9 percent support,
compared with 85 percent for Mr. Biden. Among Hispanic voters, Mr. Biden
led by 63 percent to 25 percent.

The president’s latest order came as a [book to be published on Tuesday
by Michael D.
Cohen](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/06/us/politics/cohen-book-trump.html),
his former lawyer and fixer, describes a dismissive attitude toward
nonwhite voters during the 2016 campaign. They were “not my people,” Mr.
Cohen quotes Mr. Trump as saying. “I will never get the Hispanic vote,”
Mr. Trump added, according to the book. “Like the Blacks, they’re too
stupid to vote for Trump.”

The president’s approach in recent days seems to belie the Republican
convention programming that sought to soften his image on race by
featuring validators like Herschel Walker, the onetime football star,
and Vernon Jones, a Black Democratic state legislator from Georgia, who
testified to Mr. Trump’s friendship and support for people of all races.

The president often makes the unfounded assertion that he has done more
for Black Americans than any president other perhaps than Abraham
Lincoln. He cites his [support for funding for historically Black
colleges and
universities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/10/us/politics/trump-black-colleges.html),
his signature on [legislation overhauling criminal justice
sentencing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/01/us/politics/first-step-act-donald-trump.html)
and an unemployment rate for Black people that dropped to record lows on
his watch, continuing a trend that had begun under his predecessor,
until it rose again with the pandemic-related economic slowdown.

But analysts said the convention had been aimed at making it easier for
white voters uncomfortable with Mr. Trump’s history on race to support
him and that it might have appealed to nonwhite voters who bristle at
the so-called cancel culture that has become a favorite target of the
right.

Like other policies put forth with little advance notice, Mr. Trump’s
focus on diversity training seems to have originated with something he
saw on Fox News. On Tuesday night, Tucker Carlson interviewed
Christopher F. Rufo, a conservative scholar at the Discovery Institute
who criticized what he called the “cult indoctrination” of “critical
race theory” programs in the government.

“It’s absolutely astonishing how critical race theory has pervaded every
institution in the federal government, and what I’ve discovered is that
critical race theory has become in essence the default ideology of the
federal bureaucracy and is now being weaponized against the American
people,” Mr. Rufo said on the program.

On his website, Mr. Rufo identified six agencies that had conducted
training sessions that he said asserted that America is inherently
racist and promoted concepts like unconscious bias, white privilege and
white fragility. At the Treasury Department, for instance, he said
employees had been told that “virtually all white people contribute to
racism” and that white staff members should “struggle to own their
racism.”

Mr. Trump’s memo on Friday adopted much of this language, attributing it
to “press reports.” The memo, signed by Russell T. Vought, the director
of the Office of Management and Budget, said “this divisive, false, and
demeaning propaganda of the critical race theory movement is contrary to
all we stand for as Americans and should have no place in the Federal
government.”

Mr. Trump wrote or reposted roughly 20 Twitter messages about the memo
on Saturday and on Sunday said [the Education Department would
investigate](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1302586046551597061)
schools that use curriculum from the 1619 Project by The New York Times
Magazine, an effort to look at American history through the frame of
slavery’s consequences and the contributions of Black Americans.

Critics said the president’s move was a transparent play for white votes
with less than two months until the Nov. 3 election.

“To say antiracism is anti-American is to say racism is American, which
is to say Trump wants white Americans to be racist,” said Ibram X.
Kendi, the author of “How to Be an Anti-Racist” and director of the
Boston University Center for Antiracist Research. “And that’s precisely
the point. He’s relying on manipulating the racist fears of white voters
to win them over. Once white people lose those fears through
interventions like trainings, Trump loses their votes.”

Mr. Rufo, though, said on Sunday that Mr. Trump was pitting his America
First narrative celebrating the nation’s heritage against what he called
the Black Lives Matter narrative that America was founded on racism.
“The president is framing the election for voters in these terms,” he
said. “Do they want to preserve the American way of life or do they want
to burn it down?”
