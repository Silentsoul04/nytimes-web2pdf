\section{Taylor Swift's `Folklore' Still No. 1, Six Weeks
Later}\label{taylor-swifts-folklore-still-no-1-six-weeks-later}}

It's the longest streak at the top of the Billboard chart for any album
since Drake's ``Views'' in 2016.

In April, as the pandemic brought the concert industry to a halt, Taylor
Swift canceled all her tour dates for the year. ``I'm so sad I won't be
able to see you guys in concert this year, but I know this is the right
decision,''
\href{https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1251193743912456192}{she
wrote on Twitter}, giving her fans no indication they would see her
again, in any form, until 2021.

Three months later,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review.html}{she
emerged from quarantine with ``Folklore,''} a classic
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/07/01/insider/covering-beyonce-everything-is-love.html}{surprise
release} that has dominated the Billboard album chart this summer. Now
it is in its sixth week at No. 1, the longest streak at the top of the
chart for any album since
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/05/10/arts/music/drake-views-billboard-sales.html}{Drake's
``Views''} four years ago.

In its sixth week out,
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review.html}{Folklore}''
had the equivalent of 90,000 album sales in the United States, including
streams as well as copies sold as a complete package. After selling 17
physical versions of the album through her website for the first two
weeks, Swift has lately been surprising fans by sending
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/arts/music/taylor-swift-folklore-billboard.html}{autographed
copies} of the CD to indie record stores.

In the United States, ``Folklore'' has sold 860,000 copies of its
complete album version --- counting downloads as well as its various
physical versions ---~and nearly 700 million streams. Around the world,
the album is ``nearing'' two billion streams, according to Swift's
label, Republic, a division of the giant Universal Music Group.

Also this week, Metallica opens at No. 4 with ``S\&M2,'' a live album
recorded with the San Francisco Symphony, and Katy Perry's new album,
``Smile,'' starts at No. 5. Two posthumous rap albums hold their
positions just below ``Folklore'': Pop Smoke's ``Shoot for the Stars Aim
for the Moon'' is No. 2 and Juice WRLD's ``Legends Never Die'' is No. 3.
