# Xi’s Post-Virus Economic Strategy for China Looks Inward

He [inspected fields of

amid jitters about food supplies. He visited steel works trying to
overcome a slump in profits. He toured an innovation center at a time
when [President Trump has raised
barriers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/23/business/trump-technology-china-trade.html)
against China’s technological takeoff.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has used his recent trips to highlight a
warning: The country must retool its economy to be more self-sustaining
in a post-pandemic world of uncertainty, weakened demand and hostility.

China needs its people to spend more and its manufacturers to be more
innovative, Mr. Xi has said, to ease dependence on fickle foreign
economies. Most pressing, [official media
comments](http://news.youth.cn/sz/202008/t20200804_12436479.htm) on Mr.
Xi’s strategy have said, China must be ready for sustained acrimony with
the United States that could [put at
risk](http://sky.cssn.cn/skyskl/skyskl_jczx/202008/t20200826_5174247.shtml)
its access to American consumers, investors and know-how.

“The world has entered a period of turbulence and transformation,” Mr.
Xi [told an audience of prominent Chinese
economists](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2020-08/24/c_1126407763.htm)
brought to the Communist Party’s headquarters in central Beijing late
last month. “We face an external environment with even more headwinds
and countercurrents.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China must “make breakthroughs in core technologies as quickly as
possible,” Mr. Xi said.

Mr. Xi has called his new initiative a “dual circulation” strategy. The
grandly technocratic name, which he [first
used](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2020-05/14/c_1125986000.htm)
in May, means China should rely on a robust cycle of domestic demand and
innovation as the main driver of the economy while maintaining foreign
markets and investors as a second engine of growth.

To some, Mr. Xi’s latest initiative looks like a glossy reboot of
longstanding efforts to overhaul the Chinese economy. Chinese leaders
[have
promised](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-03/02/content_818091_4.htm)
since at least 2006 to make domestic consumer spending a bigger share of
economic activity, reducing reliance on exports and infrastructure
building — with mixed success.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

But Mr. Xi’s new strategy demands to be taken seriously, even if its
implications are still hazy. He has cast it as a security imperative to
keep China growing in an era of global turbulence, and that new
geopolitical urgency will raise pressure on officials to show results.

“This policy has a lot to do with China’s changing international
environment, particularly the deterioration of Sino-American relations,”
[Yao Yang](https://en.nsd.pku.edu.cn/faculty/fulltime/y/239558.htm), the
dean of the National School of Development at Peking University, said in
an emailed response to questions. “China needs to prepare for the

areas.”

Chinese officials and experts have already been rushing out rival
proposals to flesh out Mr. Xi’s strategy. Some have urged the government
to [ramp up support](https://www.sohu.com/a/414506166_729263) for
Chinese technology companies. Others have [called for reducing
barriers](http://www.aisixiang.com/data/122269.html)to foreign
investors, to help ensure that China keeps its friends and is not cut
off.

China’s formula for growth has been evolving, though in the view of some
economists, too slowly. Exports contribute notably less to economic
growth than they did a decade ago, but the [shift to domestic
consumption has been
incremental](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/11/12/Chinas-Rebalancing-Recent-Progress-Prospects-and-Policies-46291).
And China depends on imports of technology, crops and energy, adding to
the government’s worries about external vulnerability.

“Frankly, a succession of policies from the Trump administration have
made us see the importance of this more clearly,” Yu Yongding, an
economist in Beijing who previously advised China’s central bank, said
in a telephone interview, referring to Mr. Xi’s new emphasis on domestic
consumption. “We may step up the pace of our adjustment.”

Mr. Xi has said that dual circulation will shape China’s [next five-year
development
plan](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/27/c_139320265.htm),
which will be largely finalized later this year and rolled out next
year. A Communist Party leaders’ meeting [in
October](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/31/c_139252599.htm) is
likely to reveal more of what Mr. Xi has in mind for that plan and
beyond.

The leaders will be sorting through competing proposals on how to meet
Mr. Xi’s goals as they hammer together the five-year plan. Central to
their deliberations is how China should handle restrictions by the
United States and other advanced economies that have become increasingly
frustrated by and wary of China.

In the end, Mr. Xi’s preference for state dominance is likely to
determine what proposals become policy.

“I do think that China is preparing for an even further degree of
decoupling,” [Zhu
Ning](http://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/zhu-ning), a deputy
dean at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, said in an
interview. “In most of the propaganda, the domestic consumption cycle
receives far more attention than the foreign cycle.”

Mr. Xi’s recent itinerary reflects the broader strategy he is mapping
for China while the United States and other Western powers remain
largely consumed with the coronavirus
crisis.

Inspecting the flat, fertile farmland of northeast China in late July,
he [spoke of](http://jhsjk.people.cn/article/31797420) ensuring that the
country could feed itself. In Anhui Province in central China, he
visited [a tech innovation
center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzwkIJt3jTE&t=1048s) with
displays of “quantum security” mobile phones, microchips and other
symbols of homegrown technological prowess.

China faces an “external environment where the global market is
shrinking,” Mr. Xi said while visiting Anhui, [according to the People’s
Daily](http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0824/c1001-31833325.html),
the party’s main newspaper. China’s exports [have
rebounded](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/business/chinas-exports-rise-despite-the-virus-surprising-economists.html)
from the shock of the first months of the pandemic, but Mr. Xi suggested
that the longer-term outlook was uncertain.

China’s stepped up effort to remake its economy was a “long-term
strategic move,” he said, as if to pre-empt any doubt about his resolve.

Mr. Xi’s program is likely to bring more measures to support domestic
service industries, such as tourism, and more support for new energy
sources to displace imports, [Wang
Wen](http://en.rdcy.org/indexen/index/leader_cont/pid/692/id/14791.html),
executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, a think
tank in Beijing, said in an interview. He said that the new strategy
implied a more ambitious agenda than just expanding consumer spending.

To increase domestic consumption, the Chinese government would have to
[markedly reduce
inequality](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/world/europe/thomas-piketty-china.html)
by shifting wealth to ordinary households. Poorer people are unlikely to
spend freely when they lack disposable income and tend to save money for
emergencies.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That could require difficult social and economic changes that have met
official resistance. Mr. Xi’s new edict has also revived decades-long
calls for [breaking down bureaucratic
barriers](https://finance.sina.com.cn/review/hgds/2020-08-19/doc-iivhuipn9395668.shtml)
that make it difficult for rural residents working in cities to get
medical care or send their children to schools.

“Any efforts to reduce inequality would, in theory at least, translate
into higher domestic consumption,” [Jane
Golley](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/golley-je), an
economist at the Australian National University in Canberra, said by
telephone. “The failings that they’ve had there is part of the reason
that they’ve struggled to see a significant boost in the share of
consumption.”

Mr. Xi’s dual circulation initiative may have a more immediate impact by
redoubling efforts to build homegrown technology and reduce China’s need
for foreign-made microchips and other key components in smartphones,
computers and other equipment.

Many Chinese officials and analysts say that American enmity has
compelled Beijing to spend more on creating its own crucial
technologies. In the latest blow, the Trump administration
[announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/technology/trump-huawei-commerce-chips.html)
in August that it was restricting the ability of Huawei, the Chinese
telecommunications equipment giant, to buy chips made or designed with
American equipment and software.

The new strategy does not mean that Beijing is closing the door on
foreign investors and markets, [Chinese officials
assert](http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2020-08/24/c_1126407763.htm),
and experts say that a rupture with the United States would be
economically devastating for both sides.

A debate has emerged about how China should balance strengthening its
economic fortifications while keeping access to foreign markets.

Professor Yu, the economist in Beijing, set off controversy by [arguing
last month that Mr. Xi’s new
initiative](https://new.qq.com/omn/20200819/20200819A0CBG700.html)
should include revamping “Made in China 2025,” a program to support
domestic manufacturing that other governments criticized as unfair. In
the interview, Mr. Yu said that he was not arguing for state-driven
industrial planning, and wanted commercial investment to drive the
effort.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A push for technological independence could further alarm those in the
West who have worried that China has turned its back on Deng Xiaoping’s
era of “reform and opening up.”

“Those hawks would say: ‘See, we were right about China’s state
capitalism,’” Professor Yao of Peking University said, adding that he
believed that China and the United States could resolve disputes over
technological rivalry through negotiation.

Mr. Xi often orchestrates policy drives by first issuing sweeping
commands, leaving subordinates to hammer out detailed proposals. In
2015, he launched “[supply-side structural
reform](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/03/04/world/asia/xi-jinping-china-economic-policy.html)”
to cut bloated industrial capacity, and it evolved from a catchphrase to
a campaign that [bore

“The leadership doesn’t issue slogans like these because they think
things will be easy. They issue them to force focus, mobilization and
prioritization,” [Julian
Gewirtz](https://www.cfr.org/expert/julian-gewirtz), a senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations who studies Chinese politics, said by
email. “Dual circulation has a lot of mileage left to go before it’s
towed off to the junkyard of discarded slogans.”
