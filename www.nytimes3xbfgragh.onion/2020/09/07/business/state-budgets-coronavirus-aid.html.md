Alaska chopped resources for public broadcasting. [New York
City](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/overview-residents-organics)
gutted a nascent [composting
program](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/overview-residents-organics)
that could have kept tons of food waste out of landfills. New Jersey

Prisoners in

will continue to swelter in their cells, because plans to air-condition
its prisons are on hold. Many states have already cut planned raises for
teachers.

And that’s just the start.

Across the nation, states and cities have made an [array of fiscal
maneuvers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/business/virus-state-budgets.html)
to stay solvent and are planning more in case Congress can’t agree on a
fiscal relief package after the August recess.

House Democrats included nearly $1 trillion in state and local aid in
the [relief
bill](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr6800/BILLS-116hr6800ih.pdf)
they passed in May, but the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, has said he doesn’t want to hand out a “blank check” to pay
for what he considers fiscal mismanagement, including the enormous
public-pension obligations some states have accrued. There has been
little movement in that stalemate lately.

Economists warn that further state spending reductions could prolong the
downturn by shaking the confidence of residents, whose day-to-day lives
depend heavily on state and local services.

“People look to government as their backstop when things are completely
falling apart,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
“If they feel like there’s no support there, they lose faith and they
run for the bunker and pull back on everything.”

States and municipalities are also crucial employers and spenders that
keep the economy moving. “We run the risk of descending into a dark
vicious cycle,” Mr. Zandi
said.

State and local governments administer most of America’s programs for
education, public safety, health care and unemployment insurance. They
also provide a wide variety of smaller services, such as outdoor
recreational facilities or highway rest stops, that improve the quality
of life. The costs of many of these programs have spiraled because of
the pandemic, which has at the same time caused an economic slump that
has driven down tax revenues.

Collectively, state governments will have budget shortfalls of $312
billion through the summer of 2022, according to a review by Moody’s
Analytics. When local governments are factored in, the shortfall rises
to $500 billion. That estimate assumes the pandemic doesn’t get worse.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When the lockdowns started in March, state and local governments quickly
cut 1.3 million jobs. But then they paused, waiting to see if revenue
would continue to fall — and what Washington might do to replace it.

Lawmakers soon passed the $2 trillion [CARES
Act](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html),
which authorized one-time stimulus payments and temporary supplemental
unemployment payments, which buoyed consumer spending and helped states’
sales-tax revenues. The law also allocated about $150 billion to states
for expenses directly attributable to the pandemic, in areas ranging
from education and health care to the operation of nearly empty
airports. But the rules for what expenses that money can cover have kept
much of it from being spent, according to the [Treasury
Department](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Interim-Report-of-Costs-by-Category-Incurred-by-State-and-Local-Recipients-through-June-30.pdf).
New York State, for example, has been sent about $2.9 billion that it
can’t put toward other uses.

Although states’ budget challenges would be eased if Congress relaxed
those rules, that still wouldn’t be enough to fill the gap.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has warned that without further relief New York
will cut $8.2 billion in grants to local governments, a blow he said had
“no precedent in modern times.” The cuts would hit “nearly every
activity funded by state government,” including special education,
pediatric health care, substance abuse programs, property-tax relief and
mass transit, he said.

No two states have tackled the budget crunch the same way. Several have
torn up their annual budgets and are doling out money to programs one or
two months at a time. Some have earmarked cuts but not yet carried them
out.

Delaware has decided to issue less debt, and a bond issue that was
supposed to fund clean-water projects has been shelved. In California,
people who go to court without lawyers — an estimated 4.3 million a year
— will continue to deal with confusion because the state has scrapped
plans for “court navigators” to shepherd them through.
[Nevada](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/nevada-legislature-makes-small-progress-on-budget-gap-2074754/)
said it would forgo the penalties and interest it normally charged tax
cheats, hoping to coax them and their unpaid millions up from
underground. In Maryland, the [Baltimore Symphony
Orchestra](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/17/arts/music/baltimore-symphony-musicians-lock-out.html)
will lose a $1.6 million state subsidy.

Some states are trying to save cash on their pension contributions.
Kentucky has delayed its payments to the state workers’ pension fund,
already one of the most poorly funded in the country. Colorado and
Maryland are among the states planning to reduce their contributions.
Some, like California and New Jersey, had recently committed to raising
their contributions to cover past underpayments — but now can’t afford
to do so.

Without further federal aid, some of the biggest cuts will be to
education and health care. California says it will send its school
districts $12.5 billion in I.O.U.s if Washington doesn’t step in, and it
will be on the schools to figure out how to fund themselves in the
meantime. Preschool programs are being cut in many states; so are
free-tuition college programs. State university systems are slated to
lose billions of dollars in state funding, although some states say the
cuts will be quickly reversed if enough federal money arrives.

And many states say they will reduce their outlays for Medicaid. The
health care program for low-income people has been growing rapidly in
the pandemic as millions have lost their jobs along with their employee
health benefits. States are struggling to find a way to pay for all
these additional people. Some, like Colorado, are increasing the
co-payments that their Medicaid patients must pay for doctor visits,
pharmaceuticals and medical
transport.

State officials say they have little choice but to keep cutting if more
aid doesn’t arrive. All but one state, Vermont, are legally bound to
balance their budgets every year, and Vermont does so voluntarily. They
can’t borrow their way out of a cash crunch, the way Washington can,
because they have laws limiting how much bond debt they can carry. If
they veer too close to the limit, lenders will start demanding higher
interest rates and the rating agencies will downgrade them.

In May, the [Federal
Reserve](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/fed-expands-municipal-bond-program.html)
offered to buy states’ bonds if terms in the municipal bond market
become onerous. But most states think the Fed loans cost too much and
have to be paid back too quickly to be of much help. So far only one
state, Illinois, and one state authority, New York’s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, have taken the Fed up on its offer. New Jersey
and Hawaii are exploring deals, according to the National Conference of
State Legislatures, which tracks the states’ fiscal plans as they
develop.

Public pensions have been a central point of contention in discussions
over additional federal aid.

In April, with economic activity at low ebb, Illinois lawmakers sent [a
detailed wish
list](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/business/dealbook/illinois-pension-coronavirus.html)to
their state’s congressional delegation that included $10 billion for the
coming year’s pension contribution. They also asked for $9.6 billion for
Illinois’s cities, which needed the money to “fund retirement systems
for the police, firefighters and other first responders providing
emergency services during this Covid-19 outbreak.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The request drew scorn in Washington.

On a syndicated radio show, Mr. McConnell said Senate Republicans would
“certainly insist that anything we’d borrow to send down to the states
is not spent on solving problems that they created for themselves over
the years with their pension programs.”

Glenn Hubbard, an economic conservative who was chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, said he agreed that
federal money should not be used to prop up failing state pension funds.
But he acknowledged that the states’ cash needs were becoming urgent and
said there wasn’t time for a complete overhaul of troubled state pension
systems.

For the sake of speed, Mr. Hubbard said in an interview, Congress could
send the states money with a simple, and probably breakable, rule that
it not be used to reduce taxes or bail out pensions. Public pension
reform, which would be grueling, could come later.

Or, as Mr. Hubbard said in an online seminar hosted by the Economic
Policy Institute last month, “if an overweight person comes to the E.R.
with a heart attack, you treat the heart attack before you lecture him
or her about weight.”
