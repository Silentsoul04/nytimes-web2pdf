You think baking is demanding when it comes to precision? Try mixing a
drink. \href{https://www.cocktailkingdom.com/}{Cocktail Kingdom}, a
company that sells everything you need for your bar but the booze, has
introduced a set of six handsome stainless steel measuring spoons
designed by the mixologist Jim Meehan. They go from a quarter-teaspoon
to a tablespoon and include a .06-ounce barspoon, a three-quarters
teaspoon and a half-tablespoon. Each has the amount in ounces and spoons
stamped on the handle, and they're held together with a key ring. Mr.
Meehan said he came up with the set because he wanted tools with more
exact measurements for small amounts. I wish he had included a
half-teaspoon.

Meehan's Mixology Spoons, \$24.99, available starting Sept. 15,
