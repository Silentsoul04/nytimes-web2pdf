The Museum of Food and Drink is offering a rich program of hourlong Zoom
talks addressing cultural and political issues. First up is
``\href{https://www.mofad.org/events/2020/917/eatingnafta}{Eating
NAFTA}: Food Justice, Policy, and the Cuisine of Mexico'' on Sept. 17 at
8 p.m. Led by the author Alyshia Gálvez, with a panel of experts, the
event will address how more fluid trade led to greater availability of
Mexican ingredients north of the border, but shortages and more
industrial farming in Mexico. Then, on Sept. 24 at 8 p.m., the
journalist Simran Sethi will present
``\href{https://www.mofad.org/events/2020/0820/save/savor}{Save/Savor}:
How Our Choice of Chocolate Impacts Biodiversity and Social Justice.''
It will include an option to purchase chocolate bars in advance and
taste them with Ms. Sethi.

``Eating NAFTA,'' \$15; ``Save/Savor,'' \$15 for the session, \$85 for
chocolates sent in advance, \$100 to include Ms. Sethi's book, ``Bread,
Wine, Chocolate: The Slow Loss of Foods We Love,''
