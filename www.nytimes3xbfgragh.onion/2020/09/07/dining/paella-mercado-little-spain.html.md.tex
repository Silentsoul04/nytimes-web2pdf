José Andrés's market in Hudson Yards now sells paella, pan included, for
pickup or delivery, and paella kits for those farther afield.

Paella to go in a proper pan, big enough to serve three or four, is the
latest offering at José Andrés's Spanish market in Hudson Yards. This is
not your usual kitchen-sink paella, but a precise one that features only
imported Mediterranean red shrimp and cuttlefish. It's the first of what
will be a changing array of paellas available at Mercado Little Spain.
For those who are not close enough to the market for pickup or delivery,
there are also paella kits with everything but the fresh ingredients,
available for shipping.

Mercado Little Spain, 10 Hudson Yards (30th Street and 10th Avenue);
paella de gamba roja, \$60 including the paella pan to keep, pickup and
delivery available; paella kit, \$85,
