Gabrielle Hamilton wrote
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/magazine/this-zucchini-tian-is-nonna-inspired-cooking-at-restaurant-speed.html}{a
terrific column} for The Times recently about how hard it is to cook the
food she serves at Prune, her restaurant in the East Village of
Manhattan, as if there weren't line cooks in the kitchen but instead ``a
gentle older woman back there in heavy stockings and a cardigan.''
There's so much about home cooking --- the best cooking! --- that simply
can't be done in a restaurant, for reasons of scale and sanitation,
speed and consistency. I loved the story because for me it's always the
opposite: I go into a restaurant kitchen to report on a recipe, then
it's the devil's work to make the dish possible to cook in a home
kitchen, for the same reasons turned upside down.

The recipe that accompanies her essay is for a
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021395-tian}{zucchini
tian} (above), a sort of prettified ratatouille that Gabrielle learned
from her late ex-mother-in-law, in Puglia, Italy. It is home cooking at
its slow-and-steady finest, even if Gabrielle has successfully made and
served it at Prune (and, as it happens, under the klieg lights of
Kitchen Stadium, where in 2008 she used it to best Bobby Flay on ``Iron
Chef America: Battle Zucchini''). I think it'd be a great dish to cook
this week.

Me, I've been flying solo for a few days, cooking duck legs in a
cast-iron pan under a sprinkle of salt and five-spice powder, eating one
for dinner and the other for lunch the next day, the skin crisped in the
rendered fat and served over baby arugula with toast, then shredded onto
a warm tortilla and drizzled with chile oil. I've done that three days
running now. I'm duck mad.

Tonight, though, I'm thinking Anita Lo's
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019622-cauliflower-chaat-for-one}{cauliflower
chaat for one}, or a souped-up bowl of
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1016583-perfect-instant-ramen}{perfect
ramen}, with butter and a poached egg. Or
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019883-chicken-piccata}{chicken
piccata}? I could go big with that.

And soon enough:
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020979-five-ingredient-creamy-miso-pasta}{creamy
miso pasta};
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1014390-smothered-pork-chops}{smothered
pork chops};
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019804-honey-and-soy-glazed-chicken-thighs}{honey-and-soy-glazed
chicken thighs} --- all my friends.

This week I'd also like to cook in honor of Julia Reed, the vivacious,
funny, irreverent and wise journalist and cook who contributed to The
Times for years, and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/dining/julia-reed-dead.html}{who
died in late August}. Kim Severson wrote a beautiful
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/dining/julia-reed-recipes.html}{introduction
to her recipes} for us, and I'll start with her
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/11404-summer-squash-casserole}{summer
squash casserole}. (And maybe finish with her
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1746-pralines}{pralines}.)

Now, it's nothing to do with coriander or Texas Pete hot sauce, but
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/arts/TV-shows-sports-audiences.html}{Amanda
Hess on what a lack of live audiences has done to the worlds of sports,
politics and comedy} is really smart criticism.

\href{https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2020/08/jesmyn-ward-on-husbands-death-and-grief-during-covid}{Jesmyn
Ward on the death of her husband}, in Vanity Fair? It's heartbreaking.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/arts/music/five-minutes-classical-music-violin.html}{Take
five minutes to fall in love with classical violin music}, please.

Finally, I loved
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/theater/5-miscast-musical-numbers.html}{this
round-up of five ``Miscast'' numbers}, in The Times. Raul Esparza and
Lin-Manuel Miranda singing
``\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOoKi6q9ZXE\&feature=youtu.be}{A
Boy Like That},'' from ``West Side Story''? Yes, please. Listen to that,
and I'll be back on Wednesday.
