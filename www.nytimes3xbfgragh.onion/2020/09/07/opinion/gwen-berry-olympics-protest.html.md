In sports arenas [around the
world](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/12062572/black-lives-matter-england-players-to-take-a-knee-in-nations-league-games),
taking a knee is [no longer
taboo](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kneeling-athletes-anthem-opinion-poll-28-07-2020/)
— it’s trending. But there’s at least one place where protesting is
still not allowed.

The Olympic medal podium.

In the video Op-Ed above, the track and field Olympian Gwen Berry
confronts Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee,
over what she feels is his organization’s hypocrisy: Olympians are
celebrated for their courage, drive and tenacity. But if they are
spurred by those same traits to demand racial justice? That’s a
punishable offense.

On the podium at the 2019 Pan Am Games, Berry raised her fist. Then she
[paid for
it](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/george-floyd-athlete-protest-gwen-berry-1.5593346).
She was reprimanded by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and is
now unsponsored. She is among the top hammer throwers in the world, but
hasn’t received an athletic grant since protesting.

Berry is a Black woman without a safety net defying a global
organization that brought in [$165 million in
profits](https://www.sportbusiness.com/news/ioc-reports-healthy-profit-in-winter-olympics-year/)
in 2018. Yet athletes like her — [who often scrape
by](https://www.fastcompany.com/3062575/olympic-athletes-struggle-financially-while-striving-for-gold)
— are faced with an impossible dilemma: keep their mouths shut or
jeopardize their career to fight for justice.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Berry has fought to get to where she is today. She was raised by her
grandmother in a household of 13 in Ferguson, Mo. After having a son at
age 15, she earned a college scholarship and became a top hammer
thrower. While training to qualify for the Olympics in 2016, she held
down two jobs — working at Dick’s Sporting Goods during the day and
delivering Insomnia Cookies at night — and helped support 10
extended-family members back
home.

Last month, Team USA formed a council to make recommendations on race
and social justice. But Berry says as long as free speech is censored,
volunteer committees are not enough.

As for what she really wants? You’ll have to hear it from her in the
video above.

This time, she won’t be silenced.

Gwen Berry ([@MzBerryThrows](https://twitter.com/mzberrythrows)) is an
American Olympian.
