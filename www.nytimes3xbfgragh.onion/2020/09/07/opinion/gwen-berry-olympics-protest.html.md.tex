In sports arenas
\href{https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/12062572/black-lives-matter-england-players-to-take-a-knee-in-nations-league-games}{around
the world}, taking a knee is
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kneeling-athletes-anthem-opinion-poll-28-07-2020/}{no
longer taboo} --- it's trending. But there's at least one place where
protesting is still not allowed.

The Olympic medal podium.

In the video Op-Ed above, the track and field Olympian Gwen Berry
confronts Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee,
over what she feels is his organization's hypocrisy: Olympians are
celebrated for their courage, drive and tenacity. But if they are
spurred by those same traits to demand racial justice? That's a
punishable offense.

On the podium at the 2019 Pan Am Games, Berry raised her fist. Then she
\href{https://www.cbc.ca/sports/george-floyd-athlete-protest-gwen-berry-1.5593346}{paid
for it}. She was reprimanded by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic
Committee and is now unsponsored. She is among the top hammer throwers
in the world, but hasn't received an athletic grant since protesting.

Berry is a Black woman without a safety net defying a global
organization that brought in
\href{https://www.sportbusiness.com/news/ioc-reports-healthy-profit-in-winter-olympics-year/}{\$165
million in profits} in 2018. Yet athletes like her ---
\href{https://www.fastcompany.com/3062575/olympic-athletes-struggle-financially-while-striving-for-gold}{who
often scrape by} --- are faced with an impossible dilemma: keep their
mouths shut or jeopardize their career to fight for justice.

Berry has fought to get to where she is today. She was raised by her
grandmother in a household of 13 in Ferguson, Mo. After having a son at
age 15, she earned a college scholarship and became a top hammer
thrower. While training to qualify for the Olympics in 2016, she held
down two jobs --- working at Dick's Sporting Goods during the day and
delivering Insomnia Cookies at night --- and helped support 10
extended-family members back home.

Equal Play Meet the insurgent athletes who are dragging women's sports
into the 21st century.

explains how she was pressured to lose weight until her body started
breaking down. }

Last month, Team USA formed a council to make recommendations on race
and social justice. But Berry says as long as free speech is censored,
volunteer committees are not enough.

As for what she really wants? You'll have to hear it from her in the
video above.

This time, she won't be silenced.

an American Olympian.
