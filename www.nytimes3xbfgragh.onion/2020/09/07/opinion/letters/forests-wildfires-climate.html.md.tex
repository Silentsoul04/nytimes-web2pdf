\textbf{To the Editor:}

``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/why-does-california-have-wildfires.html?searchResultPosition=7}{Why
California? A Recipe for Catastrophic Wildfires}'' (news article, Aug.
22) knits together current events with authoritative science to help
remove any question whether climate change is fueling our wildfire
crisis. We must accept this reality and move forward with urgency.

For too long, voices on the far left and the far right have impeded
progress on actively ``pre-storing'' our forests for climate change by
denying the clear reality that our forests are entering a new normal,
and so our actions can no longer be normal either.

It is time for consensus to move forward on needed management to make
existing forests more climate resilient, and quickly replant forests
that have been lost with the right tree species, genetics and planting
techniques to survive and thrive in the future.

to Wake, and to Walk}'' (Science Times, Aug. 18):

As a morning person, I would add this to your observations. Morning
people wake smiling, as they are happier to wake up; similarly, no
problem going to bed early.

Night owls hate to get up and resist going to bed. Morning doves wake
with a smile, night owls with a frown.
