<div class="css-53u6y8">

AMHERST, Mass. — It has been a tough summer for Venezuela. The already
ailing country, in the throes of a [severe
lockdown](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52103747), is also experiencing
a major environmental disaster. In July, a state-owned refinery began to
spill oil into the [Morrocoy National
Park](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53767424), one of the
country’s most biodiverse areas. Venezuela also experienced a new
political crisis. The government essentially voided several opposition
parties by [taking
control](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-supreme-court.html)
of their executive boards.

These catastrophes are two sides of the same coin. Rising
authoritarianism in Venezuela has led to oil mismanagement, which in
turn has led to environmental degradation. And oil mismanagement is now
turning the regime even more autocratic, which in turn is leading to
opposition debasement.

Pundits often debate whether [rising oil fortunes contribute to the rise
of
authoritarianism](https://www.vox.com/2014/4/10/5601062/oil-curse-explained).
Large oil windfalls, the argument goes, allow states to offer
consumption booms to the public in lieu of political rights and to fund
repressive forces. But the Venezuelan case seems to be showing that
declining oil fortunes can be both a cause and a consequence of
hardening authoritarianism.

Venezuela used to be one of the most competitive oil producers in the
world. But its oil industry has been run into the ground over the last
two decades, first under President Hugo Chávez and now under his
successor, Nicolás Maduro. Measured in terms of proven reserves,
Venezuela may have [more oil than Saudi
Arabia](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/data_graphs/330.htm). But in
terms of output, Venezuela’s oil industry has collapsed. The country’s
production of oil is at a [77-year
low](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-exports/venezuelas-oil-exports-sank-in-june-to-77-year-low-data-idUSKBN2427AC).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The lesson is clear. Political accountability, human rights and
environmental sustainability constitute a modern-day trifecta. Lose the
former, and the rest disappears as well.

Mr. Chávez eroded the checks and balances inside and outside the state
oil company and turned it into his own A.T.M. Party loyalists replaced
oil engineers. Investment protocols were discontinued. Safety standards
were ignored. All that mattered was for the oil company to channel
dollars to fund the ruling party’s elections.

Not surprisingly, [production
declined](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341117583_Oil_and_regime_type_in_Latin_America_Reversing_the_line_of_causality)
between 2003 and 2014. Oddly, the decline took place at a time when the
price of oil price was booming. No freely trading oil nation experienced
this strange outcome. While many blame U.S. sanctions under President
Trump, the evidence that the collapse was homemade[and
pre-Trump](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/venezuelan-oil-assessment)
is overwhelming.

Venezuela’s oil collapse has taken a huge environmental toll.
Corruption, underinvestments and weak controls led to the state-owned
oil company’s economic collapse. They are also responsible for an
increase in [company
accidents](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14984) and oil spills.
According to a report, the country experienced [46,820 toxic
spills](https://www.derechos.org.ve/actualidad/en-seis-anos-pdvsa-derramo-856-72285-barriles-de-petroleo-al-medio-ambiente)
from 2010 to 2018, totaling 856,000 barrels of spilled oil. From July to
August of this year, an estimated [26,000
barrels](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishandegnarain/2020/08/28/oil-spill-august-what-the-major-oil-spills-in-venezuela-and-mauritius-mean-for-the-world/#68dd06bd59bd)
of oil may have affected more than [210
miles](http://www.petroleumworld.com/storyt20082001.htm) of shoreline.
The July spill is the second major spill in a year. And a few days ago,
reports surfaced that a huge oil tanker stationed in Venezuelan waters,
the FSO Nabarima, was on the verge of sinking because of a lack of
proper maintenance. If it sinks, the resulting oil spill could be [five
times larger than
the](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/09/02/world/americas/ap-lt-venezuela-sinking-oil-tanker.html#:~:text=CARACAS%2C%20Venezuela%20%E2%80%94%20The%20sight%20of,a%20dangerous%20state%20of%20disrepair.)Exxon
Valdez spill of 1989.

The collapse of oil prices from mid-2014 to early 2016 also deepened
Venezuela’s economic crisis, overwhelming the administration of Mr.
Maduro. Because production was already so low in 2015, Venezuela’s
economy sank more than those of other petrostates. The country’s economy
has continued to contract every year since then, leading to a
humanitarian and [refugee
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/20/world/americas/venezuela-refugees-colombia.html)
comparable to that experienced by [war-torn
Syria](https://www.devex.com/news/venezuela-crisis-is-on-the-scale-of-syria-unhcr-says-93465).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This oil crisis is also producing a hardening of authoritarianism. Under
normal circumstances, an economic crisis such as Venezuela’s would have
produced one of two political outcomes: a change in policy or a change
in government. In Venezuela, it is producing more repression.

For ruling parties, policy changes make sense when the ruling party is
interested in staying electorally competitive. But since the mid-2000s,
Venezuela’s ruling party has given up on fair elections. It is only
interested in staying in office.

So instead of policy corrections, Mr. Maduro has relied on unregulated
gold mining (whose toll on the environment and human security is also
dismal), crackdowns on citizens’ protests and electoral tricks to disarm
the opposition. This culminated in this summer’s nationalization of the
opposition parties.

The Constitution of Venezuela mandates that Mr. Maduro schedule a
legislative election this year. The government knows it cannot win such
an election competing freely, so it has [opted to change the electoral
rules](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/07/07/venezuela-rulings-threaten-free-and-fair-elections).
The government has expanded the number of seats in the National Assembly
from 167 to 277 with the aim of diluting the power of the strongest
opposition parties now in control. It has also refused to make electoral
authorities impartial and replaced the leadership of opposition parties
with people willing to go along with the government. Mr. Maduro has
pardoned more than 100 political prisoners, which is a nice concession,
but has kept the electoral irregularities in place. These irregularities
have [split the opposition into two
camps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuelas-maduro-pardons-more-than-100-political-opponents-ahead-of-elections/2020/08/31/c5770df0-ebbf-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html),
with one sector hoping to compete electorally and another calling for
abstention.

The United States is claiming, rightly, that [the election is
rigged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics/us-accuses-venezuelas-maduro-of-seeking-to-rig-upcoming-vote-idUSKBN23M2OJ).
It may even be encouraging the opposition to abstain rather than unite
electorally. The problem is that abstention is exactly what the
Venezuelan government wants. The United States may be unintentionally
helping the government weaken the once electorally mighty opposition.

The United States has also played a role in the oil spill. While the
spill is the result of industry decay in Venezuela, its continuation is
connected to the U.S. oil embargo. Venezuela is now
[precluded](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuela-crisis-oil-gas-shortage-maduro-guaido/2020/04/15/19fd9864-7daa-11ea-84c2-0792d8591911_story.html)
from using refineries in the United States to process its oil into
gasoline. This is one reason the government has not shut down the
damaged refinery: It is the only one in the country that produces
gasoline. So [the leak has
continued](https://www.cambio16.com/derrame-de-petroleo-en-venezuela-aun-no-ha-cesado/),
with oil now entering rivers and lakes.

It’s easy to blame factors such as poor vision by the opposition and
inconsistent responses by the United States for Venezuela’s turn to
incompetent and mean authoritarianism. Those factors are present, but
they are not the main drivers. Venezuela’s descent into authoritarianism
has the same source as July’s oil spill: Venezuela is a petrostate that
has lost interest in accountability.
