## La Quinta | $425,000

### <span>**A three-bedroom, three-bathroom condominium on a 44-acre complex built in 2007**</span>

This condo is part of Legacy Villas, a 44-acre complex connected to La
Quinta Resort and Club, a popular destination for golfers. The resort’s
golf course and several others are within a five-minute drive.

The facilities at the complex include 12 pools, 11 hot tubs, children’s
splash pads, walking trails and bicycle paths. Many residents are
year-round, while others use their units as vacation homes or rental
properties. A nearby shopping center, about 10 minutes away by car, has
several grocery stores, including a Trader Joe’s, as well as a Target
and a number of casual restaurants.

**Size:** 1,706 square feet

**Price per square foot:** $249

**Indoors:** This is an upper-level unit, with outdoor stairs leading
from the sidewalk to the front door.

The foyer opens into a carpeted living room with a fireplace and
built-in bookshelves. (The furniture is included in the asking price.)
The ceiling is trimmed with dark wood beams that continue into the
dining area, where French doors open to a balcony with mountain views.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The dining area is divided from the kitchen by a breakfast bar with a
granite countertop. The kitchen has cherry-wood cabinets and a window
over the sink that looks out on the mountains.

Off the living room is a hallway connecting the three bedrooms, each
with an en suite bathroom. The first bedroom is large enough to hold a
full-size bed; the second has a fireplace, a soaking tub in the
bathroom, a laundry closet and a wet bar.

At the end of the hall is the main bedroom suite, which has a fireplace,
a private balcony and a bathroom with a separate soaking tub and walk-in
shower.

**Outdoor space:** Both balconies are shaded by roof overhangs, with
Spanish-tile floors and space for a table and chairs. Two of the
complex’s swimming pools are within a three-minute walk. The
clubhouse, which includes a fitness center, is less than half a mile
away, as is an on-site restaurant. This unit comes with two assigned
outdoor parking spaces.

**Taxes:** $5,440 (estimated), plus a $741 monthly homeowner association
fee

## San Rafael | $430,000

### <span>**A unit in a 1963 condominium complex, with one bedroom and one bathroom**</span>

San Rafael, the county seat and largest city in Marin County, is about
40 minutes north of San Francisco, with a population of around 58,000.
Much of the area is open space: There are 19 city parks in San Rafael,
and China Camp State Park, on the shore of San Pablo Bay, is about 15
minutes by car from this property.

The pink-stucco Marin County Civic Center, designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright and completed after his death, is also about 15 minutes away. It
has appeared in a number of movies, and George Lucas credited it as the
inspiration for structures in the “Star Wars” ** films.

**Size:** 804 square feet

**Price per square foot:** $535

**Indoors:** This unit is at the end of a row of four, with only one
wall in common with its neighbor.

To the immediate right of the front door is a galley-style kitchen, to
which the owner added an induction stove. The far end of the kitchen is
open to a dining space connected to the main living area.

The living room, like the rest of the apartment, has hardwood floors
installed by the owner. The windows, which face Marin County’s hilly
landscape, have custom blinds and a built-in bench-style seat. There is
also a built-in desk that creates a home office nook and sliding-glass
doors that open to a balcony.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Off one side of the living room are a bedroom with access to the balcony
and a bathroom with a combination tub and shower.

**Outdoor space:** Connected to the living room and bedroom is a private
outdoor space with room for a cafe table and chairs. The complex is near
several hiking trails and has swimming pools, a tennis court and a
clubhouse that residents can use for social events. The attached garage
holds one car.

**Taxes:** $6,536 (estimated), plus a $461 monthly homeowner association
fee

## Grass Valley | $425,000

### <span>**A remodeled ranch house built in 1956, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, on a 0.6-acre lot**</span>

Grass Valley, a city of about 13,000, is in the foothills of the Sierra
Nevada mountains. During the California Gold Rush, the Empire Mine and
the North Star Mine — both 10 minutes away from the city’s quaint
downtown — were among the state’s top-producing mines. Today, they are
open to the public.

Lake Tahoe is about 90 minutes east by car; Sacramento is about an hour
and 10 minutes southwest. This house is a five-minute drive from Grass
Valley’s amenities, including restaurants, several B\&Bs and an Art
Moderne movie theater.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

**Size:** 1,102 square feet

**Price per square foot:** $386

**Indoors:** This house sits on more than a half acre, set back from the
street, with several mature trees in the front yard.

The door, bright red with a decorative inset window, opens to the living
room. Like the rest of the house, the room was made over during an early
2020 remodel. At the center is a painted brick fireplace, and large
windows face the front and side yards.

The living room flows into the dining area, which has an exposed-brick
wall painted white. Hardwood floors continue into the kitchen, where the
stainless steel appliances sit under quartz countertops and a white-tile
backsplash. A sliding-glass door leads from the kitchen to the deck.

A hallway connects the kitchen to a linen closet and a bathroom with
walk-in shower that has a frosted-glass door.

To the right of the front door is a bedroom with new carpeting and a
closet concealed behind a barn-style door. Next door is a second
bedroom, roughly equal in size, with a backyard-facing window. At the
end of the corridor connecting the bedrooms is a bathroom with a
black-and-white-patterned linoleum floor. The vanity, also new, has a
marble top.

**Outdoor space:** Off the kitchen is a wood deck with space for outdoor
dining. Steps lead to a guest cottage with a full bathroom. A second
deck, with more room for lounging, connects the cottage to a garden
shed. The detached garage has space for two cars.

**Taxes:** $5,015 (estimated)
