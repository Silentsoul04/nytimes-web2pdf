LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Plenty of players have had bumpy experiences at
the N.B.A.’s restart at Walt Disney World. Rajon Rondo and Markieff
Morris, two key reserves for the Los Angeles Lakers, would count
themselves among that group.

Rondo, the team’s backup point guard, broke his right thumb during a
practice on July 12 and left the league’s so-called bubble so that he
could have surgery and recover. Morris, a forward who signed with the
Lakers in February, shortly before the [season was
suspended](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/11/sports/basketball/nba-season-suspended-coronavirus.html)
because of the coronavirus pandemic, has been laboring to unearth his
rhythm.

The Lakers have championship hopes in the form of LeBron James and
Anthony Davis, their twin stars. But if they want to advance in the
postseason, their supporting cast needs to start producing with
consistency. Depth is an issue — one underscored by the absence of Avery
Bradley, their top perimeter defender, who [opted not to
participate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/sports/coronavirus-players-nba-mlb-opt-out.html)
in the restart.

For one game, at least, James and Davis got the help they needed. In the
Lakers’ 117-109 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night in the
Western Conference semifinals, Morris, 31, stretched the floor with his
outside shooting while Rondo, 34, was a whirl of activity. The win
evened the best-of-seven series at one game apiece ahead of Game 3 on
Tuesday night.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“That’s what the playoffs are about,” the Lakers’ Danny Green said.
“Your superstars are going to play well. It’s what your others do.”

The others he referenced, the team’s supporting cast, have always been a
concern with these Lakers, who have endured [no small amount of
turmoil](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/sports/basketball/lakers-clippers-nba-playoffs.html)
this season. In that sense, their loss to the Rockets in Game 1 on
Friday was true to form. The Rockets used their small lineup to space
the floor and create oodles of open shots.

Rondo, who had four turnovers in that game, struggled, though perhaps
for good reason: He had not played in a game since March 10.

“So you have to forgive a little bit of rust,” Lakers Coach Frank Vogel
said. “His impact on our team is measured in swag and just the
confidence that he brings to our group.”

On Sunday, Rondo had 10 points, 9 assists and 5 steals in 29 minutes.
When he was on the court, the Lakers outscored the Rockets by 28 points.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Rondo, who did not address the news media after the game, also appeared
to form some immediate chemistry with Morris, who came off the bench in
the first quarter to hit four 3-pointers in a span of 2 minutes 46
seconds. Rondo assisted on all four of them.

“Rondo’s not hard to play with,” said Morris, who added: “It’s about
time I started making some shots.”

Entering the game, Morris had shot 3-of-13 from 3-point range in the
playoffs. On Sunday, he shot 6-of-8 from the field and finished with 16
points.

“Last game, I felt like I didn’t affect the game at all,” he said. “And
it’s not even just making shots. I just felt like I didn’t do anything.
I didn’t bring no energy. I didn’t bring no toughness. I didn’t rebound
the ball. I had zero stats across the board, so I felt like I have to be
a little more aggressive. This is the best series for me to play a lot
of minutes.”

That had everything to do with matchups and [the unique style of
play](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/sports/the-rockets-small-ball-strategy-gets-a-big-test-against-the-lakers.html)
that the Rockets, with their center-less rotation, brought to the
bubble.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

After Game 1, James spoke highly of the Rockets’ speed. He compared them
to the N.F.L.’s St. Louis Rams, circa the early 2000s, a team that
seemed to run on rocket fuel.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The greatest show on turf,” James said. “People always said how you
could scout ’em, scout ’em, scout ’em — until you got on the field.”

There was no way opposing defenses could simulate the Rams’ speed, said
James, who suggested that the Rockets are much the same. His hope was
that the Lakers would make the necessary adjustments after getting
punished in transition in Game 1.

They made enough. Vogel went smaller in Game 2, effectively benching his
centers. JaVale McGee played just eight minutes before he left because
of an ankle injury. (Vogel said after the game that McGee was undergoing
an M.R.I.) And while Vogel said he had intended to play Dwight Howard,
his backup center, Morris was too good and Vogel decided to stick with
him. Howard remained on the bench for the duration.

At the same time, the Lakers played swarming defense on James Harden,
who had to work for his 27 points, and Russell Westbrook, who shot
4-of-15 from the field for 10 points while committing seven turnovers.
Even by Westbrook-ian standards, he was chaotic.

“It’s on me,” Westbrook said. “I don’t point fingers at anybody else. I
own my mistakes. I own what I do, and that’s that.”

The Lakers did not exactly assemble a complete game. After leading by as
many as 21 points in the second quarter, they found themselves trailing
by 5 points in the third quarter after the Rockets caught fire from the
outside.

But James opened the fourth quarter with a driving dunk, part of another
postseason tour de force for him: 28 points, 11 rebounds and 9 assists.
Davis was terrific, too, finishing with 34 points and 10 rebounds.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But two reserves helped put them in position to seal the win — two
experienced players, Davis said, “who aren’t afraid of anything.” They
showed up just in time.
