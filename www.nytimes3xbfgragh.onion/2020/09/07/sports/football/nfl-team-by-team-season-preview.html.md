While just about every other American sports league had to radically
change its season because of the coronavirus, the N.F.L. waited
patiently, insisting it would [stick with its normal
timeline](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/sports/football/nfl-schedule.html).
That confidence appears to have paid off, with the league set to kick
off on Thursday, just as it said it would all along.

The league should look and feel quite different, as most Week 1 games
are expected to be played minus fans in the stands — the Dallas Cowboys
insist they will have a crowd — and plenty of important [players have
opted
out](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/08/sports/football/nfl-players-opt-out.html).

But, focusing solely on the game, the N.F.L. is in great shape. A new
generation of quarterbacks, led by Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City
Chiefs and Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens, has made the league
even more exciting, and unexpected turnarounds by certain teams in
recent seasons have made it seem that any franchise is a move or two
away from relevance.

To get everyone caught up, we broke the league down, team by team,
looking at what’s changed and what you might expect during what should
be an exciting, unusual season.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Buffalo Bills**</span>

**Key move:** Trading for wide receiver Stefon Diggs.

**Outlook:** The Bills (10-6) made the playoffs in two of the past three
seasons; two of the teams in their division are in talent-acquisition
mode; and the other one just said goodbye to a [six-time Super
Bowl-winning
quarterback](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/sports/football/tom-brady-patriots.html).
It might be time to get excited in Buffalo (something Bills fans are
known for, even if [Pinto
Ron](https://www.buffalobills.com/news/11-questions-with-bills-superfan-pinto-ron)
will have to be sprayed with condiments at home this year).

The known quantity is the team’s defense, where cornerback Tre’Davious
White leads one of the best units in the N.F.L. and Ed Oliver, a
second-year defensive tackle, is poised for a breakout.

The question is what to make of the offense. Quarterback Josh Allen
mostly needs to hold steady and let the defense cook, but he’s young,
has a big arm, and a lot of confidence. With Diggs and his fellow wide
receivers John Brown and Cole Beasley running routes, the temptation to
let the ball fly will be high.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Jets**</span>

**Key move:** Drafting [Mekhi
Becton.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/sports/football/jets-mekhi-becton-draft.html)

**Outlook:** The Jets (7-9) began last season 1-7, but went 6-2 the rest
of the way. That improvement was largely a reflection of their
opponents, but it was also better than losing. That they landed a
terrific left tackle prospect, Louisville’s Becton, at No. 11 in the
draft was a cherry on top, because he can spend a decade protecting the
team’s most prized asset: quarterback [Sam
Darnold](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/24/sports/football/sam-darnold-jets.html).

On offense, things should look up. Darnold is the real deal, running
back Le’Veon Bell can’t be as bad as he was last season — right? — and
wide receiver Breshad Perriman was a good pickup.

The team’s sneaky-good defense is one of the masterworks of Gregg
Williams’s career as a coordinator, but Williams has a challenge ahead
of him since safety Jamal Adams was traded to Seattle and linebacker
C.J. Moseley opted out of the season. Williams does not lack for
confidence, but Adams and Moseley papered over deficiencies, so their
absence will be
felt.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**New England Patriots**</span>

**Key move:** Signing quarterback [Cam
Newton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/sports/football/cam-newton-new-england-patriots.html)?

**Outlook:** Throughout the [Bill
Belichick](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/sports/football/cam-newton-patriots-deal.html)
era, the Patriots (12-4) have jettisoned good players left and right
without losing a step. But the constant over those two decades was
quarterback [Tom
Brady](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/sports/football/tom-brady-tampa-bay-buccaneers.html).

By itself, [Brady’s
departure](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/sports/football/tom-brady-boston-patriot-fans.html)
isn’t reason to be particularly skeptical about New England, because he
was fairly bad last season. But factor in the defense’s loss of Kyle Van
Noy, Jamie Collins, Elandon Roberts and Dont’a Hightower through free
agency and opt-outs, and the team seems gutted.

There is potential for Newton to thrive in an offense designed by Josh
McDaniels to suit a player of his skills. But that will require Newton
be healthy — something that hasn’t happened in a while — and anyone from
a lackluster group of wide receivers to step up.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It would be unwise to assume Belichick can’t make this work, especially
when he has the best secondary in the N.F.L., but it would be a notable
recovery even for someone with his track record.

### <span>**Miami Dolphins**</span>

**Key move:** Adding good players instead of subtracting them.

**Outlook:** After a series of fire-sale moves last season, there was
talk of the [Dolphins’
finishing 0-16](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/29/sports/football/miami-dolphins-bad-worst.html).
But a funny thing happened on the way to the No. 1 draft pick: Coach
[Brian Flores
coaxed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/19/sports/football/brian-flores-dolphins.html)
some surprising wins out of his team, including a season-ending shocker
over New England, and [Miami (5-11) dropped to the No. 5
pick](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/sports/football/nfl-draft-first-round-patriots.html).

Expecting much out of the team this year would be somewhat unreasonable,
as the Dolphins have largely started from scratch. But with upgrades on
both sides of the ball — particularly in the secondary — a pair of
strong wide receivers in DeVante Parker and Preston Williams, and the
potential for a strong running game if Jordan Howard or Matt Breida can
stay healthy, the idea that Flores can make the team competitive is not
outlandish.

All eyes, however, will be on the rookie quarterback [Tua
Tagovailoa](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/tua-tagovailoa.html),
who is currently the team’s backup, but just one four-interception game
by [Ryan
Fitzpatrick](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/sports/football/nfl-quarterback-controversies.html)
away from
starting.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Baltimore Ravens**</span>

**Key move:** Trading for defensive end Calais Campbell.

**Outlook:** [Lamar
Jackson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/10/sports/football/lamar-jackson-ravens.html)
of the Ravens (14-2) broke the N.F.L.’s single-season rushing record for
a quarterback and threw [36 touchdown
passes](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackLa00.htm).
You don’t need much more analysis of Baltimore’s success last season
than that. But even after a second consecutive [playoff
letdown](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/12/sports/football/lamar-jackson-ravens-playoffs.html),
there is no reason to believe the Ravens’ ground-heavy offense can’t
succeed in the playoffs.

Some regression to the mean should be expected from Jackson. He runs at
a rate that is highly unusual for a quarterback, and teams have probably
picked apart film of his passing. But the Ravens have plenty of solid
running backs to complement him, and they drafted another in Ohio
State’s J.K. Dobbins. The only real concern is the retirement of right
guard Marshal Yanda.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Baltimore’s defense could actually be better. The veterans Derek Wolfe
and Campbell were added to the team’s front seven, and while [safety
Earl
Thomas](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29723620/sources-ravens-cut-trade-earl-thomas-dispute)
was released late in training camp, the team is strong enough to sustain
that loss.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Pittsburgh Steelers**</span>

**Key move:** Signing tight end Eric Ebron.

**Outlook:** The 2019 Steelers (8-8) had a .500 record even though
quarterback [Ben
Roethlisberger](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/16/sports/football/ben-roethlisberger-drew-brees-injury.html)
appeared in just six quarters of football all season. That such a
monumental achievement was viewed by many as disappointing is a
testament to the standards for the team under Coach Mike Tomlin.

Roethlisberger is back after surgery to repair his right elbow, which
should be great news for running back James Conner and wide receiver
JuJu Smith-Schuster. The team also added a major red zone weapon in
Ebron.

The team doesn’t really need Roethlisberger to have another 5,000-yard
passing season, since its defense should comfortably be one of the five
best in the N.F.L. From T.J. Watt on the defensive line to [Minkah
Fitzpatrick in the
secondary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/sports/football/minkah-fitzpatrick-trade-steelers.html),
and everyone in between, this is a loaded unit that could look even
better if the offense stays on the field longer than it did last
season.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Cleveland Browns**</span>

**Key move:** Hiring Kevin Stefanski as head coach.

**Outlook:** It can’t be as bad as last season. The Browns simply have
too much talent to go 6-10 again. Maybe.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The [expectation under Coach Freddie
Kitchens](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/10/sports/football/baker-mayfield-odell-beckham-browns.html)
last season was that quarterback [Baker
Mayfield](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MayfBa00.htm)
would take the leap to superstardom. Instead Mayfield seemed to get much
worse than he was as a rookie in 2018, leaving running back [Nick
Chubb](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/ChubNi00.htm) to
be the team’s breakout star. While Chubb was nothing short of
phenomenal, and may be capable of even more, an offense designed
by[Stefanski](https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/team/coaches-roster/kevin-stefanski)
should lead to more opportunities for Mayfield to get the ball to wide
receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry and tight ends Austin
Hooper and David Njoku.

The team’s defense has building blocks like defensive end Myles Garrett
and cornerback Denzel Ward, and the potential to be well above average.

Everything looks great on paper. Of course, everything looked great on
paper last season.

### <span>**Cincinnati Bengals**</span>

**Key move:** [Drafting quarterback Joe
Burrow](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/joe-burrow-nfl-draft.html).

**Outlook:** Running back Joe Mixon is a terrific player, but if Coach
Zac Taylor is going to open up the Bengals (2-14) offense, it will have
to happen through a passing game led by the No. 1 overall draft pick.
Burrow has all the tools he’ll need in the veteran wide receiver A.J.
Green and the rookie Tee Higgins, and if the ball starts flying
downfield, the thought of Mixon being able to run without a stacked box
in front of him will be fairly terrifying to opponents.

Patience is still key. The team’s talent deficiencies were a big reason
for its N.F.L.-worst record last season, and even after a free agent
spending spree, plus a well-regarded draft, this team should be viewed
very much as a work in
progress.

**Key move:** Signing defensive end Jadeveon Clowney.

**Outlook:** There were two distinct chapters last season for the Titans
(9-7): before Ryan Tannehill and after. While many attributed the
veteran quarterback’s success to the dominance of running back Derrick
Henry, [their relationship was far more symbiotic than it got credit
for](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/09/sports/football/titans-ravens-henry-tannehill.html).
Tannehill’s efficiency and ability to aggressively throw downfield
unlocked Henry’s enormous potential.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The key players are back on offense, with Tannehill receiving far more
money in the hope that he will provide something close to the same
results, and Henry trying not to fall prey to the curse of rushing
leaders, who often decline the next season.

Tennessee’s defense, however, will look a lot different. Defensive
tackle Jurrell Casey, cornerback Logan Ryan and linebacker Wesley
Woodyard are all gone. The unit, with some development from second-year
tackle Jeffrey Simmons, may not collapse entirely, especially after
signing Clowney to a one-year deal. But the Titans took quite a risk in
shaking up their defense so much to help pay for their offense.

### <span>**Houston Texans**</span>

**Key move:** Trading for running back David Johnson\*.

**Outlook:** The key move for the Texans (10-6) gets an asterisk
because, while Johnson is a very talented young running back who should
be a versatile option for quarterback Deshaun Watson, the Texans gave up
wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in the trade. Hopkins is in the
conversation about the best wide receiver in the game, and his steady
presence gave the team the luxury of not relying on other receivers like
Will Fuller and Kenny Stills to have consistent success.

Watson is so good it seems that he can make anything work, and he and
Johnson could be a devastating combination. But it’s hard to get
enthusiastic about a team that has a suspect defense and that traded
away a franchise icon. Especially so when it faces a brutal start to the
season, with the first six weeks including games against Kansas City,
Baltimore, Pittsburgh and
Tennessee.

### <span>**Indianapolis Colts**</span>

**Key move:** Traded for defensive lineman DeForest Buckner.

**Outlook:** How much does quarterback Philip Rivers, 38, have left in
the tank? The Colts (7-9) are about to find out. The veteran passer was
all over the place last season for the Chargers, but the Colts appear
determined to have their offense controlled by running backs Marlon Mack
and Jonathan Taylor (or, more realistically, by left guard Quenton
Nelson). That creates a dream scenario for Rivers in which all the team
truly wants from him is leadership, the occasional deep floater to T.Y.
Hilton or Parris Campbell, and some creative plays underneath to the
third-down back, Nyheim Hines. Rivers seemingly could manage that into
his 50s.

Adding Buckner, fresh off a Super Bowl appearance with the 49ers, gives
the superstar linebacker Darius Leonard much-needed help and could be a
boon to linebacker Justin Houston, as Buckner tends to punch awfully big
holes in offensive lines.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Jacksonville Jaguars**</span>

**Key move:** Cleaning up their salary cap sheet for 2021 or 2022.

**Outlook:** Gardner Minshew is a lovable scamp who is probably a better
quarterback than Nick Foles at this point in their careers. Does that
make the Jaguars (6-10) good?
[Nope.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/sports/football/jacksonville-jaguars-salary-cap-fournette.html)
The subtraction of running back Leonard Fournette doesn’t make the team
any worse — which is a fairly strong indictment of Fournette — and wide
receiver D.J. Chark has promise, so the Jaguars will score some points
and win some games. Not many, though.

Sadder is the dismantling of the team’s defense. The Jaguars’ remarkable
2017 season may have been something of a fluke, but it’s hard to say
because just about every significant player from that defense has been
sent elsewhere, often under rushed and dramatic circumstances. The most
recent departures were Yannick Ngakoue and Calais Campbell, but the team
has also lost Marcell Dareus, Jalen Ramsey and Dante Fowler in recent
years, and no team could endure that type of
exodus.

### <span>**Kansas City Chiefs**</span>

**Key move:** Giving [Mahomes half a billion
dollars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/sports/football/pat-mahomes-contract.html).

**Outlook:** Mahomes has already won the N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player

### The Coronavirus Outbreak

#### Sports and the Virus

Updated Sept. 9, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - September Saturdays at Penn State are usually the apex of a week
        of hype. Now, as at other college football destinations, the
        approach of autumn has been [unusually
        quiet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/sports/penn-state-college-football-canceled.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) there.
      - More than half the players who made the quarterfinals at the
        U.S. Open were not supposed to be there. It’s a [little bit
        easier](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/sports/us-open-crowd.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) when
        there are no fans, some say.
      - In a pandemic, [getting to a
        triathlon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/sports/ironman-tallinn-triathlon-pandemic.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) is
        as hard as finishing it. The first Ironman race since March, in
        Tallinn, Estonia, included travel restrictions, temperature
        checks, masked volunteers and medals handed over in bags.

The team’s defense has taken its lumps, but it showed up when it counted
most in the Super Bowl, and with Chris Jones back to anchor the
defensive line, and safety Tyrann Mathieu roaming in the secondary,
there should be little fear of a drop-off.

### <span>**Las Vegas Raiders**</span>

**Key move:** Drafting wide receiver Henry Ruggs III.

**Outlook:** It has been a rough re-entry to the N.F.L. for [Coach Jon
Gruden](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/05/sports/football/antonio-brown-raiders.html),
but he and General Manager Mike Mayock appear to be building a team that
shouldn’t be a pushover in [its first season in the
desert](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/13/sports/football/oakland-raiders-las-vegas-stadium.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Having bolstered one of the best offensive lines in football for several
seasons, the Raiders (7-9) now have the skill players to make use of all
that time that line provides. Running back Josh Jacobs is wildly
explosive, and quarterback Derek Carr has some terrific targets in tight
ends Darren Waller and Jason Witten, and wide receivers Henry Ruggs III
and Zay Jones.

The Raiders’ defense may not have a lot of household names, but it has
strong players at each level, with the potential for a breakout year
from defensive end Maxx
Crosby.

### <span>**Los Angeles Chargers**</span>

**Key move:** Keeping quarterback Tyrod Taylor around to give [Justin
Herbert](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/justin-herbert.html)
time.

**Outlook:** There’s not much that’s recognizable for fans of a team
that said goodbye to a potential Hall of Famer quarterback (Philip
Rivers) and a former Pro Bowl running back (Melvin Gordon), while losing
one of its best defensive players, safety Derwin James, to a severe knee
injury. But then, there aren’t many people who would ID themselves as
followers at this point. [For the few who
do](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/19/sports/football/if-the-chargers-score-and-no-ones-there-to-cheer-does-the-owner-care.html),
here are inklings of optimism for the Chargers (5-11).

Los Angeles used the [No. 6 draft pick on quarterback Justin
Herbert](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/sports/football/nfl-draft-live.html#link-1f4f47de),
and while he’s probably not ready yet, the team bought itself plenty of
time by retaining Taylor, who should have had a starting job in the
first place. Along with the versatile running back Austin Ekeler and
wide receiver Mike Williams, the offense has the potential to be far
better than last year’s.

The Chargers had a top-10 defense in each of the last two seasons, and
even without James they could very well make it three straight years.

### <span>**Denver Broncos**</span>

**Key move:** Trading for defensive tackle Jurrell Casey.

**Outlook:** The Broncos (7-9) appear to have settled on Drew Lock at
quarterback, and they have worked to build around him with a new
offensive coordinator, Pat Shurmur, and a fairly robust group of skill
players — running backs Phillip Lindsay and Melvin Gordon, wide
receivers Courtland Sutton, Tim Patrick and Jerry Jeudy, and tight end
Noah Fant. If the team can patch together a decent offensive line, there
will be little excuse for Lock not to succeed, and that might take some
pressure off John Elway, the team’s president, who has made some
questionable quarterback decisions in recent years.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The team’s defense is not what it was a few years ago and [Von Miller
may be
sidelined](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1303712772140789762) for
the start of the season. But stealing Casey from the Titans should pay
large dividends and the acquisition of cornerback A.J. Bouye helps blunt
the loss of Chris Harris
Jr.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Dallas Cowboys**</span>

**Key move:** [Hiring Coach Mike
McCarthy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/06/sports/football/mike-mccarthy-jerry-jones-cowboys.html).

**Outlook*:*** If it felt as though the Cowboys (8-8) consistently
underperformed under Jason Garrett, it was because they did. No team
with quarterback [Dak
Prescott](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/11/sports/football/cowboys-dak-prescott-can-handle-any-kind-of-pressure.html),
running back Ezekiel Elliott and wide receivers Amari Cooper and Michael
Gallup, all protected by a top-notch offensive line, should ever finish
8-8. But that’s exactly what they did, giving away what should have been
the easiest division title in N.F.C. East history.

In steps McCarthy, who may have worn out his welcome in Green Bay, but
is a safe bet to get a lot more out of this talented offense. He
retained Kellen Moore, last year’s supposed wunderkind of an offensive
coordinator, and brought in Mike Nolan to revamp a defense that has
enough talent to get by.

Cooper has said he believes the offense, with the addition of the rookie
wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, could become the rare unit with three
1,000-yard receivers. Focusing on winning nine games might be a better
plan.

### <span>**Philadelphia Eagles**</span>

**Key move:** Trading for cornerback Darius Slay.

**Outlook:** The Eagles (9-7) have had a wild ride the last few seasons,
[winning a Super
Bowl](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/04/sports/eagles-super-bowl-champions.html)
with a backup quarterback, falling apart entirely the next season, and
then turning into a team that somehow felt like a plucky upstart last
season despite having a franchise quarterback and a top-10 defense. Even
with that statistical roller coaster, the team has found itself in the
playoffs three years in a row, which is quite a feat.

On offense, the key is health. Keeping quarterback Carson Wentz on his
feet may be a bit easier with the veteran tackle Jason Peters moving to
guard to make way for Andre Dillard. And Miles Sanders seems like a
solution to the team’s revolving door at running back.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On defense, Philadelphia dropped a ton of money on defensive tackle
Javon Hargrave, who will team with Fletcher Cox and Malik Jackson on a
ridiculously deep defensive line. With that group forcing quarterbacks
into countless unwise throws, the newly acquired Slay may find himself
looking like a defensive player of the year
candidate.

### <span>**Washington Football Team**</span>

**Key move:** Retiring an [offensive nickname and
logo](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/sports/football/native-american-washington-name-change.html).

**Outlook:** Sorting out the off-season drama for Washington (3-13)
would take far more space than is available here, but rest assured:
[It’s been
messy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/sports/football/dan-snyder-washington-football-ownership.html).

Talking about strictly about on-the-field matters, however, the team
should have an upward trajectory, with the caveat that it’s easy to move
up when you’re at the absolute bottom. Coach [Ron
Rivera](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/sports/football/washington-football-ron-rivera-cancer.html)
has proved he can succeed in the N.F.L., but for now his emphasis needs
to be on building a new culture.

The quarterback position should be fairly interesting, as second-year
starter Dwayne Haskins has some ability and also some troubles staying
healthy. The improbable return of Alex Smith from [a horrific leg
injury](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29671320/washington-qb-alex-smith-cleared-football-activity-team)
is worthy of Hollywood consideration, but the chances that he unseats
Haskins, absent an injury to the younger player, are remote. At least
there are people to choose from. At running back, the release of both
Derrius Guice and Adrian Peterson has left the cupboard almost entirely
bare.

The defense, now led by Jack Del Rio, will get a big boost from the
rookie defensive end Chase Young. But this team is several good players
away from relevance.

### <span>**Giants**</span>

**Key move:** Presumably remembering what they have in [Saquon
Barkley](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/18/sports/football/saquon-barkley-return-giants.html).

**Outlook:** Everyone got very excited when quarterback [Daniel Jones
won his first two
starts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/29/sports/football/daniel-jones-giants-draft-haskins.html)
last year (4-12). He then looked a lot like an [overwhelmed
rookie](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/07/sports/football/daniel-jones-eli-manning-giants-quarterback.html)
out of Duke, going 1-9 the rest of the way.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

To fix an offense that seemed to make very little use its ultra-talented
running back, or of the promising tight end Evan Engram, the Giants
tapped New England’s wide receivers coach, [Joe Judge, as head
coach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/07/sports/football/joe-judge-giants.html)
and brought in Jason Garrett as offensive coordinator. Both managed to
engender quite a bit of enthusiasm despite having come from jobs where
the units they managed dramatically underwhelmed.

The offense could show some serious improvement, but the team’s defense
is so bad that it won’t
matter.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Green Bay Packers**</span>

**Key move:** Drafting quarterback [Jordan
Love](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/jordan-love.html).
([Don’t tell Aaron
Rodgers.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/sports/football/nfl-quarterback-controversies.html))

**Outlook:** You can’t exactly fake a 13-3 record, but the Packers
certainly never felt like a top contender last season. Coach Matt
LaFleur was supposedly brought in to [unlock the remaining potential in
Rodgers’s golden
arm](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/21/sports/football/aaron-rodgers-packers-coach.html),
but instead LaFleur seemed to fall in love with running the ball,
leaving Rodgers with statistics fairly similar to those from the 2018
season, which got Coach Mike McCarthy fired.

In all, Green Bay was a fairly middling team in all facets of the game,
but finished tied for the second best record in the N.F.L. thanks to a
soft schedule and some luck.

With Rodgers healthy, somewhere between 10 and 13 wins feels like a
given, but if the Packers want to avoid having things fall apart
entirely whenever he departs (think Troy Aikman or Steve Young) they
need to start thinking about what comes after. Drafting a potential star
in Love was the right call, even if it worsened an already bad
relationship between Rodgers and the team. Maybe Rodgers, who tends to
thrive while playing with a chip on his shoulder, can really stick it to
his bosses by throwing 35 touchdown passes this season.

### <span>**Minnesota Vikings**</span>

**Key move:** The team kept a few of its good players.

**Outlook:** Wide receiver Stefon Diggs is gone. So are Linval Joseph,
Everson Griffen, Xavier Rhodes and Trae Waynes, all defensive stalwarts
for the Vikings (10-6). Michael Pierce, who was brought in to replace
Joseph, opted out of this season. Plenty of teams go through periods of
turnover, but a playoff team jettisoning a solid portion of the players
anyone has heard of is a little extreme.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Coach Mike Zimmer probably deserves some leeway with all of the
defensive movement, since he has consistently put a strong product on
the field. And embracing a youth movement is probably better than
standing pat just for continuity’s sake.

On offense, however, it’s hard to justify the team letting things go so
wrong with Diggs, who was responsible for [one of the most memorable
moments in franchise
history](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/15/sports/vikings-saints-stefon-diggs-marcus-williams.html).
A team and player souring on each other happens, but breaking up the
pairing of Diggs and Adam Thielen makes Minnesota’s offense
worse.

### <span>**Detroit Lions**</span>

**Key move:** Signing linebacker Jamie Collins.

**Outlook:** Things have not been pretty over the last two seasons for
Coach Matt Patricia, but at least in Collins he has someone with whom he
can chat about happier days in New England.

Should quarterback Matthew Stafford get back to his typically stellar
health, he will throw for a lot of yards. They sometimes feel like empty
calories, but there will be [a lot of
them](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/04/sports/drew-brees-passing-yards.html).
If history is any indication, the Lions (3-12-1) will have a hard time
deciding on a primary running back between Kerryon Johnson and the
rookie D’Andre Swift, but if they can ever find some balance for their
offense it might help things considerably.

On defense, the guys you’ve heard of (Darius Slay, Snacks Harrison,
etc.) are gone, replaced by Collins and a few other acquisitions who
might be a better fit for Patricia’s scheme.

It wouldn’t be ridiculous to suggest the team could improve, but the
Lions are a hard team to believe in.

### <span>**Chicago Bears**</span>

**Key move:** Trading for quarterback [Nick
Foles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/sports/football/nfl-quarterback-controversies.html).

**Outlook:** Hoping that the veteran backup quarterback who once stepped
in for an injured No. 2 draft pick and won a Super Bowl could do the
same thing for your team had big “buying a lottery ticket at the same
store that sold a recent jackpot” energy. But Nick Foles, as flawed as
he can be, seemed like an upgrade over Mitchell Trubisky, and the Bears
(8-8), led by their terrific defense, didn’t need greatness from their
quarterback. They needed competence.

Somehow, some way, Trubisky appears to have beaten out Foles for the
starting job. So the Bears will now pay more than $20 million for a
backup, while keeping the same bad quarterback.

That defense, though, is still special. It was not nearly as
opportunistic last season as it had been in recent years, but with stars
like Khalil Mack, Akiem Hicks and Eddie Jackson, the potential for
explosiveness is there if the offense finds a way to manage its end of
the
bargain.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**New Orleans Saints**</span>

**Key move:** Not having Drew Brees retire.

**Outlook:** Few teams can match the Saints’ (13-3) run over the last
few regular seasons, and none can match their postseason heartbreak. At
least last season’s wild-card round defeat against Minnesota was just a
plain old overtime upset and didn’t come with the enhanced drama of
their losses to the [Vikings in the 2017 season’s
playoffs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/01/14/sports/vikings-stefon-diggs-saints.html)
and to the [Rams in the following year’s
playoffs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/20/sports/saints-rams-call-officials.html).

The chance to get another season out of Brees at quarterback, though, is
quite a gift. While [Teddy Bridgewater did well as an injury
fill-in](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/21/sports/football/backup-quarterback-teddy-bridgewater-mahomes.html),
he’s gone now, and the team will have a year to figure out if Jameis
Winston or Taysom Hill is their future. That the team has complemented
wide receiver Michael Thomas with the veteran Emmanuel Sanders should
make life easy for whoever is under center.

As for the team’s defense, there has been steady improvement over the
last few years, and a top-10 showing this season is not out of the realm
of possibility.

</div>

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**</span>

**Key move:** There were several.

**Outlook:** To complement the N.F.L.’s best run defense, the Buccaneers
(7-9) added a six-time [Super Bowl-winning
quarterback](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/sports/football/tom-brady-tampa-bay-buccaneers.html),
a four-time All-Pro tight end and a 25-year-old running back who has
rushed for more than 1,000 yards in two of his first three seasons.
Should we see red flags in the fact that the quarterback (Tom Brady) is
43, the tight end ([Rob
Gronkowski](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/sports/football/rob-gronkowski-tom-brady-buccaneers-patriots.html))
was retired last season and the running back (Leonard Fournette) was
released by the awful Jaguars? Well, that’s no fun\!

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Brady, to be clear, wasn’t very good last year. He was just a season
removed from winning a Super Bowl and had previously seemed absolutely
ageless, but the wheels came off and he looked his age. Will he throw 30
interceptions, as Jameis Winston did last season? No. Will he throw for
33 touchdowns, as Winston did? Probably not.

Brady has two of the best wide receivers in the game, and the parallel
to Joe Montana — who got a new home in Kansas City at the end of his
career — is there. And hey, everything is more [fun when Gronk is
around](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/sports/football/rob-gronkowski-tom-brady.html).
But the range of possibilities for how this could turn out is
wide.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Atlanta Falcons**</span>

**Key move:** Signing running back Todd Gurley.

**Outlook:** Quarterback Matt Ryan is a model of consistency, churning
out 4,000 passing yards and 25-plus touchdowns just about every season
regardless of who is around him. He goes into this season with
potentially the most talented group of skill players he has ever had, as
wide receivers Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley should have plenty of help
from tight end Hayden Hurst and running back Todd Gurley. Gurley’s
health is obviously the biggest wild card for the Falcons (7-9), but if
he can suit up for 12 or more games, Atlanta could be very dangerous on
that side of the ball.

The team’s defense is not without talent, but it doesn’t have much of an
identity, either. Considering the team’s offensive ability, turning the
defense into the league’s 16th or 17th best unit would be enough for
success.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Carolina Panthers**</span>

**Key move:** Signing quarterback Teddy Bridgewater.

**Outlook:** [Firing Coach Ron
Rivera](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/04/sports/football/why-was-ron-rivera-fired.html)
felt premature, and [giving up on quarterback Cam
Newton](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/sports/football/cam-newton-panthers-injury-release.html)
was rough. But the Panthers (5-11) just might show some serious
improvement with Bridgewater guiding an offense that has a do-everything
star in Christian McCaffrey and a pair of legitimate wide receivers in
D.J. Moore and Robby Anderson. There is bust potential as well, with a
lack of depth making any injury devastating, but a repeat of last
season’s struggles seems unlikely.

The Carolina defense, on the other hand, was dealt a crushing blow with
the [early retirement of linebacker Luke
Kuechly,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/15/sports/football/luke-kuechly-concussions-retire.html)
the kind of player whose leadership and talent are impossible to
replace.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

### <span>**Seattle Seahawks**</span>

**Key move:** Trading for safety Jamal Adams.

**Outlook:** The margin between the Seahawks (11-5) and the 49ers last
season was thinner than their records would suggest, and with a few
breaks it would have been easy to envision Seattle reaching the Super
Bowl. Now the Seahawks have added safety Jamal Adams, one of the most
talented young defensive players in the N.F.L., and may give the N.F.C.
West its third conference champion in three years.

On offense, quarterback [Russell
Wilson](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/04/sports/football/russell-wilson-nfl-playoffs-2019.html)
is the star of the show, at least when [Coach Pete
Carroll](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/09/sports/football/seattle-seahawks-pete-carroll.html)
lets him have some fun. Wilson will get the ball to Tyler Lockett early
and often, though D.K. Metcalf has the makings of a superstar. With the
addition of tight end Greg Olsen and some serious depth at running back,
in the form of Chris Carson and backup Carlos Hyde, Seattle has an
offense that should terrify just about anyone.

On defense, the loss of end Jadeveon Clowney will be felt, but Adams is
so good that he should make everyone around him seem better.

### <span>**San Francisco 49ers**</span>

**Key move:** Trading for left tackle Trent Williams.

**Outlook:** If a [third-down pass to Emmanuel
Sanders](https://sports.yahoo.com/emmanuel-sanders-like-most-49-ers-fans-still-thinks-about-that-overthrown-jimmy-g-pass-late-in-super-bowl-loss-223945303.html)
had hit its mark in the fourth quarter, the 49ers (13-3) would probably
have been Super Bowl champions. But quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s throw
sailed a bit too long, and that gave Patrick Mahomes all the room he
needed to seal a comeback victory.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Super Bowl hangovers are typical, and the 49ers may very well experience
one early in the season thanks to injuries to key players like center
Weston Richburg and wide receiver Deebo Samuel. But the team did an
excellent job addressing the small amount of turnover it had, replacing
defensive lineman DeForest Buckner with Javon Kinlaw, wide receiver
Emmanuel Sanders with Brandon Aiyuk and, most important, left tackle Joe
Staley with the future Hall of Famer Trent Williams.

The team’s [biggest strength was Nick
Bosa](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/11/sports/football/49ers-nick-bosa.html)
and a fabulously deep defensive line, so Kinlaw’s needing some time to
learn shouldn’t be an issue. And the team’s offense should be bolstered
by Garoppolo’s being closer to full speed after a long recovery from an
A.C.L. tear in 2018. With tight end George Kittle around, just about
anything is
possible.

### <span>**Arizona Cardinals**</span>

**Key move:** Traded for wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins.

**Outlook:** Kyler Murray may fit inside Jared Goff’s pocket, but
Arizona’s teeny-tiny quarterback out of Oklahoma is a lot of fun to
watch. He seemed to be just barely scratching at his potential in his
rookie season for the Cardinals (5-10-1), and now can choose between
Larry Fitzgerald and Hopkins on every play. [Coach Kliff
Kingsbury](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/13/sports/air-raid-kliff-kingsbury-kyler-murray.html)
should have a lot of fun with that.

The Cardinals worked to address a depth issue on defense by focusing
their draft on that side of the ball, and a full season of cornerback
Patrick Peterson could go a long way toward getting the unit closer to
respectable.

That may not be enough to challenge Seattle or San Francisco, but the
Rams have to take a hard look at Arizona and wonder if all three teams
in the division have surpassed them.

### <span>**Los Angeles Rams**</span>

**Key move:** Drafting running back Cam Akers.

**Outlook:** Two years ago the [Rams (9-7) were the toast of the
N.F.L.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/02/02/sports/marcus-peters-rams.html),
celebrated as the league’s future. Every team wanted an offense just
like theirs and a [coach just as
young](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/31/sports/sean-mcvay-los-angeles-rams-super-bowl-liii.html)and
brash. Last year the Rams were 9-7 and missed the playoffs. This year
they might be the worst team in their division. A book should probably
be written about how quickly they were overtaken.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That isn’t to say that they will be all that bad. Quarterback Jared Goff
isn’t as dynamic as the game’s top signal-callers, but he’s plenty
productive. The team has some talented skill players on offense, and on
defense Los Angeles still has two of the best in the game — tackle
[Aaron
Donald](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/31/sports/football/aaron-donald-rams.html)
and cornerback Jalen Ramsey.

But while the Rams were standing pat and shedding expensive players, the
49ers and the Seahawks were rebuilding into powerhouses and the
Cardinals were sneaking up as a legitimate challenger. If the Rams can’t
rebound some this season, the blow to Coach Sean McVay’s reputation
could be enormous.
