Cup}\label{dustin-johnson-completes-long-climb-to-win-fedex-cup}}

Johnson was a long shot when the season resumed in June but took the
playoff's \$15 million prize after winning the Tour Championship, the
pinnacle of his mighty summer run.

ATLANTA --- Dustin Johnson hit his stride at just the right time and it
paid off in a big way.

Johnson finally won the FedEx Cup on Monday by holding his nerve,
hitting just enough fairways and making a few key putts when his lead
began to shrink. He tapped in for birdie on the last hole for a 2-under
68, giving him a three-shot victory over Justin Thomas and Xander
Schauffele in the Tour Championship.

Johnson won the \$15 million prize, the biggest in golf. Equally
important was getting his named etched on that silver FedEx Cup trophy
alongside some of the best from his generation, starting with Tiger
Woods and most recently Rory McIlroy.

``This is a tough golf course. No lead is safe,'' Johnson said. ``The
guys gave me a good fight today.''

He became the first No. 1 seed at the Tour Championship to win the FedEx
Cup since Tiger Woods in 2009.

Johnson was staked to a five-shot lead at 19-under-par --- 9-under on
his own score and starting the tournament at 10 under as the No. 1 seed
in the FedEx Cup.

He finished at 21-under.

Schauffele, who tends to bring his best to big moments, and Thomas each
got within three shots on the front nine. They both closed to within two
shots deep on the back nine at East Lake.

Johnson gave the lightest fist pump --- that's big emotion for him ---
when he holed a 20-foot par putt on the 13th hole that kept his lead at
three. He made nothing but pars on the back nine until the outcome was
no longer in doubt.

Thomas made bogey from a wild tee shot to the right on the 17th.
Schauffele also had to scramble on the 17th, escaping with par after a
tee shot into the bunker. And on the par-5 18th, Johnson unleashed a
drive that started left along the pine trees and faded gently toward the
middle of the fairway.

That set up a birdie from the front bunker, a hug with brother Austin,
his caddie, and a trophy he long wanted.

Schauffele had the lowest score over 72 holes at 15-under 265, but
without a victory this year, he started at No. 14 in the FedEx Cup,
spotting the world's No. 1 player seven shots.

Schauffele and Thomas tied for second, each earning \$4.5 million.

Jon Rahm, the No. 2 seed, closed with a 66 to finish fourth and earn \$3
million. Scottie Scheffler, who a year ago was getting ready to start
his rookie year, had a 66-65 finish and was fifth for a \$2.5 million
payoff.

And so wrapped up the strangest season on the PGA Tour, which doesn't
feel like the end at all except for the \$15 million awarded to Johnson,
\$14 million now and \$1 million deferred.

The new season starts Thursday. Two majors are still to be played.

Golf was shut down for three months and when it restarted, Johnson was
No. 111 in the FedEx Cup. He won the Travelers Championship and a month
later began a stretch that brought him to the prize he desperately
wanted.

In four straight tournaments against the best fields, he had the 54-hole
three times and was tied in the other. He converted one into an 11-shot
win. He lost to a 65 by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/08/sports/golf/pga-championship-dustin-johnson.html}{Collin
Morikawa at the P.G.A. Championship} and to a 65-foot putt by Rahm at
the BMW Championship.

He badly wanted the last one, and even staked to a five-shot lead to par
at East Lake, it was never easy.

Johnson made an 18-foot birdie early that was important because
Schauffele kept hitting it close. Johnson had consecutive birdies
through the par-5 sixth and his lead remained at five.

But he went well right off the tee at No. 7 and had to pitch back to the
fairway. He three-putted from 55 feet on the fringe at No. 8 and dropped
another shot. The lead kept shrinking. Johnson rolled his long birdie
putt on the par-3 ninth some 7 feet by, and he made the par putt coming
back to keep his lead at 3.

No putt was bigger than the 13th, when his lead was down to two shots
over Schauffele. Johnson went from left rough to right of the green and
chipped weakly to 20 feet. He drilled the par putt, restored the lead to
three and was on his way.

``It's a very tough trophy to win,'' Johnson said. ``I controlled my own
destiny, but I still had to go out and play well. I had a lot of great
players right behind me. It got close at the end. I knew it was going to
come down the stretch and I'd have to hit some golf shots.''
