# Bishop-Elect Resigns After Being Accused of Sexually Abusing a Minor

</div>

Father Michel J. Mulloy was chosen by Pope Francis to lead the Diocese
of Duluth, Minn., but then an allegation from the 1980s surfaced, church
officials said.

Pope Francis on Monday accepted the resignation of a priest whom he had
chosen to become the bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese in Duluth,
Minn., after a nearly 40-year-old allegation of sexual abuse of a minor
emerged against the clergyman, church officials said.

The priest, Father Michel J. Mulloy, 67, had been scheduled to be
installed on Oct. 1 as the bishop of the diocese, which estimated that
it [serves about 56,000
Catholics](https://www.dioceseduluth.org/About-Us) at 92 parishes in
northeastern
Minnesota.

But a little more than two weeks after his June 19 appointment by the
pope, the Diocese of Rapid City in South Dakota, where Father Mulloy had
been serving as diocesan administrator, was alerted about a [sexual
abuse
allegation](https://www.rapidcitydiocese.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Statement-MM4.pdf)
against him from the 1980s, church officials said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The bishop-elect’s resignation came after the Vatican in July told
bishops around the world to [report cases of clerical sex
abuse](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/world/europe/vatican-new-sex-abuse-rules.html)
to the civil authorities, part of an ongoing and contentious [effort by
Francis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/09/world/europe/pope-francis-abuse-catholic-church.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
to confront a blight on the Catholic Church.

Father James B. Bissonette, the diocesan administrator for the Diocese
of Duluth, [announced Father Mulloy’s
resignation](https://www.dioceseduluth.org/blog/Daily-News/statement-regarding-the-resignation-of-bishop-elect-michel-mulloy)
in a statement on Monday.

“We grieve with all who have suffered sexual abuse and their loved
ones,” Father Bissonette said. “I ask you to pray for the person who
has come forward with this accusation, for Father Mulloy, for the
faithful of our diocese, and for all affected.”

The Diocese of Rapid City said it informed law enforcement about the
allegation and told Father Mulloy to refrain from engaging in ministry
while an independent investigation that it had commissioned was
conducted.

Based on the findings of that inquiry, the diocese said, the allegation
was referred to a lay-majority diocesan review panel, which concluded
that it warranted further investigation under canon law. The diocese
said it brought the allegation to the attention of the pope.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Father Mulloy did not respond to a phone message seeking comment on
Monday, and the diocese did not provide further details about the
allegation. It was not immediately clear what capacity Father Mulloy was
serving in at the time.

The Rapid City Police Department did not respond to a request for
comment on Monday, but told The Associated Press that it had [no report
of allegations against Father
Mulloy](https://apnews.com/22a3998a4fe521384c6beabd44013764).

Father Mulloy, a South Dakota native, was ordained in 1979, according to
a post on the website of the Diocese of Sioux Falls [announcing his
appointment as a
bishop](https://www.sfcatholic.org/bishopsbulletin/pope-francis-names-father-michel-mulloy-of-diocese-of-rapid-city-as-bishop-of-duluth/).

His first assignment was at the [Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual
Help](https://www.cathedralolph.org/) in Rapid City from 1979 to 1981.
He was then assigned to [Christ the King
Parish](http://www.ctkparish-sf.org/) in Sioux Falls and held positions
at several other parishes in South Dakota during the 1980s.

The bishop’s post in the Diocese of Duluth has been vacant since last
December, when Bishop Paul D. Sirba, 59, [died of a heart attack before
offering
Mass](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/duluths-bishop-paul-sirba-dies-unexpectedly-at-59-15815),
the Catholic News Agency reported. Father Bissonette will continue to
serve as diocesan administrator until the pope appoints a new bishop.
