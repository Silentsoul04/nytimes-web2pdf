The vice-presidential candidates will be on opposite ends of Wisconsin,
a battleground that is increasingly essential to President Trump in
November.

LA CROSSE, Wis. --- Labor Day is the traditional kickoff to the fall
campaign season, but this year the holiday represents something more:
the first time both candidates for vice president will be on the trail
on the same day in the same state.

Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris on Monday will be on
opposite ends of Wisconsin, a battleground that's increasingly essential
to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html}{President
Trump}'s electoral map.

\subsection{Why Badgerland matters}\label{why-badgerland-matters}}

There were a few more competitive states in 2016, but no loss was as
devastating to Democrats as Wisconsin. Michigan they saw coming and
raced in vain to salvage at the end of the race, sending former
President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton herself for 11th-hour
rallies. And Democrats never took Pennsylvania for granted, with Mrs.
Clinton and Mr. Obama concluding the campaign in Philadelphia on the eve
of the election.

But Mrs. Clinton, confident in success after Mr. Obama carried the state
twice with ease, (in)famously did not campaign in Wisconsin in the final
stretch of the campaign. Mr. Trump captured just 47 percent of the vote,
but that was enough to win the state
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/elections/2016/results/wisconsin}{by
less than 23,000 votes}. The race in Wisconsin, it turned out, was truer
to what happened in 2000 and 2004, when the results were similarly
close, than to Mr. Obama's anomalous margins.

Much to the relief of Wisconsin Democrats,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html}{Joseph
R. Biden Jr.} is not taking the state for granted. In his first
coronavirus-era campaign trip outside Delaware and Pennsylvania --- his
home and neighboring states --- the former vice president
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/politics/joe-biden-kenosha.html}{visited
Kenosha, Wis., last week}, meeting with the family of Jacob Blake, the
Black man shot by the police last month.

Yet while Democrats would relish reclaiming Wisconsin, it's more
imperative for Mr. Trump to keep it in his column. If he holds every
other state he captured in 2016, the president must win at least one of
the three pivotal Big Ten states to claim re-election: Michigan,
Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. With his campaign increasingly concerned
about his ability to win again in Michigan, where it has cut its
advertising, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania loom even larger. And if Mr.
Biden can run just slightly stronger in the state of his birth and early
childhood than Mrs. Clinton did and win Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump's hopes
may rest entirely on Wisconsin.

Mr. Pence and Ms. Harris will spend the day in very different parts of
the state with very different audiences.

The vice president is speaking to employees at the Dairyland Power
Cooperative in La Crosse, a heavily white Mississippi River city at the
western edge of the state. Ms. Harris, who is making her first trip to a
battleground state since joining the Democratic ticket, is visiting with
union workers and leaders as well as African-American businesspeople and
pastors in Milwaukee, the Black hub of the state.

Each is expected to focus on the economy, with Mr. Pence hailing the
state's job growth before the coronavirus pandemic and Ms. Harris
critiquing the administration's handling of the virus and the resultant
impact on the economy.

Yet their political missions are different. The vice president is hoping
to appeal to voters in a historically Democratic part of Wisconsin,
where Mr. Trump outperformed his Republican predecessors, in hopes they
abandon their political roots again. Ms. Harris, for her part, is not
traveling to heavily Democratic Milwaukee to win over Republicans. She's
hoping to rouse Black Democrats in a city where far fewer of them showed
up in 2016 than in Mr. Obama's two winning campaigns.

\hypertarget{harris-makes-a-swing-state-debut}{%
\subsection{Harris makes a swing-state
debut}\label{harris-makes-a-swing-state-debut}}

Ms. Harris has appeared with Mr. Biden a few times in Delaware,
delivered a speech in Washington and conducted some carefully selected
interviews. But for the most part, she has receded from view in the
weeks since
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/us/politics/kamala-harris-vp-biden.html}{her
splashy selection}. That's not terribly surprising --- running mates
usually draw the most attention in the days immediately after they're
picked, and Mr. Trump overwhelms political news coverage.

Still, Ms. Harris's trip on Monday will be the first time she has
appeared with battleground state voters and, really, the first time she
has been in any sort of spontaneous setting since she was chosen. Such
forums are not her forte --- she's better working from prepared remarks
--- so Mr. Biden's top aides will be keeping a close eye on how closely
she sticks to her talking points. That could help shape the nature of
the events she does in the final stretch of the campaign.
