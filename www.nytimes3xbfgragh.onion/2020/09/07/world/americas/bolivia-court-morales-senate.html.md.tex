LA PAZ, Bolivia --- A Bolivian court on Monday rejected a legal appeal
by former president Evo Morales, deeming him ineligible to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/04/world/americas/bolivia-evo-morales-senate.html}{run
for a Senate position} in an October election re-run of a voided vote
late last year.

Mr. Morales cannot be a Senate candidate for his Movement for Socialism
party because he does not meet the residency requirements, Judge Alfredo
Jaimes told local media.

Mr. Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, held power for 14
years before
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/10/world/americas/evo-morales-bolivia.html}{stepping
down last year} when a disputed election sparked widespread protests.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/16/world/americas/bolivia-anez-morales.html}{Jeanine
Añez} has served as interim president since Mr. Morales resigned last
November.

The former president, now living in exile in Argentina, was barred from
running for president again in the next general election, which was
initally scheduled for May but has been delayed until Oct. 18 due to the
coronavirus pandemic.

The court's decision upholds a previous block on Mr. Morales's candidacy
by Bolivia's electoral tribunal in February and cannot be appealed.
