## For reopened U.S. universities, parties and pushback are upending plans.

As more U.S. universities and colleges try to reopen with in-person
instruction,
[outbreaks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/06/us/colleges-coronavirus-students.html),
student parties and pushback from instructors and students are
threatening their plans.

More than 51,000 cases have been reported at more than 1,000 campuses.
Some students have faced serious consequences for breaking the rules.
Northeastern University in Massachusetts dismissed 11 students last week
for violating safety precautions. New York University, Ohio State,
Purdue and West Virginia University have all suspended students over
violations of rules intended to curb the virus’s spread on campus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Monday, W.V.U. said that it was moving all undergraduate courses
online through Sept. 25 at its Morgantown campus, following reports of
parties held over the Labor Day weekend that surfaced on social media.

Coronavirus testing at the university has found [a growing number of
cases](https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus/daily-test-results/morgantown#daily-campus-testing),
including 112 new positive results between Aug. 30 and Sept. 3. Against
that backdrop, the reports of parties prompted officials to take action.
In a statement, the school’s dean of students, Corey Farris, [asked
students who traveled home for the
weekend](https://wvutoday.wvu.edu/stories/2020/09/07/wvu-moves-undergraduate-classes-online-through-sept-25-on-morgantown-campus-reduces-in-person-activities)
to stay there and not return to campus yet.

Two of the parties that raised concern were held Friday and Saturday
nights by the school’s Theta Chi fraternity chapter, in apparent
violation of orders from the university that members living in the
fraternity house isolate or quarantine themselves after one member
tested positive. The university announced on Saturday that 29 members of
the fraternity [had been issued immediate interim
suspensions](https://wvutoday.wvu.edu/stories/2020/09/06/wvu-suspends-29-students-for-covid-19-related-violations-additional-sanctions-pending).

Another Theta Chi chapter, at the University of New Hampshire, was
placed under interim suspension over the weekend after 11 coronavirus
cases were linked to an Aug. 29 party attended by more than 100 people,
according to a [letter from the university’s president, James
Dean](https://www.unh.edu/president/president-dean-condemns-covid-cluster-theta-chi-fraternity),
who called the party “reprehensible.”

At the University of Michigan, a labor union representing
graduate-student instructors and assistants said it would go on strike
Tuesday over virus safety and other concerns.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The union, GEO, submitted a letter signed by 1,800 people to university
administrators calling for a “safe and just pandemic response for all,”
including the right to work remotely. The letter also demands that the
university sever its ties with the Ann Arbor Police Department and ICE,
arguing that the university’s decision “to expand the policing of our
community in a perverse effort to enforce social distancing” would be
harmful to mental health on campus.

Rick Fitzgerald, the university’s assistant vice president for public
affairs, said that most of the union’s demands were “not appropriate”
now, and that a strike would violate state law as well as the union
contract. The university intended to hold classes in any event, he said.

A student group at the University of Kansas, where there are nearly 500
cases, is planning a “strike” to push the university to move to remote
learning, [The Kansas City Star
reported](https://www.kansascity.com/news/coronavirus/article245534890.html);
this follows a similar “sickout” last week at the University of
Iowa.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, declared on Tuesday that the country’s
success in suppressing its coronavirus outbreak was a vindication of
Communist Party rule.

Mr. Xi spoke during a televised ceremony to honor doctors, nurses, local
officials and others who party officials said had made an outstanding
contribution in fighting the virus, which first spread in central China
late last year. He said that the crisis had ignited a patriotic surge
that bolstered the party.

“The great strategic outcomes achieved in the struggle against the new
coronavirus have fully demonstrated the clear superiority of Communist
Party leadership and our socialist system,” Mr. Xi said, addressing rows
of award recipients in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Xi’s triumphant account would probably have drawn much wider
skepticism in China earlier this year, when many people were angered by
officials who understated the spread of infections in Wuhan, where the
epidemic took off. But the public mood shifted as China emerged from the
crisis far more smoothly than the United States and other advanced
economies did.

Near the start of Tuesday’s meeting, the thousands in the hall observed
a minute or so of silence to mourn the thousands who died in China from
the virus, including many medical workers. But online, Chinese people
lamented the lack of mention of [Li
Wenliang](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/07/world/asia/Li-Wenliang-china-coronavirus.html),
the Wuhan doctor who was chastised by the police for alerting his
colleagues to the then little-understood virus, and [later died from
Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/06/world/asia/chinese-doctor-Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html).

“Dr. Li, I thought your name should have been at the award day
ceremony,” said one of many similar comments on Dr. Li’s page on Sina
Weibo, a popular Chinese social media service.

Now China is trying to [turn attention to economic
recovery](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/business/china-xi-economy.html),
and the government has chosen an unusual set of volunteers to test a
coronavirus vaccine: its trade negotiators, who are more likely than
most Chinese to interact with potentially infected foreigners.

Chen Deming, a former commerce minister who is still active on trade
issues, was maskless when he took the podium at an economic policy
conference on Tuesday morning in Beijing. He drew laughter and applause
when he began by saying, “The host doesn’t have to wear a mask because
I’ve already had the Phase 3 trial vaccine shot.”

Mr. Chen, a Communist Party elder statesman who turns 71 this year,
added that he had developed antibodies to protect against the
coronavirus.

In a short interview after his speech, Mr. Chen said that he had
received the Sinopharm vaccine, one of several now in Phase 3 trials in
China. A third of the Commerce Ministry’s staff has joined him in
applying for the trial and receiving the vaccine, he added.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China’s vaccine makers have been turning to Chinese citizens who travel
overseas, and to countries such as Brazil and Indonesia, in their search
for people with whom to test whether their products work.

“For those people who have a high overseas or travel exposure, they have
a high priority to receive the vaccine,” said Wang Huiyao, the president
of the Center for China and Globalization, an influential Beijing
research group that organized the conference at which Mr. Chen
spoke.

Within those numbers are more complicated stories:

In May, the country was beginning to emerge from lockdown. The number of
overall deaths in the U.S. [was
nearing 100,000](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/24/us/us-coronavirus-deaths-100000.html).
And doctors were trying to find answers to a mysterious virus-related
ailment affecting children. The death toll in New York, once the center
of the virus outbreak, had dropped below 100 for the first time since
March.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Renu Kuinkel, 32, of Queens, said she and her husband tested positive in
the spring and have been largely staying home ever since. “It’s been
really bad,” she said.

This weekend, though, they [took a road
trip](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/us/virus-laborday-travel-reststop-newjersey.html)
to Maryland. “Now we are feeling fine with the kids,” Ms. Kuinkel said.
“It’s been hard, but a little bit fun, too.”

Most parents and children are now in the early stages of another round
of online learning. Many colleges and universities have welcomed
students back. The country is mostly open. And New York, once the
hottest of hot spots, announced that the positivity rate for the state
had remained under 1 percent for the past month.

Still, cases are rising in the Midwest and the western New York state
region. A big [school district outside
Buffalo](https://cms5.revize.com/revize/williamsvilleschools/Departments/Communications/2020-2021/SGM%20Letters/9-4-20%20Update%20to%20Families%20Delayed%20Reopening.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3IZDGyUkVTOELjggj2i-yP4pCEE4DtuDoKYBZ_yF36cdVzLkshIOnUpYY),
Williamsville, announced a delay for the start of online-only
instruction for students in grades 5-12 after higher than expected
demand, while nearly 100 staff members took a leave of absence and more
than 100 resigned. On Monday, the [school board
voted](https://www.wivb.com/news/top-stories/williamsville-places-superintendent-on-administrative-leave/)
to place the superintendent on administrative leave.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration, said on Sunday that exhaustion with social distancing
and other measures meant to slow the spread of the pandemic is a
potentially serious problem as the seasons change.

“In the wintertime, you see respiratory pathogens spread more
aggressively, in part because people are indoors more,” he
[added](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-scott-gottlieb-discusses-coronavirus-on-face-the-nation-september-6-2020/)
in an appearance on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “They’re in congregate
settings where respiratory pathogens can spread more efficiently.”

Thousands of trainee doctors in South Korea returned to work on Tuesday,
ending a two-and-a-half-week strike that had complicated efforts to
battle the coronavirus at a critical point in the outbreak.

Intern and resident doctors went on strike on Aug. 21 to protest the
government’s medical reform program, which included plans to increase
the number of medical school students and open public medical schools.
The walkout caused delays ​at major hospitals — where nurses, intern and
resident doctors form the backbone of emergency rooms and intensive care
units​ — even as the government [battled a second wave of
infections](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-church-sarang-jeil.html).

The government wants to increase the number of doctors to better handle
emergencies, including Covid-19, and to provide greater medical access
in rural areas. But young doctors said the country already had enough
physicians and that the proposed reforms would result in more doctors in
big cities like Seoul, where many of them specialize in popular and
lucrative specialties like plastic surgery, dermatology and dentistry.

The Korea Medical Association, a lobby for doctors, reached a deal last
Friday to end the strike after the government agreed to shelve its
reform programs and review them from scratch after the pandemic ends.
But the young doctors stayed on strike for a few more days, saying they
had not been consulted.

They returned to work on Tuesday, but many medical students are still
refusing to take final licensing exams​ scheduled for this week,​
​demanding a firmer commitment from the government not to push its
reform program.

South Korea’s second wave has been linked to churches and a large

number of new cases in the country, which was below 100 for months, has
soared to three-digit spikes​ per day since mid August. The government
reported 136 new cases​ on

Economists warn that further state spending reductions could prolong the
downturn by shaking the confidence of residents, whose day-to-day lives
depend heavily on state and local services like education, public
safety, health care and unemployment insurance.

“People look to government as their backstop when things are completely
falling apart,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
“If they feel like there’s no support there, they lose faith and they
run for the bunker and pull back on everything.”

State officials say they have little choice but to keep cutting if more
aid doesn’t arrive.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has warned that without further relief New York
will cut $8.2 billion in grants to local governments, a blow he said had
“no precedent in modern times.” The cuts would hit “nearly every
activity funded by state government,” including special education,
pediatric health care, substance abuse programs, property-tax relief and
mass transit, he said.

The state faces a $14.5 billion budget gap this fiscal year, according
to budget officials. As an alternative to more cuts, [progressive
Democrats have proposed taxing the
rich](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/nyregion/wealth-tax-budget-billionaires.html).

Mr. Cuomo, however, says the potential benefit of new revenue from doing
so would be far outstripped by the negative impact on the state’s
highest earners, who already shoulder the bulk of the state’s taxes.

“I don’t care what you increase taxes to, you couldn’t make up that
deficit,” Mr. Cuomo said last week upon releasing a letter asking
congressional leaders for a whopping $59 billion to cover two years of
projected state deficits and more.

Spain surpassed more than 525,000 total cases on Monday, according to a
[New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/spain-coronavirus-cases.html),
making it the only country in western Europe to exceed the half-million
mark.

The country is experiencing [a second wave of
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/world/europe/coronavirus-covid-spain-second-wave.html)
after a relative lull during the summer, and the virus is spreading much
faster there than anywhere else on the continent.

Spain was already [one of the hardest-hit countries in
Europe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/world/europe/spain-coronavirus.html).
But after one of the world’s most stringent lockdowns, which checked the
virus’s spread, the country enjoyed one of the most rapid reopenings.

The return of nightlife and group activities — which came far faster
than for most of its European neighbors — has contributed to the
epidemic’s resurgence in Spain. Government officials have announced that
schools will reopen this month, with masks obligatory for students 6 and
older.

Many doctors and politicians are not as terrified by Spain’s second wave
as they were by its first. The mortality rate is roughly half of what it
was at the height of its crisis — falling to 6.6 percent from the 12
percent peak in May — and the median age of people who tested positive
has dropped to around 37 from 60.

Still, experts fear that the growing number of cases could signal a new
surge across the continent.

In other developments around the world:

  - **Japan** on Tuesday approved a plan to spend more than $6 billion
    from its emergency budget reserves on coronavirus vaccines. The
    chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, [told
    reporters](http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/tyoukanpress/202009/8_a.html)
    that AstraZeneca had agreed to supply 120 million doses starting
    from early 2021, and that Pfizer would supply 120 million doses by
    the end of June. Mr. Suga said the government was also negotiating
    with Moderna for more than 40 million additional doses.

  - **Hong Kong** will expand the size of legal public gatherings to
    four from two on Friday, as the Chinese territory loosens
    restrictions that it imposed this summer to fight a third wave of
    infections. More sports and entertainment venues will also be
    allowed to reopen.

  - **Denmark** announced on Monday that the limit on the size of public
    gatherings would be lowered from 100 to 50 in Copenhagen and other
    cities in response to a rise in cases. The measures were announced
    by the country’s health minister and will be implemented on Sept. 9
    for 17 municipalities, including Odense, Denmark’s third largest
    city. In addition to the new limits on the size of assemblies, bars
    and restaurants will have to close by midnight, Magnus Heunicke, the
    minister of health and elderly affairs, said during a news
    conference.

Used cars are usually overlooked in the fanfare accorded to
[cutting-edge electric
cars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/business/tesla-electric-car-audi-polestar.html)
and [gussied-up pickup
trucks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/15/automobiles/wheels/luxury-trucks-suv.html).
Now they are suddenly [the industry’s hottest
commodity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/business/used-cars-pandemic.html).

Consumers are snapping up used vehicles as second or third cars so they
can [avoid trains,
buses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/19/us/coronavirus-public-transit.html)
or Ubers during the coronavirus pandemic. Others are buying used rather
than new to save money in an uncertain economy, not knowing when they or
their spouse might lose a job. Demand for older cars has also been fed
by a roughly two-month [halt in production of new
cars](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/business/economy/gm-ford-fiatchrysler-factories-virus.html)
this spring.

Across the United States, the prices of used cars have shot up. The
increase defies the conventional wisdom that cars are depreciating
assets that lose a big chunk of their value the moment they leave the
dealership. In July alone, the average value of used cars jumped more
than 16 percent, according to Edmunds.com.

In June, the most recent month for which data is available, franchised
car dealers sold 1.2 million used cars and trucks, according to Edmunds,
up 22 percent from a year earlier. It was the highest monthly total
since at least 2007.

The boom has turned the business of selling cars upside down. Because
used cars don’t come from factories in Detroit, dealers are having to
work as hard to buy cars as they typically do to sell them, they say,
including running ads and cold calling people to ask if they would be
interested in selling their old car. That’s how strong demand for used
cars has become in the pandemic.

“Used cars are supposed to depreciate, but I’d look up the book value of
a car on the lot and see it was higher than at the beginning of the
month,” said Adam Silverleib, president of Silko Honda in Raynham, Mass.
“I’ve never seen that before.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Silverleib recently sold a 2017 Honda Pilot with 22,000 miles to
Suzanne Cray and her husband. The family had gotten by with just one
car. But Ms. Cray, a nurse who works at Tufts Medical Center in Boston,
said the family had decided it needed another to ensure that no one had
to [ride with
Uber](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/technology/the-results-are-in-for-the-sharing-economy-they-are-ugly.html)
or on public transportation.

The boom is of a piece with other unexpected trends in a recession that
has left millions of people unemployed and has devastated airlines,
restaurants, hotels and small businesses. Despite that pain, the
pandemic has been a boon to old standbys of the economy, like [canned
and processed
foods](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/business/coronavirus-processed-foods.html)
and [suburban home
sales](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/30/nyregion/nyc-suburbs-housing-demand.html),
that had fallen out of favor in recent years.

The growing desire to own a car has caught many people by surprise and
unnerved others who are worried about what it might say about the future
of cities and transportation. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who gets around in
an S.U.V., recently implored New Yorkers, many of whom don’t own
vehicles, not to buy a car, saying they [represent “the
past.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/style/car-buying-new-york-coronavirus.html)

        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Natalie Lambert, a health researcher at Indiana University School of
Medicine, recently
[surveyed](https://precisionhealth.iu.edu/news-multimedia/_news/lambert-covid-symptom-study-doc.pdf)
more than 1,500 long-haul patients through the Survivor Corps Facebook
page and found a number of common psychological symptoms. She found that
anxiety was the eighth most common long-haul symptom, cited by more than
700 respondents. Difficulty concentrating was also high on the list, and
more than 400 reported feeling “sadness.”

Dr. Teodor Postolache, a psychiatrist at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine, estimates that between one-third and one-half of
Covid-19 patients experienced some form of mental health problems
including anxiety, depression, fatigue or abnormal sleeping.

“I’ve had three OK days, but I’m hesitant to share that, because it
could go away,” Ms. Smith said. “Long-haulers will tell you that. We
preface every conversation when we feel good with, ‘I’ll regret saying
this
tomorrow.’”

Despite a resurgence of the virus in France, officials from the French
Tennis Federation announced on Monday that they will allow spectators at
the French Open, which will take place from Sept. 27 to Oct. 11. The
plans have been scaled back, however, to 11,500 people a day.

Roland Garros stadium, where the tournament is held, stretches across
almost 30 acres and will be split into three separate zones. The two
larger ones will allow 5,000 people each; the third will allow 1,500.
Normally, the stadium holds about 35,000 people.

“The French Tennis Federation, with advice from a committee of expert
scientists, is acting responsible and in close collaboration with the
French government authorities to draw up a strict protocol that will
ensure the health and safety of everyone who is on site at Roland Garros
stadium during the tournament,” the officials said.

The U.S. Open is currently underway at the Billie Jean King National
Tennis Center in Queens, but without any fans in the stadium. The French
Open, usually played in late May, was pushed to September because of the
pandemic.

[In early
July](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/sports/tennis/french-open-fans.html?searchResultPosition=3),
Bernard Giudicelli, the president of the French Tennis Federation, said
the tournament may be able to accommodate 20,000 fans per day. At that
time, the seven-day average for the daily number of new cases was about
700, [according to a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/france-coronavirus-cases.html).
In the two months since, the seven-day average has risen to more than
5,000, rivaling the first peak of cases in April. On Friday alone, there
were nearly 9,000 new cases.

Spectators will not be able to move between zones of the stadium and
everyone over the age of 11 will have to wear face
coverings.

## Skyrocketing cases push India to No. 2 on the pandemic list.

India, home to the world’s fastest-growing outbreak, has surpassed
Brazil to become the country with the second-highest number of cases.

On Monday, India reported 90,802 new cases, breaking its own record from
the day before and taking its total to more than 4.2 million, according
to a [New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html).
Brazil is now third with more than 4.1 million cases.

In early July, India surpassed Russia to become the country with the
third-highest number of cases. By then, the United States was entrenched
at No. 1, where it remains, with more than 6.2 million cases.

“Crowded cities, lockdown fatigue and a lack of contact tracing have
spread Covid-19 to every corner of this country of 1.3 billion people,”
The Times’s Jeffrey Gettleman and Sameer Yasir
[reported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/world/asia/india-coronavirus.html)
in late August.

India has recorded 71,642 deaths from the virus, the world’s
third-highest toll after the United States and Brazil, though as a
youthful nation India has a relatively low death rate per capita.

India’s surge in cases comes as the government continues to ease
lockdown measures in an effort to help the economy. On Monday, the
subway system in New Delhi, the capital, began a [phased
reopening](http://www.delhimetrorail.com/press_reldetails.aspx?id=YEUIu1E8HMklld)

The pandemic has been economically devastating for India, which not so

powerhouse](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/world/asia/india-economy-coronavirus.html).
Last week, the government [reported a 24 percent

in the second quarter, the worst among the world’s top
economies.

Pakistani officials said on Monday that they plan to open high schools
and universities across the country as of Sept. 15, encouraged by the
decline in cases over the past couple of months.

The seven-day average of new cases was [467 as of
Sunday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html),
according to a New York Times database (the average was not as of
Monday). Overall, Pakistan has had more than [298,000
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries).

“We have decided to open education institutions in a phased manner,”
Shafat Mehmood, the country’s education minister, said during a press
briefing in Islamabad, the capital.

Officials said they will monitor the situation for a week and, if things
remains under control, classes for younger children will begin on Sept.
23.

“It is a very big decision,” Mr. Mehmood said. “I want to thank the
parents and students who were very patient over the last six months.
These were difficult times.”

Pakistan has seven million students in high schools and universities,
and 6.4 million students in sixth through eighth grades, Mr. Mehmood
said.

The numbers of cases and deaths in the country have fallen steeply in
recent months. Cases rose sharply in the middle of June, leading to
fears that the country’s weak health care system would be unable to cope
with the pandemic. But officials said a coordinated national effort to
impose selective lockdowns and safety measures [led to decline in the
curve](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/world/asia/reopening-before-coronavirus-ends.html?searchResultPosition=20).

Health experts said that several other factors also helped stop the
spread of the disease. They have credited the country’s large youth
population and the existence of vaccination programs for diseases like
tuberculosis and leprosy. Still, there is no definitive answer as to why
Pakistan has been spared the kind of confirmed spread that has afflicted
other countries, like neighboring India.

Dr. Faisal Sultan, the special assistant to the prime minister of
health, said school authorities will work to ensure that social
distancing is maintained during classes.

“The most important role will be that of a mask,” Dr. Sultan said. He
added that students who are sick or have a cough or fever should stay
home.

“We cannot lower our guard,” he
said.

Myanmar’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, announced on Monday
that she was canceling her first planned campaign appearance because of
the spread of the virus, as officials said two members of her household
staff had tested positive.

Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a member of parliament who serves as state
counselor and foreign minister, is running for re-election in her
district in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, in national elections
scheduled for Nov. 8.

The isolated country, wedged between China, Bangladesh and Thailand, had
largely been spared from the virus until last month, when it began
spreading in Rakhine State in western Myanmar.

As of Aug. 20, the country had fewer than 400 cases. But by Monday, the
government reported more than 1,400 cases and eight deaths. Some
provinces have imposed travel restrictions on other regions, including
requiring visitors to undergo 21 days of quarantine upon arrival.

Officials said Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had not had personal contact
recently with the two staff members who tested positive at her lakeside
house in Yangon, where she spent 15 years under house arrest during
military rule.

In canceling her campaign kickoff appearance scheduled for Tuesday, she
said the minister of health, U Myint Htwe, had advised her against
traveling to her district from the capital, Naypyidaw, where she now
spends most of her time.

“At the moment the ministry of health is the most powerful,” she said in
a video appearance on Facebook. “We need to follow the instructions of
the ministry of health.

The recipient of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has
received widespread international condemnation for her refusal to defend
the Rohingya Muslims, the target of a genocidal campaign by the Myanmar
military with whom she now shares power.

About 1 million Rohingya have fled violence and persecution in Myanmar
to Bangladesh where they live in crowded refugee camps. Aid officials
there worry that they are highly vulnerable to the coronavirus.
