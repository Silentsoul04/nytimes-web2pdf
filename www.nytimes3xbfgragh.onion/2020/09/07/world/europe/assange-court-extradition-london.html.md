# Julian Assange Appears in London Court for U.S. Extradition Hearing

</div>

The case against the WikiLeaks founder, who is accused of obtaining and
publishing secret military and diplomatic documents, was delayed in
February because of the coronavirus pandemic.

LONDON — Julian Assange, the embattled founder of WikiLeaks, made his
first appearance in a London court in months on Monday, as an
evidentiary hearing began in his U.S. extradition case, a crucial moment
in a prolonged legal struggle that has spanned a decade.

In the hearings, Mr. Assange and his lawyers will argue against his
extradition on the American charges, which accuse Mr. Assange of
violating the Espionage Act. The charges stem from the publishing of
secret military and diplomatic documents by WikiLeaks in 2010.

The proceedings, which are expected to last until early October, had
been delayed for months because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr.
Assange, 49, [last appeared in a London courtroom in
February](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/24/world/europe/julian-assange-extradition-trial.html),
before the hearing was pushed back.

On Monday, Mr. Assange, cleanshaven and wearing a dark suit and a light
shirt, appeared at the Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey,
in central London. His lawyers said that it was the first time they had
seen him in person in six months. When asked whether he would consent to
be extradited to the United States, Mr. Assange replied simply, “No.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

His lawyers have framed the case as politically motivated, stating in
court documents that Mr. Assange would be unable to receive a fair trial
in the United States.

Mr. Assange was [arrested in
London](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/11/world/europe/julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuador-embassy.html)
last year when Ecuador [abruptly revoked his asylum and expelled him
from its
embassy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/11/world/europe/julian-assange-ecuador-asylum.html)
there after he had spent seven years holed up in the building.

The U.S. charges allege that Mr. Assange conspired with [Chelsea
Manning, a former Army intelligence
analyst](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/09/us/chelsea-manning-jail.html),
to hack into a Pentagon computer network, and that he then began
publishing the secret documents.

Ms. Manning was convicted at a court-martial in 2013 of leaking the
files. Mr. Assange was eventually [indicted by the United States on 17
counts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/23/us/politics/assange-indictment.html)
of violating the Espionage Act for his alleged role in soliciting,
obtaining, and sometimes publishing material that the U.S. government
deemed to be classified — all actions that reporters covering national
security issues do routinely.

From the start, the charges against Mr. Assange have raised [profound
First Amendment
issues](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/11/us/politics/assange-indictment.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer)
because his actions are difficult to distinguish in a legally meaningful
way from those of traditional news organizations. It would be
[unprecedented in American
law](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/23/us/politics/assange-indictment.html)
for such activity to result in criminal convictions, so press freedom
advocates have denounced the charges against him and have been watching
the case closely.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In June, the Department of Justice announced a new indictment to
supersede the charges against Mr. Assange, expanding the allegations
that he had conspired with members of hacking organizations and had
sought to recruit programmers to release classified information to
WikiLeaks. Mr. Assange faces up to 175 years in prison if found guilty
on all counts.

During Monday’s hearing, Mark Summers, a lawyer for Mr. Assange, called
the change “fundamentally unfair,” and cited it as a reason to adjourn
the hearing until January. But the judge said the hearing would proceed.

On Monday, the defense called its first witness, Mark Feldstein, a
professor at the University of Maryland and a former investigative
reporter, who appeared by video link.

He testified that the passing of leaked, classified information to news
organizations in the United States was common, saying that “some of the
most respected journalists in the nation” had made a career out of
receiving leaked information.

“Its routine, every government study in the last 60 years has said that
it is widespread, and these leaks, they shed light on decision making by
the government,” Mr. Feldstein said, noting that they have also “exposed
government deceit” and “go back to George Washington’s presidency.”

Mr. Feldstein also said that U.S. authorities had not pursued charges
against publishers of leaked information “because of fear of running
afoul of the free press clause in the Constitution.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Feldstein’s testimony was cut short by technical difficulties, so it
will continue later in the week, when additional witnesses are expected
to be called.

The street outside the central London court was crowded on Monday with
dozens of supporters banging drums and waving signs with messages
including “Don’t Extradite Assange” and “Free Assange.”

Vivienne Westwood, a British fashion designer who has [long been an
outspoken supporter of Mr.
Assange](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/style/vivienne-westwood-julian-assange.html),
was also in attendance, wearing a soccer jersey and cleats.

“For 10 years, the courts have been playing football with Julian’s
head,” Ms. Westwood said. “Sweden and the U.K. have been gaming the
law, moving the goal posts, holding Julian Assange for America for 10
years, waiting for America to get its act together.”

Mr. Assange’s father, John Shipton, also spoke to reporters outside the
courtroom, demanding that the extradition to the United States be
blocked.

“The administration of justice here is enfeebled,” he said, criticizing
Britain for its cooperation with the American extradition attempt. “We
insist upon the fair administration of law, and we insist that our
national boundaries be respected, and that will save Julian.”

Charlie Savage contributed reporting from Washington.
