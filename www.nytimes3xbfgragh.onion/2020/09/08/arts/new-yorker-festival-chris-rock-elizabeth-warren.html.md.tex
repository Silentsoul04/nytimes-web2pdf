A little under a month before Americans cast their ballots, they can be
a fly on the wall for a conversation between Senator Elizabeth Warren
and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The Democratic lawmakers will be interviewed together by The New
Yorker's Andrew Marantz as part of the 21st New Yorker Festival, which
will, for the first time, be a mostly virtual affair. A dozen talks,
panels and performances will be livestreamed on the festival website
from Oct. 5 to 11.

This year's lineup is packed with stars like Chris Rock, Steve Martin,
Yo-Yo Ma and Ira Glass. Attendees will also get a chance to hear from
Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been largely absent from national television
since May. He will talk with Michael Specter, a science writer.

Noah Hawley, the creator of the FX series ``Fargo,'' which returns Sept.
27, and Rock, this season's star, will be interviewed by the journalist
Doreen St. Félix. The comedians Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Martin will be
in dialogue with Susan Morrison, an editor at the magazine.

Viewers will also get the chance to hear several performances. The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/arts/music/five-minutes-classical-music-cello.html}{cellist
Ma} and the pianist Emanuel Ax will play following a chat with Alex
Ross, The New Yorker's music critic. Fiona Apple, who released her first
album in nearly a decade last spring, will perform after a chat with
Emily Nussbaum, who
\href{https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity}{profiled
her}in March.

Maya Rudolph, the actor and comedian who portrays the Democratic
vice-presidential contender Kamala Harris on ``Saturday Night Live,''
will be interviewed alongside
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/16/arts/television/natasha-lyonne-russian-doll-emmys.html}{Natasha
Lyonne,} who starred in the Netflix series ``Russian Doll.'' And
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/07/arts/design/mellon-foundation-president-elizabeth-alexander.html}{Elizabeth
Alexander}, the president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, will talk
with the civil rights lawyer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/23/books/review/just-mercy-bryan-stevenson.html}{Bryan
Stevenson} about social justice, in a free community event.

The festival will also host the premiere of Regina King's directorial
debut, ``One Night in Miami,'' at the Queens Drive-In on Oct. 11, at 8
p.m. The film, which explores a pivotal moment in the early life of
Muhammad Ali, will be followed by a prerecorded conversation between
King, Kemp Powers (who wrote the screenplay and the stage play the film
is based on) and The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick.

Attendees in the New York area can also order a dinner created by the
Harlem-based chefs Pierre Thiam and **** JJ Johnson any day that week.
Streaming access to a prerecorded conversation with Thiam, Johnson and
The New Yorker's food critic, Hannah Goldfield, is included with the
purchase.

Events will be available to stream through Oct. 13. A full lineup is at
\href{https://festival.newyorker.com/}{newyorker.com/festival}.
