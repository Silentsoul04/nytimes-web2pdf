****TWENTY AFTER MIDNIGHT****  
By Daniel Galera  
Translated by Julia Sanches  
217 pp. Penguin. Paper, $16.

It’s a sweltering summer in Porto Alegre, Brazil, made worse by the
stench of uncollected garbage and the simmering frustrations of a bus
strike. The dashed optimism of last year’s street protests, leading up
to the 2014 World Cup, still hangs over the city. For three former
college friends — Emiliano, Antero and Aurora — things only get grimmer
when they hear that Andrei Dukelsky has been gunned down in a robbery.
Dukelsky, “one of the most promising new talents of contemporary
Brazilian literature,” was the enigmatic ringleader who brought them all
together in the late 1990s to write for his pioneering webzine,
Orangutan*.*

So where does that leave the three of them now, as they reminisce in
middle age about those freewheeling days at the dawn of the internet
age? Emiliano, a hack journalist, wrestles with “the feeling I’d had
since turning 40 that I was already in the process of decomposing.”
Antero, a trendy marketing guru, clings to appearances of youth, while
cheating on his wife and engaging in epic bouts of masturbation. Aurora,
the most cynical of the group, is an ecological “doomsdayer” who plans
to flee to the forest and listen to “the distant echoes of
civilization’s demise” from there.

Galera is the author of several gritty novels set in contemporary Brazil
and one of Granta’s Best Young Brazilian novelists; he writes with a
heady, voracious energy captured in robust prose by Sanches. Masterfully
picking away at the impotence and disappointments of this aging band of
literary provocateurs, Galera presents a vision of failed promise — of a
generation and country — that is as sordid and rotting as the streets of
Porto Alegre.

****THAT TIME OF YEAR****

“That Time of Year,” by the prolific, genre-defying French-Senegalese
author NDiaye, also takes place in summer — or rather, the days right
after a summer holiday’s end. The Parisians Herman and his wife, Rose,
have been vacationing in the same rural town in southern France for the
past 10 years, but when they decide to stay one day longer — until Sept.
1 — everything takes a sinister twist.

What a difference a day makes\! Soon, a cold rain and fog descend; then,
Rose and their 8-year-old son go missing. Herman wanders the streets in
search of his family, spied on suspiciously by the townspeople and
gripped by a growing panic. It’s as if he’s unwittingly stepped onto a
Jordan Peele set*.* “Everything’s turned hostile all of a sudden,” he
mutters to himself. “Is it because I’ve seen the fall, is this the price
you have to pay?”

Herman is given the runaround by vacant-looking, Kafkaesque officials in
matching outfits and unnaturally yellow hair, before moving into a local
hotel to better get the lay of the land. Meanwhile, he feels himself
metamorphosing: “Like that morning, everything inside him seemed damp
and mortified, shrunken, slowly rotting.” More than just losing his
mind, he seems to be physically melting away, succumbing to a “dulled,
larval inertia.”

NDiaye’s slim novel, first published in France in 1994 and translated by
Stump in a sly, deceptive monotone, is a worthy addition to her oeuvre.
For all its elements of pyschological horror, there is something
hauntingly real to NDiaye’s world, where “pale, serene, detached,
smiling faces hid an inconsolable sorrow.”

****THE SWORD AND THE SPEAR****

The Mozambican writer Couto, winner of the 2014 Neustadt International
Prize for Literature, has built up his own extraordinary body of work
exploring the wounds and dreams of his native land, in books such as
“Every Man Is a Race,” “A River Called Time,” “The Tuner of Silences”
and “Confessions of the Lioness.” His work is every bit as bewitching as
the titles suggest.

“The Sword and the Spear,” the second volume in a historical trilogy,
continues the saga of the final confrontations between Portuguese
colonial armies and Ngunganyane, king of the Gaza empire, in
late-19th-century Mozambique. Like “Woman of Ashes,” the first volume,
the new novel unfolds in a series of letters, mainly between Sgt.
Germano de Melo, a reluctant soldier besotted with a young VaChopi girl
named Imani, and the careerist Lt. Ayres de Ornelas. Their
correspondence is interspersed with the voice of Imani herself, and here
is where Couto’s storytelling truly soars (poetically rendered from the
Portuguese by Brookshaw).

As the novel opens, Imani is accompanying the wounded de Melo down the
Inharrime River to a hospital. “Everything always begins with a
farewell,” she writes. “This story begins with an ending: the end of my
adolescence.” On the way, they hole up at a former Catholic mission,
where she reunites with the Goan priest who trained her “to be white” as
a young girl at convent school. As in all his books, Couto calls into
question the very essence of race and identity, belief and belonging, in
Mozambique and beyond. “So you’ve discovered you want to be African?”
the priest asks Imani. “I’m curious, my daughter. What is it to be
African?”

Teresa, the narrator of Giordano’s bighearted novel “Heaven and Earth,”
is barely a teenager when she first encounters the three boys who will
alter the course of her life. Bern, Nicola and Tommaso live in the
*masseria* — part-farmhouse, part-religious order — next door to
Teresa’s grandmother’s home in southern Italy, which Teresa visits
each summer from Turin. Bern, especially, makes a powerful impression.
Passionate and intense, he is eager to “storm the heavens.”

Like Galera, Giordano follows the trajectories of his characters over
the course of several decades, beginning in the mid-90s. But his book is
less about a generation’s decline than about the tangle of emotions and
rivalries that play out between friends. Teresa and Bern are soon
inseparable, and, in their 20s, become the heart of a homesteading
collective at the *masseria*.

There are obstacles to their dreams of a green utopia — local
capitalists, for one, and the police, for another. Internal divisions,
too, drive a wedge between them, with tragic results. Ultimately, Bern’s
passion is all-consuming. “At that moment I felt the frightening
immensity of the love he had inside,” Teresa says. “It wasn’t just about
the trees, it was about everything and everyone, and it didn’t let him
breathe, it was suffocating him.”

Giordano is a fluid, expansive writer (smoothly translated by Appel):
The chapters flow effortlessly back and forth in time, pulling us deeper
into the story of Teresa and Bern’s great love. The Italian landscape
shimmers with their longing. “It all belonged to us,” Bern says. “The
trees and the stone walls. The heavens. Even the heavens belonged to us,
Teresa.”
