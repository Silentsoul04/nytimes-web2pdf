\textbf{WHAT ARE YOU GOING THROUGH}\\
By Sigrid Nunez

Reading Sigrid Nunez's absorbing new novel is somewhat akin to having a
long conversation with someone who is telling you something very
important, but is telling it in a very quiet voice. You have to really
pay attention. Be assured, however, that the experience will be worth
it. You will emerge calmer, meditative, more thoughtful, as if you have
benefited from an excellent literary massage of sorts.

In ``What Are You Going Through,'' Nunez tells the simplest of stories
--- about a woman accompanying a terminally ill friend through her last
months --- and expands it into an exploration of the largest of themes:
nothing less than the realities of living and dying in this world and
how we feel about both. In the opening pages, the woman goes to visit
her dying friend in the hospital and attends a talk at a local college
given by a famous academic we later discover is her ex. He is the author
of a viral article about the imminent apocalypse of climate change, how
``It was all over,'' that ``Our world and our civilization would not
endure'' and ``We must live and die in this new knowledge.'' He goes on
to say that it is useless ``to deny that suffering of immense magnitude
lay ahead, or that there'd be any escaping it.'' The stoic dispassion of
the speaker belies the horror of what he is foretelling, and the
narrator wonders if he will offer ``a crumb, if only a crumb it be, of
hope.''

This is, of course, a parallel to what the narrator's friend is
experiencing as she faces the end of her life. After recovering enough
to go home and plan how she wants the remainder of her life to be, she
decides to end her life on her own terms. To this end, the sick friend
persuades the narrator (the lack of names renders the prose plain-spoken
and somehow transcendent) to be her companion on her last chapter,
although she confides with an amused expression, ``I know your feelings
won't be hurt when I say that you weren't my first choice.'' After the
narrator agrees, the friend texts, ``I promise to make it as fun as
possible,'' then sends her photos of the house she wants to rent as if
they are going on vacation together.

Her sick friend is perhaps more ambivalent than she seems. Upon arriving
at the rental, she bursts into tears when she realizes she has forgotten
the pills back home. Later, pills safely retrieved, she curses at the
narrator for daring to suggest she might harbor any doubts. They settle
in to make the business of dying as pleasant as possible.

The specter of future generations hangs over all of these issues: the
moral question of whether to bring children into such a bleak and
foundering world. The ex (who becomes a somewhat regular confidant)
posits this as a moral dilemma; he is alienated from his son by having
been vocally appalled that he is choosing to have multiple children. The
friend's relationship with her daughter has been fraught since birth
(``I'd swear the kid was a changeling'') and they have minimal contact
or warmth. And there is an odd and distinct lack of pleasure in children
(``The truth is, every time I see a newborn now my heart sinks,'' the ex
admits), although it's more melancholy than misanthropic.

Like the best of our writers, Nunez is a bit of a seer and a prophet (to
wit: ``Salvation City,'' her 2010 novel about a flu pandemic), and so it
is discomfiting to imagine that what she presents here as the state of
the world could be true. It was with some relief I read these lines of
beauty and hope during the friends' stay in the house: ``Golden hour,
magic hour, \emph{l'heure bleue}. Evenings when the beauty of the
changing sky made us both go still and dreamy. Sunlight falling at an
angle across the lawn so that it touched our elevated feet, then moved
up our bodies like a long slow blessing.'' And then, at the end of this
elegant passage: ``Infinitely rich, infinitely beautiful. Everything was
going to be all right.''

As her friend moves inexorably closer to the end, they stop speaking as
``the farther along she was on her journey, the less she wanted to be
distracted.'' They are now back in the friend's apartment after an
accidental flood in the rental and the narrator spends her time quietly
ministering to her friend's needs. During this period, the narrator
vividly recalls past friends, past situations, as if vicariously
experiencing the flashes of one's past life that are said to occur on
the eve of death. Nunez's unerring and quietly observant eye burrows
further and further into these experiences as if they will unearth an
answer of sorts. And she realizes that ``this saddest time that has also
been one of the happiest times of my life will pass. And I'll be
alone.'' Beauty, friendship, nature, art: These are the salves to
loneliness and despair, and Nunez offers them all in this searching look
into life and death.
