Even as the coronavirus pandemic appears to recede in New York,
corporations have been [reluctant to call their workers
back](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/nyregion/nyc-phase-2-reopening-coronavirus.html)
to their skyscrapers and are showing even more hesitation about
committing to the city long term.

Fewer than 10 percent of New York’s office workers had returned as of
last month and just a quarter of major employers expect to bring their
people back by the end of the year, according to a new survey. Only 54
percent of these companies say they will return by July 2021.

Demand for office space has slumped. Lease signings in the first eight
months of the year were about half of what they were a year earlier.
That is putting the office market on track for a 20-year low for the
full year. When companies do sign, many are opting for short-term
contracts that most landlords would have rejected in February.

At stake is [New York’s financial
health](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/nyregion/coronavirus-work-from-home.html)
and its status as the world’s corporate headquarters. There is more
square feet of work space in the city than in London and San Francisco
combined, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage
firm. Office work makes up the cornerstone of New York’s economy and
property taxes from office buildings account for nearly 10 percent of
the city’s total annual tax revenue.

What is most unnerving is that a recovery could unfold much more slowly
than it did after the Sept. 11 attacks and the financial crisis of 2008.
That’s largely because the pandemic has prompted companies to

Robert Ivanhoe, a real estate lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, said he had
about 20 clients that had postponed searches for new offices. “They are
putting a lot of thought into coming up with a new operating model — how
much of my work force is going to work from home and for how much time?”
he said. “It has never been turned upside down like this before.”

Real estate data confirms that. The number of office leases signed from
January through August totaled 13.7 million square feet, less than half
as much as the first eight months of last year, according to Colliers
International, a real estate brokerage firm. By contrast, leasing hit an
18-year high at the end of last year with nearly 43 million square feet
of new leases and renewals.

“When it comes to making decisions about office leases, the words are
postpone, adjourn and delay,” said Ruth Colp-Haber, the chief executive
of Wharton Property Advisors, a real estate brokerage firm.

But the coronavirus abruptly shut New York down for several months, and
the company “hit pause” on its expansion, said Michael Wystrach,
Freshly’s founder and chief executive. The company is still
considering new office space, but he isn’t sure when it would sign a
lease. “We are long-term believers in New York City.”

During any weekday in Midtown, [the sidewalks are as
empty](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/26/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-time-life-building.html)
as they usually are on a Sunday, underscoring how few employees have
returned. In August, a
[survey](https://pfnyc.org/news/return-to-office-survey-released-from-partnership-for-new-york-city/)of
major employers by the Partnership for New York found only 8 percent of
employees had returned to the office and most expected to bring
employees back by next summer, and another quarter of them had not
decided when they would return.

Elected officials, real estate tycoons and [even Jerry
Seinfeld](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/opinion/jerry-seinfeld-new-york-coronavirus.html),
the comedian, have issued paeans to New York’s resilience, arguing that
city has a history of bouncing back. The city will soon be brimming with
people, by their
telling.

But pessimists — including some New York hedge fund managers — see dark
days ahead. They contend that companies will tell most employees to stay
away until a vaccine is widely distributed and perhaps for much longer.

Which of those two visions is closer to being right will help determine
how quickly New York regains its energy, economic health and tax
revenue.

Investors are not expecting a quick recovery. Shares of companies with
lots of New York office space like Empire State Realty Trust, which owns
the Empire State Building, and SL Green Realty, which owns the immense
new [One
Vanderbilt](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/17/nyregion/tower-grand-central.html)
tower next to Grand Central Terminal, have plunged this year.

“I think the New York office market is going to be generally challenged
for the next three to five years,” said Jonathan Litt, the founder of
the hedge fund Land & Buildings. His fund [published a report in
May](https://landandbuildings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/LandB-NYC-Office-Facing-Existential-Hurricane-1.pdf)
on why it thinks the shares of Empire State Realty Trust are overvalued.

A big part of the problem is that many companies are holding off on new
leases.

In recent years, the biggest renters of office space have been
co-working companies like WeWork, New York’s largest private tenant.
Such businesses signed nearly 8 percent of new leases in Manhattan last
year and 12 percent in 2018, according to Cushman & Wakefield. But
co-working companies are in distress and some may not survive.

Other potential renters of offices are unsure what to do or are waiting
for landlords to reduce rents, factoring in incentives like rent-free
months and cash for office improvements. “What’s the point of signing a
lease with a 15 percent decrease in rent if you think it’s going to go
lower?” said Michael Colacino, the president of the brokerage firm
SquareFoot.

Some companies with leases that are ending this year or next appear to
be kicking the can down the road, signing short-term extensions rather
than committing to typical deals that last several years. In recent
weeks, NBC Universal extended a lease for a secondary office at 1221
Avenue of Americas and the Stroock & Stroock & Lavan law firm did the
same for its office downtown. But they both did so for just a year,
according to Colliers. A spokeswoman for NBC Universal declined to
comment and Stroock & Stroock did not return a call and multiple emails.

In normal times, owners of large office buildings would typically not
entertain a one- or two-year lease extension for a large tenant, said
Franklin Wallach, senior managing director of the New York Research
Group at Colliers. “They see that new leasing activity has dropped off
while the amount of sublet space coming into the market is on the rise,
so the average landlord wants to keep the tenant in the building.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

One of the biggest concerns is that companies could soon start trying to
sublease hundreds of thousands of square feet of space that they are not
planning to use anytime soon. For companies seeking offices, sublets
often provide a shorter lease at a steep discount to market prices.

Starr Insurance Companies, which is led by Maurice R. Greenberg, is
seeking to sublet 190,000 square feet that it leases at 399 Park Avenue,
according to Colliers. And First Republic Bank, which signed a
211,521-square-foot lease last April for 410 Tenth Avenue, put 151,000
square feet up for sublet, according to a
[report](https://pdf.euro.savills.co.uk/usa/market-reports/research-mim-ny-q2-2020-final.pdf)
from the real estate broker Savills. Spokesmen for Starr and First
Republic declined to comment.

Sublet space made up about a quarter of the total office space available
in New York at the end of the second quarter, according to Savills, and
many real estate brokers said they expected that to increase in the
coming months.

In January, Ms. Colp-Haber was showing offices to a construction company
that she said was in the market for a five-year lease in Manhattan. Last
month, the company signed a sublet for one year at a 40 percent discount
to the original lease, she said.

Still, property owners claim not to be overly worried because most
tenants are paying their rent. They point out that office leases last
for years and are very difficult to end early. And large financial
firms, among the biggest tenants in New York, aren’t stressed as they
were in the last
recession.

The most optimistic sign that New York’s office market will bounce back
quickly is that big technology companies, which [are gaining
ground](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/technology/big-tech-business-domination.html),
are scarfing up square feet. Facebook in early August leased all of the

Retail tenants in Hudson Yards, the sprawling development on the Far
West Side of Manhattan, may be reeling, but companies are still moving
in to the project’s office buildings.

“They still believe New York is the place to have their business and
grow their business,” said William C. Rudin, chief executive of Rudin
Management Company. “The Amazon commitment is amazing; the Facebook
commitment is amazing.”

Some landlords see encouraging signs in their office buildings in the
suburbs, where social distancing is easier because people tend to
commute by cars. This, they argue, suggests that employers and workers
