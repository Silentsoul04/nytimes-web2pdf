Wildfires}\label{the-climate-connection-to-californias-wildfires}}

As fires spread through California during a global pandemic, read some
of our past coverage about what's causing them and what might help
contain them.

What do California's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/us/wildfires-live-updates.html}{wildfires}
have to do with climate change? The connections are very strong,
scientists who have studied the issue say.

While California's climate has always made the state
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/climate/wildfires-climate-policy.html}{prone
to fires}, the
\href{https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001210}{link
between human-caused climate change and bigger fires} is inextricable,
said Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University's
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ``This climate-change connection is
straightforward: Warmer temperatures dry out fuels. In areas with
abundant and very dry fuels, all you need is a spark,'' he said.

Here is a selection of our coverage of the connection between climate
change and California's

Insurers, facing huge losses, have been pulling back from fire-prone
areas across California. ``The marketplace has largely collapsed,'' an
advocate for counties in the state said.

Fires in California in 2019 burned nearly 260,000 acres and researchers
say record breaking years are likely to continue**.** As global
temperatures rise, understanding fire is becoming ever more important.

Hundreds of thousands of some of the country's poorest, most neglected
workers continue to pluck, weed, and pack produce for the nation as
temperatures soar into the triple digits for days at a time and the air
turns to a soup of dust and smoke.

Recent research suggests that as the climate warms, Santa Ana winds may
become less frequent. Coupled with precipitation changes, that could
mean more intense fires later in the year.

It's become clear that an expected impact of climate change in
California is increasing year-to-year variability in temperature and
precipitation that will create greater contrast between drought years
and wet years. And that can lead to much greater fire risk.

Early releases of prisoners to protect them from the coronavirus have
depleted the ranks of an inmate firefighting program that some say
should be abolished anyway.

less than \$2 an hour, the female inmate firefighters of California work
their bodies to the breaking point. Sometimes they even risk their
lives.

An increasing number of Americans are moving into the zones known as the
``wildland-urban interface,'' where nature and development collide. Some
move to live closer to nature, others to avoid government regulations or
find a lower cost of living. There are also Indigenous communities and
people who work the land. But the result can be disastrous.

Preparing the landscape to make future fires more manageable involves
clearing fire breaks and building with more fire-resistant materials in
areas of high risk. Support is also building for another method, which
involves prescribed burns. It reverses the U.S. policy of suppressing
fires, which has been in place for more than 100 years, and which has
allowed dry fuel to accumulate. And no,
