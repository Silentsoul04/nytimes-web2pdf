It is the first South Bronx setup of the Rockwell Group's DineOut NYC
systems installed across the city.

\subsubsection{Bronx Community
Foundation}\label{bronx-community-foundation}}

Last week, a group of volunteers helped assemble an outdoor dining area
on Alexander Avenue in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx.
The setup accommodates Ceetay and Hudson Smokehouse, two restaurants on
the block, and is one of the Rockwell Group's DineOut NYC systems,
installed across the city. This one is the first for the South Bronx.
Desmon and Derrick Lewis, twins who started the Bronx Community
Foundation to support local causes, including small businesses like
restaurants, are running this Alexander Avenue project, which benefits
restaurants hit hard by virus-related closings, along with Michael Brady
from the Third Avenue Business Improvement District. That organization
and the city's Department of Transportation assisted. ``With Covid, this
is what's needed now,'' Desmon said. The street will be closed to
traffic on Saturdays and Sundays. Amir Chayon, who owns Ceetay, a
pan-Asian restaurant, said: ``It will allow us to expand. We only had
three outdoor tables before.'' Hudson Smokehouse, which has a classic
barbecue menu and meats by the pound, is one of few barbecue places in
the borough. It has a couple of picnic tables out front, but the new
setup gives it additional seating. Other restaurants on the Alexander
Avenue block included in the project are Monte's Brick Oven, Beatstro
and the Lit. Bar.

Bronx, 718-618-7020, \href{http://ceetay.com/}{ceetay.com}.; Hudson

\subsubsection{The Rooftop at The NoMad
}\label{the-rooftop-at-the-nomad-}}

The NoMad hotel has a new restaurant upstairs. With its elegant turret,
the hotel's rooftop, previously used only for private parties, is now
open to the public for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Open rain or shine,
it's tented, carpeted, well upholstered and dripping with chandeliers.
The chefs, Abram Bissell and Michael Reilly, offer food that's simple
and elegant, like a \$78-per-person dinner featuring roast chicken with
foie gras and truffle stuffing as the centerpiece. The rest of the à la
carte menu includes seasonal fare like scallop crudo with charred corn
and chiles; basil gnocchi with truffles, zucchini and feta; and roast
lamb with eggplant and coriander relish. All social distancing protocols
are observed.

1170 Broadway (28th Street), 212-796-1500,

\hypertarget{el-fish-shack-}{%
\subsubsection{El Fish Shack }\label{el-fish-shack-}}

The chef Julian Medina and his partner, Louis Skibar, who own the
Toloache restaurants, have broadened their interests. Their latest, a
shack that sells fish by the pound for grilling or steaming, looks to
New England. Plates of taquitos with lobster and Mexican-style corn on
the cob coexist with New England clam chowder, steamers and a swordfish
BLT. The new spot shares the kitchen with their Tacuba Cantina Mexicana
in Astoria, Queens, and can seat 70 outdoors; takeout and delivery are
available. The menu also nods to the neighborhood with a Greek salad and
tzatziki sauce. (Opens Thursday)

35-01 36th Street (35th Avenue), Astoria, Queens, 718-786-2728.

\hypertarget{kissaki-}{%
\subsubsection{Kissaki }\label{kissaki-}}

This sushi restaurant with a notable omakase started with a single
location on the Bowery. Then, it expanded into Midtown Manhattan, in
part of the space occupied by the Greek restaurant Nerai, and, this
summer, it opened in Water Mill, N.Y. Now, it is adding an outpost on
the Upper West Side, in partnership with Cindy Guyer, the owner of
Guyer's, a cafe and wine bar. It will share the space, and have outdoor
seating, takeout and delivery. The company also has plans to open
locations in Manhasset, N.Y., and Greenwich, Conn. (Wednesday)

286 Columbus Avenue (73rd Street), 212-577-1151,

\subsubsection{Casa by Colonia Verde }\label{casa-by-colonia-verde-}}

Tamy Rofe and Felipe Donnelly, the owners of Colonia Verde in Fort
Greene, Brooklyn, have revised their takeout and delivery platform. It
has a new name, and now offers a far broader array of prepared foods,
ingredients, cocktails, wine and home goods on a list that goes well
beyond the menu they had early in the pandemic. Delivery is available in
all boroughs.

This chef, who worked at Eleven Madison Park and Chez Ma Tante, is now
in charge of the kitchen at Bathhouse Kitchen. The dining room, for
outdoors only at the moment, is attached to Bathhouse, a wellness
establishment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which opened last November.

\hypertarget{askchefsanything-}{%
\subsubsection{\#AskChefsAnything }\label{askchefsanything-}}

Back in April, to help charities for immigrant restaurant workers, this
fund-raising auction sold one-on-one virtual time with well-known chefs.
Now, as an outreach after the disaster in Beirut, Lebanon, about 100
chefs and food personalities have been added to support Beit el Baraka,
a nonpolitical nonprofit organization. It provides food and medical aid,
and assists in rebuilding homes and small businesses. The list of chefs
includes names like Massimo Bottura, Yves Camdeborde, Apollonia Poilâne,
Anissa Helou and Rene Redzepi, for 30-minute sessions with the auction
winners. The opening price for the auction is \$60. It is live starting
8 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday, and will end at 6 p.m. Sunday.
