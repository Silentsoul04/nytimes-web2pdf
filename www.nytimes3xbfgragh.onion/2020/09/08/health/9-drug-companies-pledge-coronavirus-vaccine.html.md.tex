Vaccines}\label{9-drug-companies-pledge-to-stand-with-science-on-coronavirus-vaccines}}

The joint statement by competitors was seen as an effort to restore
public trust as President Trump has pushed for a vaccine before the
presidential election.

Nine pharmaceutical companies issued a joint pledge on Tuesday that they
would ``stand with science'' and not put forward a vaccine until it had
been thoroughly vetted for safety and efficacy.

The companies did not rule out seeking an emergency authorization of
their vaccines, but promised that any potential coronavirus vaccine
would be decided based on ``large, high quality clinical trials'' and
that the companies would follow guidance from regulatory agencies like
the Food and Drug Administration.

``We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the
rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines
are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,'' the companies said.

President Trump has repeatedly claimed in recent weeks that a vaccine
could be available before Election Day --- Nov. 3 --- heightening fears
that his administration is politicizing the race to develop a vaccine
and potentially undermining public trust in any vaccine approved.

``We'll have the vaccine soon, maybe before a special date,'' the
president said on Monday. ``You know what date I'm talking about.''

The move was welcomed by some researchers who said that the statement
could increase public confidence in a coronavirus vaccine at a time when
skepticism was running high. ``There's absolutely a desperate need for
this vaccine,'' said Dr. Judith Feinberg, the vice chairwoman for
research in medicine at West Virginia University in Morgantown. ``I love
the fact that the nine big vaccine manufacturers today said they would
not do anything premature --- I think there's enormous pressure to do
something premature.''

Three of the companies that signed the pledge are testing their
candidate vaccines in late-stage clinical trials in the United States:
Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.

Pfizer has said repeatedly over the past week that it could apply to the
F.D.A. for emergency approval as early as October. On Tuesday, its chief
executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, predicted in an interview on the ``Today''
show on NBC that the company would have an answer about whether its
vaccine worked by the end of October, but acknowledged that did not mean
its vaccine would be available to the public by then.

Moderna and AstraZeneca have been less specific, saying only they hope
to have a vaccine by the end of the year. Last week, Moderna's chief
executive said the company was slightly slowing its enrollment in order
to include more people from groups that had been most affected by
Covid-19.

Pfizer and Moderna are each close to fully enrolling the 30,000
participants in each of their trials, with some analysts predicting they
will be finished within the next two weeks. AstraZeneca is further
behind in its U.S. trials, having begun enrollment on Aug. 31.

Federal officials have been pushing back against Mr. Trump's
enthusiastic predictions. Late last week, Moncef Slaoui, the top
scientist on Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to quickly bring a
vaccine to market, warned in an interview with National Public Radio
that the chance of successful vaccine results by October was ``very,
very low.''

And on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious
disease expert,
\href{https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-live-judy-woodruff-interviews-fauci-during-virtual-health-research-forum}{said
he believed}that researchers would know whether the Moderna and Pfizer
vaccines were effective by ``November or December.''

In a statement on Tuesday, Dr. Slaoui said the goal of Operation Warp
Speed was ``to ensure that no technical, logistic or financial hurdles
hinder vaccine development or deployment without curtailing the critical
steps required by sound science and regulatory standards.'' He added
that the pledge ``reiterates the position of Operation Warp Speed, that
this project is driven by science and that any vaccine must meet the
gold standard of the Food and Drug Administration.''

Drug companies have had to carefully navigate the political landscape. A
successful vaccine could help restore the industry's battered image and
offer an end to the pandemic. But rushing a vaccine to market that winds
up causing serious side effects --- or simply does not work --- could do
catastrophic damage to their reputations.

In the nine companies' statement on Tuesday, they did not mention Mr.
Trump, saying only that they have ``a united commitment to uphold the
integrity of the scientific process.''

The other six companies that signed the pledge were BioNTech, which is
developing the vaccine in partnership with Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline,
Johnson \& Johnson, Merck, Novavax and Sanofi.
