The company halted late-stage trials of its coronavirus vaccine because
of a serious suspected adverse reaction in a participant.

The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca halted large, late-stage global
trials of its coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday because of a serious
suspected adverse reaction in a participant, the company said. It is not
yet known whether the reaction was directly caused by the company's
vaccine or was coincidental.

The pause, which was first
\href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/}{reported
by STAT}, will allow AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company, to conduct
a safety review and investigate whether the vaccine caused the illness.
How long the hold will last is unclear.

Drug companies are racing to complete a coronavirus vaccine that could
bring an end to a pandemic that has
already\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{claimed
more than 890,000 lives globally.} AstraZeneca is a front-runner, with
late-stage clinical trials underway around the world, and has said it
hoped to have a vaccine ready before the end of the year. If the cause
of the reaction turns out to be related to the vaccine, those efforts
could be derailed.

Late-stage vaccine testing remains crucial, as large trials can turn up
rare but serious side effects that would surface only if many thousands
of people received a vaccine.

``This is the whole point of doing these Phase 2, Phase 3 trials,'' said
Dr. Phyllis Tien, an infectious disease physician at the University of
California, San Francisco. ``We need to assess safety, and we won't know
the efficacy part until much later. I think halting the trial until the
safety board can figure out whether or not this was directly related to
the vaccine is a good idea.''

President Trump has repeatedly pushed for the approval of a vaccine by
Election Day, Nov. 3. On Tuesday nine companies, including AstraZeneca,
made a joint pledge to ``stand with science'' on coronavirus vaccines,
reaffirming that they would not move forward with such products before
thoroughly vetting them for safety and efficacy.

In a statement, AstraZeneca described the trial's halt, which was
instituted voluntarily, as a ``routine action which has to happen
whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the
trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of
the trials.''

The company said that in large trials like the ones it is overseeing,
participants do sometimes become sick by chance ``but must be
independently reviewed to check this carefully.''

The company said it was ``working to expedite the review of the single
event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline,'' and
reaffirmed its commitment ``to the safety of our participants and the
highest standards of conduct in our trials.''

A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration declined to comment.

A person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that the participant who experienced the suspected
adverse reaction had been enrolled in a Phase 2/3 trial based in the
United Kingdom. The individual also said that a volunteer in the U.K.
trial had received a diagnosis of transverse myelitis, an inflammatory
syndrome that affects the spinal cord and is often sparked by viral
infections. However, the timing of this diagnosis, and whether it was
directly linked to AstraZeneca's vaccine, is still unknown.

Transverse myelitis can result from a number of causes that set off the
body's inflammatory responses, including viral infections, said Dr.
Gabriella Garcia, a neurologist at Yale New Haven Hospital. But, she
added, the condition is often treatable with steroids.

AstraZeneca declined to comment on the location of the participant and
did not confirm the diagnosis of transverse myelitis. ``The event is
being investigated by an independent committee, and it is too early to
conclude the specific diagnosis,'' the company said.

Some said the company's halt was evidence that the process was working
as it should.

``At this stage, we don't know if the events that triggered the hold are
related to vaccination,'' said Dr. Luciana Borio, who oversaw public
health preparedness for the National Security Council under Mr. Trump
and who was acting chief scientist at the F.D.A. under President Barack
Obama. ``But it is important for them to be thoroughly investigated.''

AstraZeneca's vaccine uses a viral vector that ferries coronavirus genes
into human cells. The viral vector in this case is a modified chimpanzee
adenovirus, altered to render it harmless to people. The coronavirus
components of the vaccine are intended to spark a protective immune
response that would be roused again should the actual coronavirus try to
infect a vaccinated individual.

In a paper published in The Lancet in July, researchers behind
AstraZeneca's formulation reported that the majority of participants in
the vaccine's Phase 1/2 trials, which are designed to assess the
product's safety, had experienced some
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31604-4/fulltext\#\%20}{mild
or moderate side effects}, including muscle aches and chills. None of
the reactions, however, were considered severe or life-threatening, and
resolved quickly. The vaccine was deemed safe enough to proceed to
further testing.

AstraZeneca's vaccine is in Phase 2/3 trials in England and India, and
in Phase 3 trials in Brazil, South Africa and more than 60 sites in the
United States. The company intended for its U.S. enrollment to
\href{https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/phase-3-clinical-testing-us-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-begins}{reach
30,000}, and started its American trials on Aug. 31.

Phase 3 trials evaluate whether vaccine candidates protect people from
infection or severe disease compared to a placebo.

Among F.D.A.-approved vaccines, serious side effects are
\href{https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/safety/side_effects}{extremely
rare}. If identified in late-stage trials, these events can
\href{https://www.fda.gov/media/102332/download}{factor strongly} in the
agency's decision whether to greenlight a product.

AstraZeneca is one of three companies whose vaccines are in late-stage
clinical trials in the United States. One of those companies, Moderna,
said on Tuesday that the pause by AstraZeneca had not affected its own
trial.
