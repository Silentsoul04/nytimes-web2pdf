``You need a theme,'' says Warachal E. Faison, board president of the
Ebony Society of Philatelic Events and Reflections, a group dedicated to
the collection of stamps relating to the African diaspora. It's fine to
start acquiring whatever stamps strike your fancy, but to be a serious
philatelist requires a more focused approach and the research required
to understand stamps in a historical context. Faison's themes include
Black history, women and health care and science (she works as a senior
medical director at Pfizer). Among her collection's highlights: an
illustrated Swedish stamp of Toni Morrison, released after her 1993
Nobel Prize in Literature, and a sheet of 10-cent stamps featuring
Booker T. Washington, the first African-American person put on a U.S.
stamp, in 1940. Faison's older brother, Walter, who serves on the board
with her, collects Martin Luther King Jr. stamps from around the world.

``Find the stamp shows in your area,'' Faison says. If you're looking
for something very specific, like, say, a 1936 Susan B. Anthony stamp,
contact the show's exhibitors in advance to see if they have it. Find a
mentor, someone who can help you navigate shows and clubs and get basic
equipment. ``Some people put their stamps in cigar boxes or shoe
boxes,'' says Faison, who recommends using stamp albums for better
preservation. Minimize how much you touch stamps, because the oil in
your skin can cause deterioration. Use tweezers or tongs instead. At
shows, protect your stamps in a cardboard envelope and stay away from
amateurs. ``You'll see people walking around drinking soda,'' Faison
says. ``That's a quick way of knowing that person is not a
philatelist.''

When the Ebony Society of Philatelic Events and Reflections hosts a
booth at a show, Faison likes to bring along duplicate stamps from her
collection so she can give them away to young people. ``When you go to
stamp shows, you see a lot of older Caucasian men,'' she says. She wants
to help inspire a new, more diverse generation of collectors who care
deeply about mail, the U.S. Postal Service and the little images on
stamps that tell stories about history. ``I don't want philatelists to
be a dying breed,'' Faison says.
