# First Pandemic, Now Ransomware: Attack Forces Hartford to Postpone School

Officials were not sure when the Connecticut city’s 18,000 public school

All summer long, educators and officials in Hartford, Conn., readied the
city’s schools to reopen in the midst of a pandemic. They rearranged
classrooms, adjusted schedules and distributed electronic devices as
they prepared to welcome some students back to buildings that had been
dormant for months.

But on Tuesday, the scheduled first day of the school year, the district
found itself paralyzed by a virus entirely different than the one they
had been expecting: a ransomware attack that forced Hartford to postpone
opening its public schools.

Like many districts across the country, the city had adopted a hybrid
model for reopening, in which some students would return to school
buildings while others would remain in a virtual setting.

After city employees spent Tuesday restoring systems that were
compromised in the attack, Hartford’s public schools were expected to
open on Wednesday, the superintendent, Leslie Torres-Rodriguez, said.

Though Hartford officials were still investigating the attack and
assessing its impact, they did not believe that any personal or
financial information had been stolen, Mayor Luke Bronin said at a news
conference.

But the cyberattack left the 18,000 students enrolled in Hartford’s
school district, one of Connecticut’s largest, in limbo at a time of
nationwide uncertainty over pandemic-era education.

“We had a very unusual summer with everything we had to do to get ready
to go back,” John Fergus, a spokesman for Hartford schools, said. “So
this is not something I thought we’d be dealing with on the first day.”

Ransomware attacks, in which hackers shut down entire computer networks
and demand payments to restore access, have been a [growing problem for
municipalities and
businesses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/09/technology/ransomware-attacks.html?module=inline)
across the United States in recent years.

After a number of locales in Connecticut fell victim to the crime last
year — including the school district in Wolcott, Conn., which was [hit
twice in four
months](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/connecticut/articles/2019-09-10/ransomware-attack-hits-school-district-twice-in-4-months)

protections.

Hartford, where the school district shares technology resources with the
city government, spent about $500,000 upgrading its security system last
year, Mr. Bronin said on Tuesday. He added he believed that investment
helped the city successfully respond to this attack.

Hartford officials first learned of the ransomware attack on Saturday,
when they discovered that more than 200 of the city’s servers, including
some used by the school system, the police department and 911
dispatchers, had been compromised.

Mr. Bronin said that while Hartford, the state’s capital and its fourth
most-populous city, had been the target of hacking attempts in the past,
the ransomware attack was “the most extensive and significant” of recent
years.

The city was able to quickly shut down servers and freeze its technology
systems, Mr. Bronin said. The city’s police, fire and 911 systems
continued to run smoothly, and the authorities did not believe any
sensitive data had been stolen. Hartford did not have to pay a ransom to
regain access to its servers.

But over the weekend, many of the servers and technology systems needed
to be restored and rebooted, a process that took a considerable amount
of time and was still ongoing as of Tuesday morning, Mr. Bronin said.

Among the impacted systems were the school district’s student
information system, which has personal data, academic records and
schedules, and a transportation system that provides real-time
information about school bus routes.

Dr. Torres-Rodriguez, the Hartford schools superintendent, said that the
student information system had been fully restored by midnight on
Tuesday, after a seven-hour rebooting process. But at around 4:30 a.m.,
the transportation system had not yet been fully repaired.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Though most of Hartford’s students had opted for remote education, a
significant number were still expected to attend in-person classes on
Tuesday. Concerned that those students would not have safe
transportation, the superintendent decided to cancel school, she said.

“If we know that we have nearly 4,000 students that are expecting to
come to school, relying on bus transportation, than we have to make sure
that we make that available,’’ Dr. Torres-Rodriguez said.

In addition to restoring the school district’s information systems, city
employees were also going “school to school, desktop to desktop” to make
sure that teachers’ equipment was not affected and could be safely used
for in-person and remote instruction, Mr. Bronin, the mayor, said.

Mr. Bronin also said officials were not sure who was behind the attack
or whether it was intended to target the first day of school. The
Hartford police chief, Jason Thody, said officers were investigating and
had sought assistance from the F.B.I.

School districts across the United States have increasingly been
targeted by hacks and cyberattacks. Last week, the public school system
in Miami-Dade County, Fla., was hit with multiple [cyberattacks on the
first day of
school.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/miami-dade-school-cyberattack.html?module=inline)
A 16-year-old student was later arrested and charged in connection with
them.
