## What Happened to Daniel Prude?

### Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Michael Simon Johnson and Lynsea Garrison, and edited by Lisa Tobin

#### The police released few details in March about the death of a Black man restrained by officers in Rochester, N.Y. The full story has prompted claims of an official cover-up.

Tuesday, September 8th, 2020

</div>

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: For months, the public was unaware of Daniel Prude’s death
    while in police custody, despite body camera video capturing it,
    raising questions about a possible cover-up. My colleague, Sarah
    Nir, reports from Rochester.
    
    It’s Tuesday, September 8.
    
    Sarah, just to start, what have you learned about Daniel Prude in
    the time since this video of his arrest was released last week?

  - sarah nir  
    The day after this really horrifying video was released, I flew up
    to Rochester to learn more about the incident and about the person.

  - joe prude  
    Oh, man, he’s a straight up comedian. No, I swear to god. If y’all
    could have met my brother, y’all would be in here laughing and
    smacking the table like y’all stole something.

sarah nir

I ended up meeting with Joe Prude, Daniel Prude’s brother. And he told
me that Daniel actually isn’t from Rochester. He’s from Chicago.

  - tameshay prude  
    Him and his brother used to argue all the time.

  - joe prude  
    Putting each other in headlock.

sarah nir

Daniel had been living, for many years, where he was born and raised in
Chicago with his sister Tameshay. And he started acting strange.

  - sarah nir  
    Did she explain what he was doing?

  - joe prude  
    Well, like, you know, just talking, like, just talking. You know? I
    mean, it was, like, \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - sarah nir  
    But she was disturbed by — worried for him, by how he was speaking?

  - joe prude  
    Yeah.

  - sarah nir  
    Yeah.

  - joe prude  
    Because my brother ain’t never talked like that.

sarah nir

His sister called his brother Joe and said, you know, I’m going to send
him up to you. And maybe you, as his big brother, can talk some sense
into him. So she puts Daniel on a train from Chicago to Rochester. And
he wasn’t right.

  - joe prude  
    Talking about, um, the devil was coming to get me and all this and
    that.

sarah nir

He was saying people were out to get him.

  - joe prude  
    And it was, like, that moment then, when I started hearing that more
    frequently, I say, oh, man. Yeah. It’s scaring me. I’ve got to get
    him — I’ve got to get my brother some help now. And I told my wife,
    I said now grab me the phone. And she asked me what I’m about to do.
    I said, I need to get my brother some help. And he started to scare
    me.

sarah nir

So he called an ambulance and asked for his brother to be admitted
because he was having a mental health crisis. But —

  - joe prude  
    They just sent him right back home in three hours.

sarah nir

— just three hours later, after arriving at Strong Memorial Hospital, he
was sent home in a medical taxi. And his brother was shocked.

  - joe prude  
    No diagnosis, no nothing.

sarah nir

He felt that Daniel should be there under evaluation. But the doctor
said no. He’s free to go.

  - sarah nir  
    What did he look like when he came back?

  - joe prude  
    Oh, like the picture you seen us holding? Same person.
    
    Same visual. Same — he was upbeat when he came in. He gave me a hug.
    Brother, I thank you for doing that for me.

  - sarah nir  
    Really? He wasn’t resentful? He wasn’t mad?

  - joe prude  
    No. No, whatsoever.

sarah nir

Then the two of them sat down at the kitchen table at Joe’s home on
Child Street in Rochester —

  - joe prude  
    Talking, like two brothers that talk.

sarah nir

And Daniel asked for a cigarette. Joe said he stood up, walked to his
room to fetch a cigarette, and when he turned around, Daniel had
streaked out the door barefoot into the freezing March weather. And
that’s when Joe called the police.

  - \[beeping\]

  - speaker  
    Hey, what’s up? Good, how are you?

michael barbaro

And what happens next?

sarah nir

So at about 3:00 a.m. on March 23, a police officer arrives at Joe’s
house on Child Street, taking a report. What’s happened? Who are we
looking for?

  - police officer  
    Does he live here?

  - joe prude  
    No. He’s just here visiting me.

  - police officer  
    Where does he live?

sarah nir

And one of the things that is really powerful when you know what
transpired here is that Joe is super concerned for Daniel’s safety.

  - joe prude  
    I just know, man, I just know when he took off running, it was a
    goddamn train coming.

  - police officer  
    Which way did he go?

  - joe prude  
    I don’t know which way he ran to be honest with you. I don’t know if
    he went that way or this way.

  - police officer  
    So you saw him run out this front door here?

  - joe prude  
    No, he ran out my back.

  - police officer  
    Ran out the back door?

  - joe prude  
    He ran out the back.

sarah nir

There’s a train nearby and train tracks. And he’s very worried his
brother is going to accidentally hurt himself.

  - police officer  
    You don’t know where he went?

  - joe prude  
    No.

  - police officer  
    He didn’t say anything?

  - joe prude  
    Nope. And the only thing I’m praying is that he don’t get in front
    of that damn train.

  - police officer  
    Yeah. But he didn’t say anything —

sarah nir

So at some point, when the officer’s in Joe’s house with him taking a
report, they hear over the radio —

  - officer on radio  
    There’s a male at that location with blood all over him, telling
    people he’s sick and not wearing clothes.

sarah nir

There’s a male at that location with blood all over him, telling people
he’s sick and he’s not wearing clothes. And Joe immediately knows —

  - joe prude  
    That’s my brother.

sarah nir

— that’s my brother.

  - police officer  
    213, where’s that at? That may be this male.

  - joe prude  
    My brother.

  - officer on radio  
    It’s at Jefferson Ave. and West Main Street. And he’s saying he’s a
    40-year-old Black male with no shirt and blue pants on.

  - police officer  
    40? Is your brother 40?

\[radio conversation\]

sarah nir

Later that same morning, an officer returns to Joe’s house and tells
him, your brother’s in the hospital.

  - police officer  
    Um, but the bosses just want me to hang out here with you until they
    figure some more, some more stuff out.

  - tameshay prude  
    \[LAUGHING\]

  - police officer  
    Did you call immediately he ran out?

  - joe prude  
    Hell, yeah.

  - tameshay prude  
    He used to run track. He can run.

  - police officer  
    Oh, obviously, I mean, he’s all the way down on Jefferson Avenue. So
    —

  - joe prude  
    Yeah, I know.

  - tameshay prude  
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - joe prude  
    I’m glad he went that way and not the way of that damn train.

  - police officer  
    Yeah. Absolutely.

sarah nir

And bear in mind, Joe has no idea why he’s in the hospital. It was
freezing cold out. It’s late March. He thinks maybe hypothermia, maybe
something bad happened while he was having this episode running around.
He doesn’t know what put him there.

  - police officer  
    I have no idea.

  - joe prude  
    He was butt naked?

  - police officer  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - tameshay prude  
    He was butt naked?

  - joe prude  
    That boy had to strip out there. All right, I can’t do that.

  - tameshay prude  
    We don’t know what to do with him.

  - joe prude  
    I can’t do that.

  - tameshay prude  
    And neither does your captain?

  - police officer  
    Well, my sergeant sent me over here just to hang out with you guys.

sarah nir

New York State had just gone on lockdown because of the pandemic about a
week before. And he can’t visit him at the hospital. He can’t go see his
brother. No visitors are allowed. We’re at the height of the
coronavirus.

  - police officer  
    No. I’m going to go — I’m going to go make a phone call real quick.
    And then I might be back up with you guys. Just to see —

sarah nir

And it takes him till March 30, when he gets a call from the hospital,
you can come in. And when he arrives at the hospital, he realizes that
he can come in because it’s time to decide whether or not to take his
brother off of life support.

michael barbaro

And what does Joe do after that?

sarah nir

Well, in the meantime, this week of being unable to know what happened
to Daniel, Joe had contacted a lawyer he knew and said, something’s
fishy. My brother ran out the door and never came back. And I need you
to help me.

So on April 3, the lawyers filed what’s called a preservation letter to
the city of Rochester, requesting all records be saved regarding Daniel
Prude. And they file another request, a Freedom of Information Law
request, saying turn over the body cameras from the police officers who
apprehended him. And they don’t hear anything back. And they chalk it up
to coronavirus. And things are closed. And life is very difficult. But
while the family was sitting there in the dark about what had happened
to him, other people knew something had gone down and were looking into
it. And one of those people was the state attorney general, Letitia
James. On April 21, her office launched an investigation. And there was
another investigation going on, an internal one by the Rochester Police
Department. They were reviewing the body camera footage that, bear in
mind, the Prudes had still never seen. And they concluded in late April
that, quote, “Based upon the investigation, the officers’ actions and
conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and
consistent with their training.”

michael barbaro

So Rochester Police cleared their own officers.

sarah nir

Yeah. But then on May 18, Joe Prude gets something startling in the
mail. It’s the medical examiner’s report on how his brother died.

michael barbaro

And what does that say? It says, at the top of it, Daniel T. Prude,
manner of death: homicide. And under cause of death, it says
complications of asphyxia. And Joe, his brother, told me he didn’t what
that word meant. And he quickly looked it up on his phone. And it means
suffocation. Suffocation here on the report in the setting of physical
restraint.

So the case remains under wraps, even going into May. And it continues
to stay locked down through June, through July, until July 31, when the
attorney general invites the Prude family to her office to view the body
camera footage from the police. And it shows what really happened to
Daniel Prude. And what does the family see on that video?

  - archived recording 1  
    \[BEEPING\]

  - archived recording 2  
    What’s his name?

  - archived recording  
    Are you Daniel?

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Yes, sir.

sarah nir

So there’s several separate videos from different officers’ body
cameras.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Please\! Jesus Christ, I pray.

sarah nir

There’s snow lightly falling. An officer points his taser at Daniel,
who’s sitting on his knees on the ground totally naked.

  - archived recording  
    Hey\! Get on the ground.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - archived recording  
    Get on the ground. Get on the ground. Get on the ground, man.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Look\!

  - archived recording  
    Get on the ground. Put your hands behind your back, behind your
    back. Don’t move. Don’t move. Chill out, man. Don’t move, all right,
    man?

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Yes, sir.

  - archived recording  
    Just don’t move.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Yes, sir.

sarah nir

Daniel initially complies, does what the officer says, lets him place
him in handcuffs. The officer actually says, well, that was easy and
fast.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - archived recording  
    One male in custody.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - archived recording  
    Can you reach in here and grab my hand sanitizer? Right here.

sarah nir

And it soon spirals and becomes very complicated.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    I can’t help it because my brother is the same.

sarah nir

And Daniel starts spitting on the ground. He had told at least one
passerby, according to 911 reports, that he had coronavirus.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Jesus Christ I pray, amen. Thank you, Lord.

  - archived recording  
    He’s telling the tow truck driver he had coronavirus.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\]

  - archived recording  
    \[INAUDIBLE\] Yeah.

sarah nir

And remember, this is the height of the pandemic. So officers put him in
what’s called a spit hood. It’s a mesh hood. And they put it over his
head. And it sets Daniel off.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[SPITTING\]

  - archived recording  
    Stop spitting, man.

sarah nir

He starts asking for the officers’ guns. And he’s continuing to spit
while wearing this hood.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Give me your gun ID.

sarah nir

At one point, the officers say, you’re going to stay down. And they
press Daniel into the ground. Actually, one of the officers kind of
makes a triangle with his hands and puts his full body weight onto
Daniel’s skull, pressing him down.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

And they hold him against the pavement. One places their knee on his
back, even as the hood remains on his head. And —

  - archived recording 1  
    I don’t know. It’s freezing out here. He’s been out naked for 30
    minutes.

  - archived recording 2  
    He feels pretty cold.

  - archived recording 3  
    You want me to take his temperature?

^archived recording 4

Yeah.

  - archived recording 5  
    He says he has corona.

  - archived recording 6  
    Huh.

  - archived recording 7  
    But he also —

  - archived recording  
    I don’t know. I couldn’t tell you anything.

sarah nir

At one point, Daniel vomits.

  - archived recording 1  
    He’s puking? Oh, he’s puking, just straight water. Did you see all
    that water came out of his mouth?

  - archived recording 2  
    I didn’t see it. But I see it now.

sarah nir

And there’s almost some joking between the officers about his condition.

  - archived recording 1  
    It’s all water. My man, you puking? Oh, look at this \[EXPLETIVE\] —

  - archived recording 2  
    \[INTERPOSING VOICES\]

  - archived recording 3  
    I saw the ambulance coming —

sarah nir

But quickly it becomes clear that Daniel is no longer moving and he
might not be breathing.

  - archived recording 1  
    Anything?

  - archived recording 2  
    He started throwing up. Now it looks like he doesn’t even have chest
    compressions.

sarah nir

And they begin to administer C.P.R.

  - archived recording  
    We need you.

  - archived recording (paramedic)  
    Coming\! Bring those medical bags down \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - archived recording 1  
    Ready?

  - archived recording 2  
    Yep.

  - archived recording 3  
    1, 2, 3.

  - archived recording 4  
    He started expelling, like, all the clear liquid. Like, he was
    throwing up.

  - archived recording (paramedic)  
    So P.C.P. can cause what we call excited delirium.

  - archived recording  
    Yeah. I know what excited delirium is.

  - archived recording (paramedic)  
    That’s — I guarantee you that’s why he coded.

  - archived recording  
    Hm.

  - archived recording (paramedic)  
    It’s not your guys’ fault. I mean, you gotta keep —

  - archived recording  
    Yeah.

  - archived recording (paramedic)  
    — keep yourselves safe. But that’s why I’m trying to get —

  - archived recording  
    I’m just going to throw him in my door.

  - archived recording (paramedic)  
    Trying to get —

sarah nir

The final video from the body cameras is Daniel Prude in the hospital.

  - archived recording 1  
    \[BACKGROUND CHATTER IN THE HOSPITAL\]

  - archived recording 2  
    Supposedly he was released from psych earlier is what I was getting
    —

  - archived recording 3  
    Here?

  - archived recording 4  
    From here, yep.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Sarah, what does the family do once they have seen this video footage?

sarah nir

Bear in mind, Michael, that Daniel has been gone since March 30. And all
this time, they didn’t know what had happened to him. Sitting in the
attorney general’s office, watching that body camera footage, is the
first time they see what really went down. Joe Sr., his father,
according to their lawyer, hyperventilated. He had an asthma attack. And
he had to use an inhaler. A few weeks later, the family decides to go
wide. And they release those videos to the public.

  - joe prude  
    I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not for my brother
    to get lynched. Now when I say he got lynched, that was a
    full-fledged ongoing murder, cold-blooded, none other than
    cold-blooded murder. Who can we hold accountable for this? Why was
    it a cover-up? Why did my brother get harmed when he complied with
    everything that them people wanted him to do? Why did he get treated
    like an African-American male from 1960? If that’s the case, you
    should have just set the damn dog on him. How many more brothers got
    to die for society to understand that this needs to stop? And I
    can’t even share with you all the pain that I’m feeling and my
    family’s going through as well. These things that’s going on right
    now —

michael barbaro

What is the reaction once these videos become public?

sarah nir

So Rochester erupts in what now has become a familiar scene of protests
against police brutality of Black people. At the same time, the mayor
announces that the seven officers who were involved in Daniel’s arrest
have been suspended from the force. But if there was any hope that that
would quell the protests, it did not. \[PROTEST CROWD SINGING\] I
watched as about 200 people gathered in front of the church on Jefferson
Avenue where Daniel Prude was pressed to the ground. It was a
passionate, yet largely peaceful crowd. They ended up in front of police
headquarters in Rochester, where they sat against barricades calling for
more reforms, chanting at police.

    (CHANTING) No justice, no peace\! \[EXPLETIVE\] these racist ass
    police.

sarah nir

Why are you in riot gear? We don’t see a riot here.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

And it quieted down. And someone brought boxes and boxes of pizza. And
as I stood there with them, while they were sitting on the ground eating
pizza and chanting, suddenly those officers in riot gear rushed the
crowd, unprovoked, and shot pepper spray all over them.

  - speaker  
    Like, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I would have thought
    they did something last night. They did not.

sarah nir

That set off an escalation. Protesters pulled up barricades. Ran at
police with them. Police fired more noxious fumes at them.

  - speaker  
    Murderer\! Murderer\!

sarah nir

And I watched as what had begun as a peaceful night emerged as something
much more fraught.

michael barbaro

And Sarah, I have to imagine that part of the reaction here is based on
just how long it has taken for the public to learn about what’s
happened, right? I mean, a video is released four months after Daniel
Prude’s death and after months and months of protests and counter
protests across the country about events just like this.

sarah nir

That’s another thing that’s fueling a lot of the anger surrounding this.
There have been accusations of a cover up. And just about everyone
involved says, no, that’s not the case, blaming other parties for the
reason why they didn’t come forward. The mayor, for example, her name is
Lovely Warren, said that —

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    After our police department responded to the 911 call on March 23, I
    was informed later that day by Chief Singletary that Mr. Prude had
    an apparent drug overdose while in custody.

sarah nir

She had been told by the police that there was a death in custody. But
Daniel Prude had died of a drug overdose.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    Chief Singletary never informed me of the actions of his officers to
    forcibly restrain Mr. Prude. I only learned of those officer’s
    actions on August 4 when Corporation Counsel Tim Curtin reviewed the
    video while fulfilling the FOI request from Mr. Prude’s attorney. At
    no time prior to August 4 did Chief Singletary or anyone make me
    aware or show me a video of the actions of the RPD officers involved
    in Mr. Prude’s death.

sarah nir

Mayor Warren said that on June 4, about three months after Daniel died,
but a week after George Floyd was killed, actually, the Attorney
General’s office asked the city not to release the camera footage.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

The pretext was to not interfere with the attorney general’s
investigation, which was ongoing. But the A.G.‘s office says this never
happened. That this is just how long an investigation takes. And that,
to them, explains the delay. The police chief came out the other day and
said, when we said this was an overdose, we were not covering up what we
did here.

But the question is, why did it take so long for this to become public?
Would we have found out about George Floyd if not for the footage? Would
we have found out about Jacob Blake if not for the footage? Often
municipalities don’t disclose this. And it’s up to us to figure out why.
What happened with Daniel Prude is his family took it into their own
hands to take his story public. And now it’s our job to understand what
took so long.

michael barbaro

You know, Sarah, I’m mindful that in the early weeks following George
Floyd’s death at the hands of police, much of the conversation was about
the precise role that police do play and should play, and the question
of whether police are being asked to do too much. And this is at the
heart of the conversation around defunding the police. This idea that,
for example, police are not trained as mental health responders. They
don’t instinctively de-escalate.

And the timing of what happened to Daniel Prude feels important here.
Because it’s easy to imagine that if what had happened to him had been
known to the public back when it really happened, that Daniel Prude
would have been a potentially very important data point in that
conversation. But months have passed. And now much of the conversation
surrounding these deaths in the hands of police have become about the
protests and the counterprotests and how they fit into the presidential
election.

And in the days since this video of Daniel Prude has been released to
the public, we aren’t really having the conversation you might expect us
to be having around mental health and how the police respond when
there’s a 911 call.

sarah nir

Actually, that is the conversation that has just started happening in
Rochester.

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    Good afternoon.

sarah nir

On Sunday, Mayor Warren announced —

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    It is my solemn duty as the mayor of this city to honor Mr. Prude,
    to not let his death be in vain, and to do everything possible to
    transform how we police our city to truly protect and serve our
    residents. We are doubling the availability of mental health
    professionals. At this —

sarah nir

She’ll be removing the family crisis intervention team from the police
department, where it’s been for a long time into the Department of Youth
and Recreation Services.

  - archived recording (police chief)  
    And I understand that there are certain calls that law enforcement
    shouldn’t handle alone. And we are looking at ways to reimagine
    policing surrounding mental health and have been for the last
    several months.

sarah nir

Really, Rochester is taking steps to maybe say that police aren’t the
people who should be responding to every call all the time. And maybe
there are other ways to handle different crises. But nationally, you’re
right, Michael. The conversation has been about protests, about who does
this get elected, and not about police reform.

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    What truly matters is creating a city that is dedicated to serving,
    protecting and lifting up the least among us. What will always pain
    me about the death of Mr. Daniel Prude is our failure to do that. We
    had a human being in need of help, in need of compassion. In that
    moment, we had an opportunity to protect him, to keep him warm, to
    bring him to safety, to begin the process of healing him and lifting
    him up. We have to own the fact that in that moment, we did not do
    that.

michael barbaro

Sarah, I’m curious what Joe Prude now says about his decision to call
the police that night. Because in his mind, the police would protect his
brother from harm.

sarah nir

I don’t think that Joe gets a moment of rest from exactly that question.
What would have happened if I hadn’t called the police?

  - sarah nir  
    I know a million people —

  - joe prude  
    I would just basically tell them that, you know me, I regret calling
    them people because \[INAUDIBLE\] it’s my fault.

  - tameshay prude  
    Yeah. Yeah, he does.

  - joe prude  
    I’ve been beating myself up about that ever since that shit
    happened.

  - tameshay prude  
    He says that all the time. Making that call is what killed him.

  - joe prude  
    That call really fucked me up. \[STREET NOISE\]

  - sarah nir  
    Well, it’s like, the police are — we’re taught you can call for
    help, right? That’s who you call.

  - joe prude  
    They proved me wrong. Proved me goddamn wrong. \[SIGHS\]

  - sarah nir  
    I don’t think a million people telling you it’s not your fault will
    help you.

  - joe prude  
    Nah, it won’t. I know it’s not. But that phone call was my fault.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

Thank you, Sarah.

sarah nir

Thank you.

michael barbaro

Over the weekend, New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced
that she would impanel a grand jury to examine evidence in the death of
Daniel Prude, a move that was immediately applauded by Prude’s family.

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (jacob blake)  
    Recording?

  - archived recording  
    Yeah.

  - archived recording (jacob blake)  
    just want to say my — to all the young cats out there and even the
    older ones, older than me, it’s a lot more life to live out here,
    man.

michael barbaro

Jacob Blake, who survived after being shot seven times by police in
Kenosha, Wisconsin, broke his silence over the weekend in a video from
his hospital bed.

  - archived recording (jacob blake)  
    Your life, and not only just your life — your legs, something that
    you need to move around and move forward in life can be taken from
    you like this, man.

michael barbaro

Blake described debilitating injuries from the shooting, which he said
required staples across his stomach and back.

  - archived recording (jacob blake)  
    This pain is nothing but pain. It hurts to breathe. It hurts to
    sleep. It hurts to move from side to side. It hurts to eat.

And India has overtaken Brazil as the country with the second largest
outbreak of the coronavirus, as infections inside the country skyrocket.
On Monday alone, India reported nearly 91,000 new infections, taking its
total to more than 4.2 million. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael
Barbaro. See you
tomorrow.

  - michael barbaro  
    From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

  - \[music\]  
    Today: For months, the public was unaware of Daniel Prude’s death
    while in police custody, despite body camera video capturing it,
    raising questions about a possible cover-up. My colleague, Sarah
    Nir, reports from Rochester.
    
    It’s Tuesday, September 8.
    
    Sarah, just to start, what have you learned about Daniel Prude in
    the time since this video of his arrest was released last week?

  - sarah nir  
    The day after this really horrifying video was released, I flew up
    to Rochester to learn more about the incident and about the person.

  - joe prude  
    Oh, man, he’s a straight up comedian. No, I swear to god. If y’all
    could have met my brother, y’all would be in here laughing and
    smacking the table like y’all stole something.

sarah nir

I ended up meeting with Joe Prude, Daniel Prude’s brother. And he told
me that Daniel actually isn’t from Rochester. He’s from Chicago.

  - tameshay prude  
    Him and his brother used to argue all the time.

  - joe prude  
    Putting each other in headlock.

sarah nir

Daniel had been living, for many years, where he was born and raised in
Chicago with his sister Tameshay. And he started acting strange.

  - sarah nir  
    Did she explain what he was doing?

  - joe prude  
    Well, like, you know, just talking, like, just talking. You know? I
    mean, it was, like, \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - sarah nir  
    But she was disturbed by — worried for him, by how he was speaking?

  - joe prude  
    Yeah.

  - sarah nir  
    Yeah.

  - joe prude  
    Because my brother ain’t never talked like that.

sarah nir

His sister called his brother Joe and said, you know, I’m going to send
him up to you. And maybe you, as his big brother, can talk some sense
into him. So she puts Daniel on a train from Chicago to Rochester. And
he wasn’t right.

  - joe prude  
    Talking about, um, the devil was coming to get me and all this and
    that.

sarah nir

He was saying people were out to get him.

  - joe prude  
    And it was, like, that moment then, when I started hearing that more
    frequently, I say, oh, man. Yeah. It’s scaring me. I’ve got to get
    him — I’ve got to get my brother some help now. And I told my wife,
    I said now grab me the phone. And she asked me what I’m about to do.
    I said, I need to get my brother some help. And he started to scare
    me.

sarah nir

So he called an ambulance and asked for his brother to be admitted
because he was having a mental health crisis. But —

  - joe prude  
    They just sent him right back home in three hours.

sarah nir

— just three hours later, after arriving at Strong Memorial Hospital, he
was sent home in a medical taxi. And his brother was shocked.

  - joe prude  
    No diagnosis, no nothing.

sarah nir

He felt that Daniel should be there under evaluation. But the doctor
said no. He’s free to go.

  - sarah nir  
    What did he look like when he came back?

  - joe prude  
    Oh, like the picture you seen us holding? Same person.
    
    Same visual. Same — he was upbeat when he came in. He gave me a hug.
    Brother, I thank you for doing that for me.

  - sarah nir  
    Really? He wasn’t resentful? He wasn’t mad?

  - joe prude  
    No. No, whatsoever.

sarah nir

Then the two of them sat down at the kitchen table at Joe’s home on
Child Street in Rochester —

  - joe prude  
    Talking, like two brothers that talk.

sarah nir

And Daniel asked for a cigarette. Joe said he stood up, walked to his
room to fetch a cigarette, and when he turned around, Daniel had
streaked out the door barefoot into the freezing March weather. And
that’s when Joe called the police.

  - \[beeping\]

  - speaker  
    Hey, what’s up? Good, how are you?

michael barbaro

And what happens next?

sarah nir

So at about 3:00 a.m. on March 23, a police officer arrives at Joe’s
house on Child Street, taking a report. What’s happened? Who are we
looking for?

  - police officer  
    Does he live here?

  - joe prude  
    No. He’s just here visiting me.

  - police officer  
    Where does he live?

sarah nir

And one of the things that is really powerful when you know what
transpired here is that Joe is super concerned for Daniel’s safety.

  - joe prude  
    I just know, man, I just know when he took off running, it was a
    goddamn train coming.

  - police officer  
    Which way did he go?

  - joe prude  
    I don’t know which way he ran to be honest with you. I don’t know if
    he went that way or this way.

  - police officer  
    So you saw him run out this front door here?

  - joe prude  
    No, he ran out my back.

  - police officer  
    Ran out the back door?

  - joe prude  
    He ran out the back.

sarah nir

There’s a train nearby and train tracks. And he’s very worried his
brother is going to accidentally hurt himself.

  - police officer  
    You don’t know where he went?

  - joe prude  
    No.

  - police officer  
    He didn’t say anything?

  - joe prude  
    Nope. And the only thing I’m praying is that he don’t get in front
    of that damn train.

  - police officer  
    Yeah. But he didn’t say anything —

sarah nir

So at some point, when the officer’s in Joe’s house with him taking a
report, they hear over the radio —

  - officer on radio  
    There’s a male at that location with blood all over him, telling
    people he’s sick and not wearing clothes.

sarah nir

There’s a male at that location with blood all over him, telling people
he’s sick and he’s not wearing clothes. And Joe immediately knows —

  - joe prude  
    That’s my brother.

sarah nir

— that’s my brother.

  - police officer  
    213, where’s that at? That may be this male.

  - joe prude  
    My brother.

  - officer on radio  
    It’s at Jefferson Ave. and West Main Street. And he’s saying he’s a
    40-year-old Black male with no shirt and blue pants on.

  - police officer  
    40? Is your brother 40?

\[radio conversation\]

sarah nir

Later that same morning, an officer returns to Joe’s house and tells
him, your brother’s in the hospital.

  - police officer  
    Um, but the bosses just want me to hang out here with you until they
    figure some more, some more stuff out.

  - tameshay prude  
    \[LAUGHING\]

  - police officer  
    Did you call immediately he ran out?

  - joe prude  
    Hell, yeah.

  - tameshay prude  
    He used to run track. He can run.

  - police officer  
    Oh, obviously, I mean, he’s all the way down on Jefferson Avenue. So
    —

  - joe prude  
    Yeah, I know.

  - tameshay prude  
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - joe prude  
    I’m glad he went that way and not the way of that damn train.

  - police officer  
    Yeah. Absolutely.

sarah nir

And bear in mind, Joe has no idea why he’s in the hospital. It was
freezing cold out. It’s late March. He thinks maybe hypothermia, maybe
something bad happened while he was having this episode running around.
He doesn’t know what put him there.

  - police officer  
    I have no idea.

  - joe prude  
    He was butt naked?

  - police officer  
    Yeah. Yeah.

  - tameshay prude  
    He was butt naked?

  - joe prude  
    That boy had to strip out there. All right, I can’t do that.

  - tameshay prude  
    We don’t know what to do with him.

  - joe prude  
    I can’t do that.

  - tameshay prude  
    And neither does your captain?

  - police officer  
    Well, my sergeant sent me over here just to hang out with you guys.

sarah nir

New York State had just gone on lockdown because of the pandemic about a
week before. And he can’t visit him at the hospital. He can’t go see his
brother. No visitors are allowed. We’re at the height of the
coronavirus.

  - police officer  
    No. I’m going to go — I’m going to go make a phone call real quick.
    And then I might be back up with you guys. Just to see —

sarah nir

And it takes him till March 30, when he gets a call from the hospital,
you can come in. And when he arrives at the hospital, he realizes that
he can come in because it’s time to decide whether or not to take his
brother off of life support.

michael barbaro

And what does Joe do after that?

sarah nir

Well, in the meantime, this week of being unable to know what happened
to Daniel, Joe had contacted a lawyer he knew and said, something’s
fishy. My brother ran out the door and never came back. And I need you
to help me.

So on April 3, the lawyers filed what’s called a preservation letter to
the city of Rochester, requesting all records be saved regarding Daniel
Prude. And they file another request, a Freedom of Information Law
request, saying turn over the body cameras from the police officers who
apprehended him. And they don’t hear anything back. And they chalk it up
to coronavirus. And things are closed. And life is very difficult. But
while the family was sitting there in the dark about what had happened
to him, other people knew something had gone down and were looking into
it. And one of those people was the state attorney general, Letitia
James. On April 21, her office launched an investigation. And there was
another investigation going on, an internal one by the Rochester Police
Department. They were reviewing the body camera footage that, bear in
mind, the Prudes had still never seen. And they concluded in late April
that, quote, “Based upon the investigation, the officers’ actions and
conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and
consistent with their training.”

michael barbaro

So Rochester Police cleared their own officers.

sarah nir

Yeah. But then on May 18, Joe Prude gets something startling in the
mail. It’s the medical examiner’s report on how his brother died.

michael barbaro

And what does that say? It says, at the top of it, Daniel T. Prude,
manner of death: homicide. And under cause of death, it says
complications of asphyxia. And Joe, his brother, told me he didn’t what
that word meant. And he quickly looked it up on his phone. And it means
suffocation. Suffocation here on the report in the setting of physical
restraint.

So the case remains under wraps, even going into May. And it continues
to stay locked down through June, through July, until July 31, when the
attorney general invites the Prude family to her office to view the body
camera footage from the police. And it shows what really happened to
Daniel Prude. And what does the family see on that video?

  - archived recording 1  
    \[BEEPING\]

  - archived recording 2  
    What’s his name?

  - archived recording  
    Are you Daniel?

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Yes, sir.

sarah nir

So there’s several separate videos from different officers’ body
cameras.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Please\! Jesus Christ, I pray.

sarah nir

There’s snow lightly falling. An officer points his taser at Daniel,
who’s sitting on his knees on the ground totally naked.

  - archived recording  
    Hey\! Get on the ground.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - archived recording  
    Get on the ground. Get on the ground. Get on the ground, man.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Look\!

  - archived recording  
    Get on the ground. Put your hands behind your back, behind your
    back. Don’t move. Don’t move. Chill out, man. Don’t move, all right,
    man?

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Yes, sir.

  - archived recording  
    Just don’t move.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Yes, sir.

sarah nir

Daniel initially complies, does what the officer says, lets him place
him in handcuffs. The officer actually says, well, that was easy and
fast.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - archived recording  
    One male in custody.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\].

  - archived recording  
    Can you reach in here and grab my hand sanitizer? Right here.

sarah nir

And it soon spirals and becomes very complicated.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    I can’t help it because my brother is the same.

sarah nir

And Daniel starts spitting on the ground. He had told at least one
passerby, according to 911 reports, that he had coronavirus.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Jesus Christ I pray, amen. Thank you, Lord.

  - archived recording  
    He’s telling the tow truck driver he had coronavirus.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\]

  - archived recording  
    \[INAUDIBLE\] Yeah.

sarah nir

And remember, this is the height of the pandemic. So officers put him in
what’s called a spit hood. It’s a mesh hood. And they put it over his
head. And it sets Daniel off.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    \[SPITTING\]

  - archived recording  
    Stop spitting, man.

sarah nir

He starts asking for the officers’ guns. And he’s continuing to spit
while wearing this hood.

  - archived recording (daniel prude)  
    Give me your gun ID.

sarah nir

At one point, the officers say, you’re going to stay down. And they
press Daniel into the ground. Actually, one of the officers kind of
makes a triangle with his hands and puts his full body weight onto
Daniel’s skull, pressing him down.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

And they hold him against the pavement. One places their knee on his
back, even as the hood remains on his head. And —

  - archived recording 1  
    I don’t know. It’s freezing out here. He’s been out naked for 30
    minutes.

    He feels pretty cold.

  - archived recording 3  
    You want me to take his temperature?

^archived recording 4

Yeah.

  - archived recording 5  
    He says he has corona.

  - archived recording 6  
    Huh.

  - archived recording 7  
    But he also —

  - archived recording  
    I don’t know. I couldn’t tell you anything.

sarah nir

At one point, Daniel vomits.

  - archived recording 1  
    He’s puking? Oh, he’s puking, just straight water. Did you see all
    that water came out of his mouth?

  - archived recording 2  
    I didn’t see it. But I see it now.

sarah nir

And there’s almost some joking between the officers about his condition.

  - archived recording 1  
    It’s all water. My man, you puking? Oh, look at this \[EXPLETIVE\] —

  - archived recording 2  
    \[INTERPOSING VOICES\]

  - archived recording 3  
    I saw the ambulance coming —

sarah nir

But quickly it becomes clear that Daniel is no longer moving and he
might not be breathing.

  - archived recording 1  
    Anything?

  - archived recording 2  
    He started throwing up. Now it looks like he doesn’t even have chest
    compressions.

sarah nir

And they begin to administer C.P.R.

    We need you.

  - archived recording (paramedic)

    Yep.

    He started expelling, like, all the clear liquid. Like, he was
    throwing up.

  - archived recording (paramedic)  
    So P.C.P. can cause what we call excited delirium.

  - archived recording  
    Yeah. I know what excited delirium is.

    That’s — I guarantee you that’s why he coded.

    Hm.

    It’s not your guys’ fault. I mean, you gotta keep —

    Yeah.

    I’m just going to throw him in my door.

    Trying to get —

The final video from the body cameras is Daniel Prude in the hospital.

    \[BACKGROUND CHATTER IN THE HOSPITAL\]

    Supposedly he was released from psych earlier is what I was getting
    —

    Here?

  - archived recording 4  
    From here, yep.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Sarah, what does the family do once they have seen this video footage?

sarah nir

Bear in mind, Michael, that Daniel has been gone since March 30. And all
this time, they didn’t know what had happened to him. Sitting in the
attorney general’s office, watching that body camera footage, is the
first time they see what really went down. Joe Sr., his father,
according to their lawyer, hyperventilated. He had an asthma attack. And
he had to use an inhaler. A few weeks later, the family decides to go
wide. And they release those videos to the public.

  - joe prude  
    I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not for my brother
    to get lynched. Now when I say he got lynched, that was a
    full-fledged ongoing murder, cold-blooded, none other than
    cold-blooded murder. Who can we hold accountable for this? Why was
    it a cover-up? Why did my brother get harmed when he complied with
    everything that them people wanted him to do? Why did he get treated
    like an African-American male from 1960? If that’s the case, you
    should have just set the damn dog on him. How many more brothers got
    to die for society to understand that this needs to stop? And I
    can’t even share with you all the pain that I’m feeling and my
    family’s going through as well. These things that’s going on right
    now —

michael barbaro

What is the reaction once these videos become public?

sarah nir

So Rochester erupts in what now has become a familiar scene of protests
against police brutality of Black people. At the same time, the mayor
announces that the seven officers who were involved in Daniel’s arrest
have been suspended from the force. But if there was any hope that that
would quell the protests, it did not. \[PROTEST CROWD SINGING\] I
watched as about 200 people gathered in front of the church on Jefferson
Avenue where Daniel Prude was pressed to the ground. It was a
passionate, yet largely peaceful crowd. They ended up in front of police
headquarters in Rochester, where they sat against barricades calling for
more reforms, chanting at police.

  - crowd  
    (CHANTING) No justice, no peace\! \[EXPLETIVE\] these racist ass
    police.

sarah nir

Why are you in riot gear? We don’t see a riot here.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

And it quieted down. And someone brought boxes and boxes of pizza. And
as I stood there with them, while they were sitting on the ground eating
pizza and chanting, suddenly those officers in riot gear rushed the
crowd, unprovoked, and shot pepper spray all over them.

  - speaker  
    Like, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I would have thought
    they did something last night. They did not.

sarah nir

That set off an escalation. Protesters pulled up barricades. Ran at
police with them. Police fired more noxious fumes at them.

  - speaker  
    Murderer\! Murderer\!

sarah nir

And I watched as what had begun as a peaceful night emerged as something
much more fraught.

michael barbaro

And Sarah, I have to imagine that part of the reaction here is based on
just how long it has taken for the public to learn about what’s
happened, right? I mean, a video is released four months after Daniel
Prude’s death and after months and months of protests and counter
protests across the country about events just like this.

sarah nir

That’s another thing that’s fueling a lot of the anger surrounding this.
There have been accusations of a cover up. And just about everyone
involved says, no, that’s not the case, blaming other parties for the
reason why they didn’t come forward. The mayor, for example, her name is
Lovely Warren, said that —

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    After our police department responded to the 911 call on March 23, I
    was informed later that day by Chief Singletary that Mr. Prude had
    an apparent drug overdose while in custody.

sarah nir

She had been told by the police that there was a death in custody. But
Daniel Prude had died of a drug overdose.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    Chief Singletary never informed me of the actions of his officers to
    forcibly restrain Mr. Prude. I only learned of those officer’s
    actions on August 4 when Corporation Counsel Tim Curtin reviewed the
    video while fulfilling the FOI request from Mr. Prude’s attorney. At
    no time prior to August 4 did Chief Singletary or anyone make me
    aware or show me a video of the actions of the RPD officers involved
    in Mr. Prude’s death.

sarah nir

Mayor Warren said that on June 4, about three months after Daniel died,
but a week after George Floyd was killed, actually, the Attorney
General’s office asked the city not to release the camera footage.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

The pretext was to not interfere with the attorney general’s
investigation, which was ongoing. But the A.G.‘s office says this never
happened. That this is just how long an investigation takes. And that,
to them, explains the delay. The police chief came out the other day and
said, when we said this was an overdose, we were not covering up what we
did here.

But the question is, why did it take so long for this to become public?
Would we have found out about George Floyd if not for the footage? Would
we have found out about Jacob Blake if not for the footage? Often
municipalities don’t disclose this. And it’s up to us to figure out why.
What happened with Daniel Prude is his family took it into their own
hands to take his story public. And now it’s our job to understand what
took so long.

michael barbaro

You know, Sarah, I’m mindful that in the early weeks following George
Floyd’s death at the hands of police, much of the conversation was about
the precise role that police do play and should play, and the question
of whether police are being asked to do too much. And this is at the
heart of the conversation around defunding the police. This idea that,
for example, police are not trained as mental health responders. They
don’t instinctively de-escalate.

And the timing of what happened to Daniel Prude feels important here.
Because it’s easy to imagine that if what had happened to him had been
known to the public back when it really happened, that Daniel Prude
would have been a potentially very important data point in that
conversation. But months have passed. And now much of the conversation
surrounding these deaths in the hands of police have become about the
protests and the counterprotests and how they fit into the presidential
election.

And in the days since this video of Daniel Prude has been released to
the public, we aren’t really having the conversation you might expect us
to be having around mental health and how the police respond when
there’s a 911 call.

sarah nir

Actually, that is the conversation that has just started happening in
Rochester.

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    Good afternoon.

sarah nir

On Sunday, Mayor Warren announced —

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    It is my solemn duty as the mayor of this city to honor Mr. Prude,
    to not let his death be in vain, and to do everything possible to
    transform how we police our city to truly protect and serve our
    residents. We are doubling the availability of mental health
    professionals. At this —

sarah nir

She’ll be removing the family crisis intervention team from the police
department, where it’s been for a long time into the Department of Youth
and Recreation Services.

  - archived recording (police chief)  
    And I understand that there are certain calls that law enforcement
    shouldn’t handle alone. And we are looking at ways to reimagine
    policing surrounding mental health and have been for the last
    several months.

sarah nir

Really, Rochester is taking steps to maybe say that police aren’t the
people who should be responding to every call all the time. And maybe
there are other ways to handle different crises. But nationally, you’re
right, Michael. The conversation has been about protests, about who does
this get elected, and not about police reform.

  - archived recording (lovely warren)  
    What truly matters is creating a city that is dedicated to serving,
    protecting and lifting up the least among us. What will always pain
    me about the death of Mr. Daniel Prude is our failure to do that. We
    had a human being in need of help, in need of compassion. In that
    moment, we had an opportunity to protect him, to keep him warm, to
    bring him to safety, to begin the process of healing him and lifting
    him up. We have to own the fact that in that moment, we did not do
    that.

michael barbaro

Sarah, I’m curious what Joe Prude now says about his decision to call
the police that night. Because in his mind, the police would protect his
brother from harm.

sarah nir

I don’t think that Joe gets a moment of rest from exactly that question.
What would have happened if I hadn’t called the police?

  - sarah nir  
    I know a million people —

  - joe prude  
    I would just basically tell them that, you know me, I regret calling
    them people because \[INAUDIBLE\] it’s my fault.

  - tameshay prude  
    Yeah. Yeah, he does.

  - joe prude  
    I’ve been beating myself up about that ever since that shit
    happened.

  - tameshay prude  
    He says that all the time. Making that call is what killed him.

  - joe prude  
    That call really fucked me up. \[STREET NOISE\]

  - sarah nir  
    Well, it’s like, the police are — we’re taught you can call for
    help, right? That’s who you call.

  - joe prude  
    They proved me wrong. Proved me goddamn wrong. \[SIGHS\]

  - sarah nir  
    I don’t think a million people telling you it’s not your fault will
    help you.

  - joe prude  
    Nah, it won’t. I know it’s not. But that phone call was my fault.

\[music\]

michael barbaro

Thank you, Sarah.

sarah nir

Thank you.

michael barbaro

Over the weekend, New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced
that she would impanel a grand jury to examine evidence in the death of
Daniel Prude, a move that was immediately applauded by Prude’s family.

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today.

  - archived recording (jacob blake)  
    Recording?

  - archived recording  
    Yeah.

  - archived recording (jacob blake)  
    just want to say my — to all the young cats out there and even the
    older ones, older than me, it’s a lot more life to live out here,
    man.

michael barbaro

Jacob Blake, who survived after being shot seven times by police in
Kenosha, Wisconsin, broke his silence over the weekend in a video from
his hospital bed.

  - archived recording (jacob blake)  
    Your life, and not only just your life — your legs, something that
    you need to move around and move forward in life can be taken from
    you like this, man.

michael barbaro

Blake described debilitating injuries from the shooting, which he said
required staples across his stomach and back.

  - archived recording (jacob blake)  
    This pain is nothing but pain. It hurts to breathe. It hurts to
    sleep. It hurts to move from side to side. It hurts to eat.

michael barbaro

And India has overtaken Brazil as the country with the second largest
outbreak of the coronavirus, as infections inside the country skyrocket.
On Monday alone, India reported nearly 91,000 new infections, taking its
total to more than 4.2 million. That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael
Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

*This episode contains strong language.*

In March, Daniel Prude was exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis.
His brother called an ambulance in the hopes that Mr. Prude would be
hospitalized, but he was sent back home after three hours without a
diagnosis.

Later, when Mr. Prude ran out of the house barely clothed into the
Rochester night, his brother, Joe Prude, again called on the authorities
for help, but this time it was to the police.

After a struggle with officers, Daniel Prude suffered cardiac distress.
It would be days before Joe Prude was able to visit him in the hospital

life support — and months before the family would find out what had
happened when he was apprehended.

**Background reading:**

  - In the minutes after Mr. Prude’s heart briefly stopped during a
    struggle with officers, an unofficial police narrative took hold: He
    had suffered a drug overdose. But the release of body camera footage
    [complicated that version of
    events](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/nyregion/rochester-police-daniel-prude.html).

  - The Monroe County medical examiner ruled Mr. Prude’s death a
    homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of
    physical restraint.” [Seven Rochester police
    officers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/nyregion/daniel-prude-police-rochester.html)
    have now been suspended.
