\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''
\item
  {[}music{]}\\
  Today: For months, the public was unaware of Daniel Prude's death
  while in police custody, despite body camera video capturing it,
  raising questions about a possible cover-up. My colleague, Sarah Nir,
  reports from Rochester.

  It's Tuesday, September 8.

  Sarah, just to start, what have you learned about Daniel Prude in the
  time since this video of his arrest was released last week?
\item
  sarah nir\\
  The day after this really horrifying video was released, I flew up to
  Rochester to learn more about the incident and about the person.
\item
  joe prude\\
  Oh, man, he's a straight up comedian. No, I swear to god. If y'all
  could have met my brother, y'all would be in here laughing and
  smacking the table like y'all stole something.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

I ended up meeting with Joe Prude, Daniel Prude's brother. And he told
me that Daniel actually isn't from Rochester. He's from Chicago.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  Him and his brother used to argue all the time.
\item
  joe prude\\
  Putting each other in headlock.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Daniel had been living, for many years, where he was born and raised in
Chicago with his sister Tameshay. And he started acting strange.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  sarah nir\\
  Did she explain what he was doing?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Well, like, you know, just talking, like, just talking. You know? I
  mean, it was, like, {[}INAUDIBLE{]}.
\item
  sarah nir\\
  But she was disturbed by --- worried for him, by how he was speaking?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Yeah.
\item
  sarah nir\\
  Yeah.
\item
  joe prude\\
  Because my brother ain't never talked like that.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

His sister called his brother Joe and said, you know, I'm going to send
him up to you. And maybe you, as his big brother, can talk some sense
into him. So she puts Daniel on a train from Chicago to Rochester. And
he wasn't right.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  Talking about, um, the devil was coming to get me and all this and
  that.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

He was saying people were out to get him.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  And it was, like, that moment then, when I started hearing that more
  frequently, I say, oh, man. Yeah. It's scaring me. I've got to get him
  --- I've got to get my brother some help now. And I told my wife, I
  said now grab me the phone. And she asked me what I'm about to do. I
  said, I need to get my brother some help. And he started to scare me.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

So he called an ambulance and asked for his brother to be admitted
because he was having a mental health crisis. But ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  They just sent him right back home in three hours.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

--- just three hours later, after arriving at Strong Memorial Hospital,
he was sent home in a medical taxi. And his brother was shocked.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  No diagnosis, no nothing.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

He felt that Daniel should be there under evaluation. But the doctor
said no. He's free to go.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  sarah nir\\
  What did he look like when he came back?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Oh, like the picture you seen us holding? Same person.

  Same visual. Same --- he was upbeat when he came in. He gave me a hug.
  Brother, I thank you for doing that for me.
\item
  sarah nir\\
  Really? He wasn't resentful? He wasn't mad?
\item
  joe prude\\
  No. No, whatsoever.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Then the two of them sat down at the kitchen table at Joe's home on
Child Street in Rochester ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  Talking, like two brothers that talk.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And Daniel asked for a cigarette. Joe said he stood up, walked to his
room to fetch a cigarette, and when he turned around, Daniel had
streaked out the door barefoot into the freezing March weather. And
that's when Joe called the police.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {[}beeping{]}
\item
  speaker\\
  Hey, what's up? Good, how are you?
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And what happens next?

sarah nir

So at about 3:00 a.m. on March 23, a police officer arrives at Joe's
house on Child Street, taking a report. What's happened? Who are we
looking for?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  Does he live here?
\item
  joe prude\\
  No. He's just here visiting me.
\item
  police officer\\
  Where does he live?
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And one of the things that is really powerful when you know what
transpired here is that Joe is super concerned for Daniel's safety.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  joe prude\\
  I just know, man, I just know when he took off running, it was a
  goddamn train coming.
\item
  police officer\\
  Which way did he go?
\item
  joe prude\\
  I don't know which way he ran to be honest with you. I don't know if
  he went that way or this way.
\item
  police officer\\
  So you saw him run out this front door here?
\item
  joe prude\\
  No, he ran out my back.
\item
  police officer\\
  Ran out the back door?
\item
  joe prude\\
  He ran out the back.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

There's a train nearby and train tracks. And he's very worried his
brother is going to accidentally hurt himself.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  You don't know where he went?
\item
  joe prude\\
  No.
\item
  police officer\\
  He didn't say anything?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Nope. And the only thing I'm praying is that he don't get in front of
  that damn train.
\item
  police officer\\
  Yeah. But he didn't say anything ---
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

So at some point, when the officer's in Joe's house with him taking a
report, they hear over the radio ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  officer on radio\\
  There's a male at that location with blood all over him, telling
  people he's sick and not wearing clothes.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

There's a male at that location with blood all over him, telling people
he's sick and he's not wearing clothes. And Joe immediately knows ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  That's my brother.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

--- that's my brother.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  213, where's that at? That may be this male.
\item
  joe prude\\
  My brother.
\item
  officer on radio\\
  It's at Jefferson Ave. and West Main Street. And he's saying he's a
  40-year-old Black male with no shirt and blue pants on.
\item
  police officer\\
  40? Is your brother 40?
\end{itemize}

{[}radio conversation{]}

sarah nir

Later that same morning, an officer returns to Joe's house and tells
him, your brother's in the hospital.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  Um, but the bosses just want me to hang out here with you until they
  figure some more, some more stuff out.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  {[}LAUGHING{]}
\item
  police officer\\
  Did you call immediately he ran out?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Hell, yeah.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  He used to run track. He can run.
\item
  police officer\\
  Oh, obviously, I mean, he's all the way down on Jefferson Avenue. So
  ---
\item
  joe prude\\
  Yeah, I know.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]}.
\item
  joe prude\\
  I'm glad he went that way and not the way of that damn train.
\item
  police officer\\
  Yeah. Absolutely.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And bear in mind, Joe has no idea why he's in the hospital. It was
freezing cold out. It's late March. He thinks maybe hypothermia, maybe
something bad happened while he was having this episode running around.
He doesn't know what put him there.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  I have no idea.
\item
  joe prude\\
  He was butt naked?
\item
  police officer\\
  Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  He was butt naked?
\item
  joe prude\\
  That boy had to strip out there. All right, I can't do that.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  We don't know what to do with him.
\item
  joe prude\\
  I can't do that.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  And neither does your captain?
\item
  police officer\\
  Well, my sergeant sent me over here just to hang out with you guys.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

New York State had just gone on lockdown because of the pandemic about a
week before. And he can't visit him at the hospital. He can't go see his
brother. No visitors are allowed. We're at the height of the
coronavirus.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  police officer\\
  No. I'm going to go --- I'm going to go make a phone call real quick.
  And then I might be back up with you guys. Just to see ---
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And it takes him till March 30, when he gets a call from the hospital,
you can come in. And when he arrives at the hospital, he realizes that
he can come in because it's time to decide whether or not to take his
brother off of life support.

michael barbaro

And what does Joe do after that?

sarah nir

Well, in the meantime, this week of being unable to know what happened
to Daniel, Joe had contacted a lawyer he knew and said, something's
fishy. My brother ran out the door and never came back. And I need you
to help me.

So on April 3, the lawyers filed what's called a preservation letter to
the city of Rochester, requesting all records be saved regarding Daniel
Prude. And they file another request, a Freedom of Information Law
request, saying turn over the body cameras from the police officers who
apprehended him. And they don't hear anything back. And they chalk it up
to coronavirus. And things are closed. And life is very difficult. But
while the family was sitting there in the dark about what had happened
to him, other people knew something had gone down and were looking into
it. And one of those people was the state attorney general, Letitia
James. On April 21, her office launched an investigation. And there was
another investigation going on, an internal one by the Rochester Police
Department. They were reviewing the body camera footage that, bear in
mind, the Prudes had still never seen. And they concluded in late April
that, quote, ``Based upon the investigation, the officers' actions and
conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and
consistent with their training.''

michael barbaro

So Rochester Police cleared their own officers.

sarah nir

Yeah. But then on May 18, Joe Prude gets something startling in the
mail. It's the medical examiner's report on how his brother died.

michael barbaro

And what does that say? It says, at the top of it, Daniel T. Prude,
manner of death: homicide. And under cause of death, it says
complications of asphyxia. And Joe, his brother, told me he didn't what
that word meant. And he quickly looked it up on his phone. And it means
suffocation. Suffocation here on the report in the setting of physical
restraint.

So the case remains under wraps, even going into May. And it continues
to stay locked down through June, through July, until July 31, when the
attorney general invites the Prude family to her office to view the body
camera footage from the police. And it shows what really happened to
Daniel Prude. And what does the family see on that video?

\begin{itemize}

  What's his name?
\item
  archived recording\\
  Are you Daniel?
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Yes, sir.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

So there's several separate videos from different officers' body
cameras.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Please! Jesus Christ, I pray.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

There's snow lightly falling. An officer points his taser at Daniel,
who's sitting on his knees on the ground totally naked.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording\\
  Hey! Get on the ground.
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]}.
\item

  Get on the ground. Get on the ground. Get on the ground, man.
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Look!
\item
  archived recording\\
  Get on the ground. Put your hands behind your back, behind your back.
  Don't move. Don't move. Chill out, man. Don't move, all right, man?
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Yes, sir.
\item
  archived recording\\
  Just don't move.
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Yes, sir.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Daniel initially complies, does what the officer says, lets him place
him in handcuffs. The officer actually says, well, that was easy and
fast.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]}.
\item

  {[}INAUDIBLE{]}.
\item
  archived recording\\
  Can you reach in here and grab my hand sanitizer? Right here.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And it soon spirals and becomes very complicated.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  I can't help it because my brother is the same.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And Daniel starts spitting on the ground. He had told at least one
passerby, according to 911 reports, that he had coronavirus.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Jesus Christ I pray, amen. Thank you, Lord.
\item
  archived recording\\
  He's telling the tow truck driver he had coronavirus.
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]}
\item
  archived recording\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]} Yeah.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And remember, this is the height of the pandemic. So officers put him in
what's called a spit hood. It's a mesh hood. And they put it over his
head. And it sets Daniel off.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  {[}SPITTING{]}
\item
  archived recording\\
  Stop spitting, man.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

He starts asking for the officers' guns. And he's continuing to spit
while wearing this hood.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Give me your gun ID.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

At one point, the officers say, you're going to stay down. And they
press Daniel into the ground. Actually, one of the officers kind of
makes a triangle with his hands and puts his full body weight onto
Daniel's skull, pressing him down.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

And they hold him against the pavement. One places their knee on his
back, even as the hood remains on his head. And ---

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  I don't know. It's freezing out here. He's been out naked for 30
  minutes.
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  He feels pretty cold.
\item
  archived recording 3\\
  You want me to take his temperature?
\end{itemize}

\^{}archived recording 4

Yeah.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 5\\
  He says he has corona.
\item
  archived recording 6\\
  Huh.
\item
  archived recording 7\\
  But he also ---
\item
  archived recording\\
  I don't know. I couldn't tell you anything.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

At one point, Daniel vomits.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  He's puking? Oh, he's puking, just straight water. Did you see all
  that water came out of his mouth?
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  I didn't see it. But I see it now.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And there's almost some joking between the officers about his condition.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  It's all water. My man, you puking? Oh, look at this {[}EXPLETIVE{]}
  ---
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  {[}INTERPOSING VOICES{]}
\item
  archived recording 3\\
  I saw the ambulance coming ---
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

But quickly it becomes clear that Daniel is no longer moving and he
might not be breathing.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording 1\\
  Anything?
\item
  archived recording 2\\
  He started throwing up. Now it looks like he doesn't even have chest
  compressions.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And they begin to administer C.P.R.

\begin{itemize}
\item

  We need you.

  Yep.

  He started expelling, like, all the clear liquid. Like, he was
  throwing up.
\item
  archived recording (paramedic)\\
  So P.C.P. can cause what we call excited delirium.
\item

  Yeah. I know what excited delirium is.
\item

The final video from the body cameras is Daniel Prude in the hospital.

\item
  archived recording 4\\
  From here, yep.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

Sarah, what does the family do once they have seen this video footage?

sarah nir

Bear in mind, Michael, that Daniel has been gone since March 30. And all
this time, they didn't know what had happened to him. Sitting in the
attorney general's office, watching that body camera footage, is the
first time they see what really went down. Joe Sr., his father,
according to their lawyer, hyperventilated. He had an asthma attack. And
he had to use an inhaler. A few weeks later, the family decides to go
wide. And they release those videos to the public.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not for my brother
  to get lynched. Now when I say he got lynched, that was a full-fledged
  ongoing murder, cold-blooded, none other than cold-blooded murder. Who
  can we hold accountable for this? Why was it a cover-up? Why did my
  brother get harmed when he complied with everything that them people
  wanted him to do? Why did he get treated like an African-American male
  from 1960? If that's the case, you should have just set the damn dog
  on him. How many more brothers got to die for society to understand
  that this needs to stop? And I can't even share with you all the pain
  that I'm feeling and my family's going through as well. These things
  that's going on right now ---
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

What is the reaction once these videos become public?

sarah nir

So Rochester erupts in what now has become a familiar scene of protests
against police brutality of Black people. At the same time, the mayor
announces that the seven officers who were involved in Daniel's arrest
have been suspended from the force. But if there was any hope that that
would quell the protests, it did not. {[}PROTEST CROWD SINGING{]} I
watched as about 200 people gathered in front of the church on Jefferson
Avenue where Daniel Prude was pressed to the ground. It was a
passionate, yet largely peaceful crowd. They ended up in front of police
headquarters in Rochester, where they sat against barricades calling for
more reforms, chanting at police.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  crowd\\
  (CHANTING) No justice, no peace! {[}EXPLETIVE{]} these racist ass
  police.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Why are you in riot gear? We don't see a riot here.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

And it quieted down. And someone brought boxes and boxes of pizza. And
as I stood there with them, while they were sitting on the ground eating
pizza and chanting, suddenly those officers in riot gear rushed the
crowd, unprovoked, and shot pepper spray all over them.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  Like, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would have thought they
  did something last night. They did not.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

That set off an escalation. Protesters pulled up barricades. Ran at
police with them. Police fired more noxious fumes at them.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  Murderer! Murderer!
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And I watched as what had begun as a peaceful night emerged as something
much more fraught.

michael barbaro

And Sarah, I have to imagine that part of the reaction here is based on
just how long it has taken for the public to learn about what's
happened, right? I mean, a video is released four months after Daniel
Prude's death and after months and months of protests and counter
protests across the country about events just like this.

sarah nir

That's another thing that's fueling a lot of the anger surrounding this.
There have been accusations of a cover up. And just about everyone
involved says, no, that's not the case, blaming other parties for the
reason why they didn't come forward. The mayor, for example, her name is
Lovely Warren, said that ---

\begin{itemize}

  After our police department responded to the 911 call on March 23, I
  was informed later that day by Chief Singletary that Mr. Prude had an
  apparent drug overdose while in custody.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

She had been told by the police that there was a death in custody. But
Daniel Prude had died of a drug overdose.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (lovely warren)\\
  Chief Singletary never informed me of the actions of his officers to
  forcibly restrain Mr. Prude. I only learned of those officer's actions
  on August 4 when Corporation Counsel Tim Curtin reviewed the video
  while fulfilling the FOI request from Mr. Prude's attorney. At no time
  prior to August 4 did Chief Singletary or anyone make me aware or show
  me a video of the actions of the RPD officers involved in Mr. Prude's
  death.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Mayor Warren said that on June 4, about three months after Daniel died,
but a week after George Floyd was killed, actually, the Attorney
General's office asked the city not to release the camera footage.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

The pretext was to not interfere with the attorney general's
investigation, which was ongoing. But the A.G.`s office says this never
happened. That this is just how long an investigation takes. And that,
to them, explains the delay. The police chief came out the other day and
said, when we said this was an overdose, we were not covering up what we
did here.

But the question is, why did it take so long for this to become public?
Would we have found out about George Floyd if not for the footage? Would
we have found out about Jacob Blake if not for the footage? Often
municipalities don't disclose this. And it's up to us to figure out why.
What happened with Daniel Prude is his family took it into their own
hands to take his story public. And now it's our job to understand what
took so long.

michael barbaro

You know, Sarah, I'm mindful that in the early weeks following George
Floyd's death at the hands of police, much of the conversation was about
the precise role that police do play and should play, and the question
of whether police are being asked to do too much. And this is at the
heart of the conversation around defunding the police. This idea that,
for example, police are not trained as mental health responders. They
don't instinctively de-escalate.

And the timing of what happened to Daniel Prude feels important here.
Because it's easy to imagine that if what had happened to him had been
known to the public back when it really happened, that Daniel Prude
would have been a potentially very important data point in that
conversation. But months have passed. And now much of the conversation
surrounding these deaths in the hands of police have become about the
protests and the counterprotests and how they fit into the presidential
election.

And in the days since this video of Daniel Prude has been released to
the public, we aren't really having the conversation you might expect us
to be having around mental health and how the police respond when
there's a 911 call.

sarah nir

Actually, that is the conversation that has just started happening in
Rochester.

\begin{itemize}

  Good afternoon.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

On Sunday, Mayor Warren announced ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (lovely warren)\\
  It is my solemn duty as the mayor of this city to honor Mr. Prude, to
  not let his death be in vain, and to do everything possible to
  transform how we police our city to truly protect and serve our
  residents. We are doubling the availability of mental health
  professionals. At this ---
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

She'll be removing the family crisis intervention team from the police
department, where it's been for a long time into the Department of Youth
and Recreation Services.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (police chief)\\
  And I understand that there are certain calls that law enforcement
  shouldn't handle alone. And we are looking at ways to reimagine
  policing surrounding mental health and have been for the last several
  months.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Really, Rochester is taking steps to maybe say that police aren't the
people who should be responding to every call all the time. And maybe
there are other ways to handle different crises. But nationally, you're
right, Michael. The conversation has been about protests, about who does
this get elected, and not about police reform.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (lovely warren)\\
  What truly matters is creating a city that is dedicated to serving,
  protecting and lifting up the least among us. What will always pain me
  about the death of Mr. Daniel Prude is our failure to do that. We had
  a human being in need of help, in need of compassion. In that moment,
  we had an opportunity to protect him, to keep him warm, to bring him
  to safety, to begin the process of healing him and lifting him up. We
  have to own the fact that in that moment, we did not do that.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Sarah, I'm curious what Joe Prude now says about his decision to call
the police that night. Because in his mind, the police would protect his
brother from harm.

sarah nir

I don't think that Joe gets a moment of rest from exactly that question.
What would have happened if I hadn't called the police?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  sarah nir\\
  I know a million people ---
\item
  joe prude\\
  I would just basically tell them that, you know me, I regret calling
  them people because {[}INAUDIBLE{]} it's my fault.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  Yeah. Yeah, he does.
\item
  joe prude\\
  I've been beating myself up about that ever since that shit happened.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  He says that all the time. Making that call is what killed him.
\item
  joe prude\\
  That call really fucked me up. {[}STREET NOISE{]}
\item
  sarah nir\\
  Well, it's like, the police are --- we're taught you can call for
  help, right? That's who you call.
\item
  joe prude\\
  They proved me wrong. Proved me goddamn wrong. {[}SIGHS{]}
\item
  sarah nir\\
  I don't think a million people telling you it's not your fault will
  help you.
\item
  joe prude\\
  Nah, it won't. I know it's not. But that phone call was my fault.
\end{itemize}

Thank you, Sarah.

sarah nir

Thank you.

Over the weekend, New York's attorney general, Letitia James, announced
that she would impanel a grand jury to examine evidence in the death of
Daniel Prude, a move that was immediately applauded by Prude's family.

We'll be right back.

And India has overtaken Brazil as the country with the second largest
outbreak of the coronavirus, as infections inside the country skyrocket.
On Monday alone, India reported nearly 91,000 new infections, taking its
total to more than 4.2 million. That's it for ``The Daily.'' I'm Michael

\begin{itemize}
\item
  michael barbaro\\
  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is ``The Daily.''
\item
  {[}music{]}\\
  Today: For months, the public was unaware of Daniel Prude's death
  while in police custody, despite body camera video capturing it,
  raising questions about a possible cover-up. My colleague, Sarah Nir,
  reports from Rochester.

  It's Tuesday, September 8.

  Sarah, just to start, what have you learned about Daniel Prude in the
  time since this video of his arrest was released last week?
\item
  sarah nir\\
  The day after this really horrifying video was released, I flew up to
  Rochester to learn more about the incident and about the person.
\item
  joe prude\\
  Oh, man, he's a straight up comedian. No, I swear to god. If y'all
  could have met my brother, y'all would be in here laughing and
  smacking the table like y'all stole something.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

I ended up meeting with Joe Prude, Daniel Prude's brother. And he told
me that Daniel actually isn't from Rochester. He's from Chicago.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  Him and his brother used to argue all the time.
\item
  joe prude\\
  Putting each other in headlock.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Daniel had been living, for many years, where he was born and raised in
Chicago with his sister Tameshay. And he started acting strange.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  sarah nir\\
  Did she explain what he was doing?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Well, like, you know, just talking, like, just talking. You know? I
  mean, it was, like, {[}INAUDIBLE{]}.
\item
  sarah nir\\
  But she was disturbed by --- worried for him, by how he was speaking?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Yeah.
\item
  sarah nir\\
  Yeah.
\item
  joe prude\\
  Because my brother ain't never talked like that.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

His sister called his brother Joe and said, you know, I'm going to send
him up to you. And maybe you, as his big brother, can talk some sense
into him. So she puts Daniel on a train from Chicago to Rochester. And
he wasn't right.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  Talking about, um, the devil was coming to get me and all this and
  that.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

He was saying people were out to get him.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  And it was, like, that moment then, when I started hearing that more
  frequently, I say, oh, man. Yeah. It's scaring me. I've got to get him
  --- I've got to get my brother some help now. And I told my wife, I
  said now grab me the phone. And she asked me what I'm about to do. I
  said, I need to get my brother some help. And he started to scare me.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

So he called an ambulance and asked for his brother to be admitted
because he was having a mental health crisis. But ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  They just sent him right back home in three hours.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

--- just three hours later, after arriving at Strong Memorial Hospital,
he was sent home in a medical taxi. And his brother was shocked.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  No diagnosis, no nothing.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

He felt that Daniel should be there under evaluation. But the doctor
said no. He's free to go.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  sarah nir\\
  What did he look like when he came back?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Oh, like the picture you seen us holding? Same person.

  Same visual. Same --- he was upbeat when he came in. He gave me a hug.
  Brother, I thank you for doing that for me.
\item
  sarah nir\\
  Really? He wasn't resentful? He wasn't mad?
\item
  joe prude\\
  No. No, whatsoever.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Then the two of them sat down at the kitchen table at Joe's home on
Child Street in Rochester ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  Talking, like two brothers that talk.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And Daniel asked for a cigarette. Joe said he stood up, walked to his
room to fetch a cigarette, and when he turned around, Daniel had
streaked out the door barefoot into the freezing March weather. And
that's when Joe called the police.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  {[}beeping{]}
\item
  speaker\\
  Hey, what's up? Good, how are you?
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

And what happens next?

sarah nir

So at about 3:00 a.m. on March 23, a police officer arrives at Joe's
house on Child Street, taking a report. What's happened? Who are we
looking for?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  Does he live here?
\item
  joe prude\\
  No. He's just here visiting me.
\item
  police officer\\
  Where does he live?
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And one of the things that is really powerful when you know what
transpired here is that Joe is super concerned for Daniel's safety.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  joe prude\\
  I just know, man, I just know when he took off running, it was a
  goddamn train coming.
\item
  police officer\\
  Which way did he go?
\item
  joe prude\\
  I don't know which way he ran to be honest with you. I don't know if
  he went that way or this way.
\item
  police officer\\
  So you saw him run out this front door here?
\item
  joe prude\\
  No, he ran out my back.
\item
  police officer\\
  Ran out the back door?
\item
  joe prude\\
  He ran out the back.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

There's a train nearby and train tracks. And he's very worried his
brother is going to accidentally hurt himself.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  You don't know where he went?
\item
  joe prude\\
  No.
\item
  police officer\\
  He didn't say anything?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Nope. And the only thing I'm praying is that he don't get in front of
  that damn train.
\item
  police officer\\
  Yeah. But he didn't say anything ---
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

So at some point, when the officer's in Joe's house with him taking a
report, they hear over the radio ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  officer on radio\\
  There's a male at that location with blood all over him, telling
  people he's sick and not wearing clothes.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

There's a male at that location with blood all over him, telling people
he's sick and he's not wearing clothes. And Joe immediately knows ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  That's my brother.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

--- that's my brother.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  213, where's that at? That may be this male.
\item
  joe prude\\
  My brother.
\item
  officer on radio\\
  It's at Jefferson Ave. and West Main Street. And he's saying he's a
  40-year-old Black male with no shirt and blue pants on.
\item
  police officer\\
  40? Is your brother 40?
\end{itemize}

{[}radio conversation{]}

sarah nir

Later that same morning, an officer returns to Joe's house and tells
him, your brother's in the hospital.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  Um, but the bosses just want me to hang out here with you until they
  figure some more, some more stuff out.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  {[}LAUGHING{]}
\item
  police officer\\
  Did you call immediately he ran out?
\item
  joe prude\\
  Hell, yeah.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  He used to run track. He can run.
\item
  police officer\\
  Oh, obviously, I mean, he's all the way down on Jefferson Avenue. So
  ---
\item
  joe prude\\
  Yeah, I know.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  {[}INAUDIBLE{]}.
\item
  joe prude\\
  I'm glad he went that way and not the way of that damn train.
\item
  police officer\\
  Yeah. Absolutely.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And bear in mind, Joe has no idea why he's in the hospital. It was
freezing cold out. It's late March. He thinks maybe hypothermia, maybe
something bad happened while he was having this episode running around.
He doesn't know what put him there.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  police officer\\
  I have no idea.
\item
  joe prude\\
  He was butt naked?
\item
  police officer\\
  Yeah. Yeah.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  He was butt naked?
\item
  joe prude\\
  That boy had to strip out there. All right, I can't do that.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  We don't know what to do with him.
\item
  joe prude\\
  I can't do that.
\item
  tameshay prude\\
  And neither does your captain?
\item
  police officer\\
  Well, my sergeant sent me over here just to hang out with you guys.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

New York State had just gone on lockdown because of the pandemic about a
week before. And he can't visit him at the hospital. He can't go see his
brother. No visitors are allowed. We're at the height of the
coronavirus.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  police officer\\
  No. I'm going to go --- I'm going to go make a phone call real quick.
  And then I might be back up with you guys. Just to see ---
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And it takes him till March 30, when he gets a call from the hospital,
you can come in. And when he arrives at the hospital, he realizes that
he can come in because it's time to decide whether or not to take his
brother off of life support.

michael barbaro

And what does Joe do after that?

sarah nir

Well, in the meantime, this week of being unable to know what happened
to Daniel, Joe had contacted a lawyer he knew and said, something's
fishy. My brother ran out the door and never came back. And I need you
to help me.

So on April 3, the lawyers filed what's called a preservation letter to
the city of Rochester, requesting all records be saved regarding Daniel
Prude. And they file another request, a Freedom of Information Law
request, saying turn over the body cameras from the police officers who
apprehended him. And they don't hear anything back. And they chalk it up
to coronavirus. And things are closed. And life is very difficult. But
while the family was sitting there in the dark about what had happened
to him, other people knew something had gone down and were looking into
it. And one of those people was the state attorney general, Letitia
James. On April 21, her office launched an investigation. And there was
another investigation going on, an internal one by the Rochester Police
Department. They were reviewing the body camera footage that, bear in
mind, the Prudes had still never seen. And they concluded in late April
that, quote, ``Based upon the investigation, the officers' actions and
conduct displayed when dealing with Prude appear to be appropriate and
consistent with their training.''

michael barbaro

So Rochester Police cleared their own officers.

sarah nir

Yeah. But then on May 18, Joe Prude gets something startling in the
mail. It's the medical examiner's report on how his brother died.

michael barbaro

And what does that say? It says, at the top of it, Daniel T. Prude,
manner of death: homicide. And under cause of death, it says
complications of asphyxia. And Joe, his brother, told me he didn't what
that word meant. And he quickly looked it up on his phone. And it means
suffocation. Suffocation here on the report in the setting of physical
restraint.

So the case remains under wraps, even going into May. And it continues
to stay locked down through June, through July, until July 31, when the
attorney general invites the Prude family to her office to view the body
camera footage from the police. And it shows what really happened to
Daniel Prude. And what does the family see on that video?

So there's several separate videos from different officers' body

  Please! Jesus Christ, I pray.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

There's snow lightly falling. An officer points his taser at Daniel,
who's sitting on his knees on the ground totally naked.

  Yes, sir.
\item

  Just don't move.
\item

\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Daniel initially complies, does what the officer says, lets him place
him in handcuffs. The officer actually says, well, that was easy and
fast.

And it soon spirals and becomes very complicated.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  I can't help it because my brother is the same.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And Daniel starts spitting on the ground. He had told at least one
passerby, according to 911 reports, that he had coronavirus.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Jesus Christ I pray, amen. Thank you, Lord.

  {[}INAUDIBLE{]}
\item

  {[}INAUDIBLE{]} Yeah.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And remember, this is the height of the pandemic. So officers put him in
what's called a spit hood. It's a mesh hood. And they put it over his
head. And it sets Daniel off.

\begin{itemize}
\item

  {[}SPITTING{]}

  Stop spitting, man.

He starts asking for the officers' guns. And he's continuing to spit
while wearing this hood.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (daniel prude)\\
  Give me your gun ID.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

At one point, the officers say, you're going to stay down. And they
press Daniel into the ground. Actually, one of the officers kind of
makes a triangle with his hands and puts his full body weight onto
Daniel's skull, pressing him down.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

And they hold him against the pavement. One places their knee on his
back, even as the hood remains on his head. And ---

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

Sarah, what does the family do once they have seen this video footage?

sarah nir

Bear in mind, Michael, that Daniel has been gone since March 30. And all
this time, they didn't know what had happened to him. Sitting in the
attorney general's office, watching that body camera footage, is the
first time they see what really went down. Joe Sr., his father,
according to their lawyer, hyperventilated. He had an asthma attack. And
he had to use an inhaler. A few weeks later, the family decides to go
wide. And they release those videos to the public.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  joe prude\\
  I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not for my brother
  to get lynched. Now when I say he got lynched, that was a full-fledged
  ongoing murder, cold-blooded, none other than cold-blooded murder. Who
  can we hold accountable for this? Why was it a cover-up? Why did my
  brother get harmed when he complied with everything that them people
  wanted him to do? Why did he get treated like an African-American male
  from 1960? If that's the case, you should have just set the damn dog
  on him. How many more brothers got to die for society to understand
  that this needs to stop? And I can't even share with you all the pain
  that I'm feeling and my family's going through as well. These things
  that's going on right now ---
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

What is the reaction once these videos become public?

sarah nir

So Rochester erupts in what now has become a familiar scene of protests
against police brutality of Black people. At the same time, the mayor
announces that the seven officers who were involved in Daniel's arrest
have been suspended from the force. But if there was any hope that that
would quell the protests, it did not. {[}PROTEST CROWD SINGING{]} I
watched as about 200 people gathered in front of the church on Jefferson
Avenue where Daniel Prude was pressed to the ground. It was a
passionate, yet largely peaceful crowd. They ended up in front of police
headquarters in Rochester, where they sat against barricades calling for
more reforms, chanting at police.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  crowd\\
  (CHANTING) No justice, no peace! {[}EXPLETIVE{]} these racist ass
  police.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Why are you in riot gear? We don't see a riot here.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

And it quieted down. And someone brought boxes and boxes of pizza. And
as I stood there with them, while they were sitting on the ground eating
pizza and chanting, suddenly those officers in riot gear rushed the
crowd, unprovoked, and shot pepper spray all over them.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  Like, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would have thought they
  did something last night. They did not.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

That set off an escalation. Protesters pulled up barricades. Ran at
police with them. Police fired more noxious fumes at them.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  speaker\\
  Murderer! Murderer!
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

And I watched as what had begun as a peaceful night emerged as something
much more fraught.

michael barbaro

And Sarah, I have to imagine that part of the reaction here is based on
just how long it has taken for the public to learn about what's
happened, right? I mean, a video is released four months after Daniel
Prude's death and after months and months of protests and counter
protests across the country about events just like this.

sarah nir

That's another thing that's fueling a lot of the anger surrounding this.
There have been accusations of a cover up. And just about everyone
involved says, no, that's not the case, blaming other parties for the
reason why they didn't come forward. The mayor, for example, her name is
Lovely Warren, said that ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (lovely warren)\\
  After our police department responded to the 911 call on March 23, I
  was informed later that day by Chief Singletary that Mr. Prude had an
  apparent drug overdose while in custody.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

She had been told by the police that there was a death in custody. But
Daniel Prude had died of a drug overdose.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (lovely warren)\\
  Chief Singletary never informed me of the actions of his officers to
  forcibly restrain Mr. Prude. I only learned of those officer's actions
  on August 4 when Corporation Counsel Tim Curtin reviewed the video
  while fulfilling the FOI request from Mr. Prude's attorney. At no time
  prior to August 4 did Chief Singletary or anyone make me aware or show
  me a video of the actions of the RPD officers involved in Mr. Prude's
  death.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Mayor Warren said that on June 4, about three months after Daniel died,
but a week after George Floyd was killed, actually, the Attorney
General's office asked the city not to release the camera footage.

michael barbaro

Hm.

sarah nir

The pretext was to not interfere with the attorney general's
investigation, which was ongoing. But the A.G.`s office says this never
happened. That this is just how long an investigation takes. And that,
to them, explains the delay. The police chief came out the other day and
said, when we said this was an overdose, we were not covering up what we
did here.

But the question is, why did it take so long for this to become public?
Would we have found out about George Floyd if not for the footage? Would
we have found out about Jacob Blake if not for the footage? Often
municipalities don't disclose this. And it's up to us to figure out why.
What happened with Daniel Prude is his family took it into their own
hands to take his story public. And now it's our job to understand what
took so long.

michael barbaro

You know, Sarah, I'm mindful that in the early weeks following George
Floyd's death at the hands of police, much of the conversation was about
the precise role that police do play and should play, and the question
of whether police are being asked to do too much. And this is at the
heart of the conversation around defunding the police. This idea that,
for example, police are not trained as mental health responders. They
don't instinctively de-escalate.

And the timing of what happened to Daniel Prude feels important here.
Because it's easy to imagine that if what had happened to him had been
known to the public back when it really happened, that Daniel Prude
would have been a potentially very important data point in that
conversation. But months have passed. And now much of the conversation
surrounding these deaths in the hands of police have become about the
protests and the counterprotests and how they fit into the presidential
election.

And in the days since this video of Daniel Prude has been released to
the public, we aren't really having the conversation you might expect us
to be having around mental health and how the police respond when
there's a 911 call.

sarah nir

Actually, that is the conversation that has just started happening in
Rochester.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (lovely warren)\\
  Good afternoon.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

On Sunday, Mayor Warren announced ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (lovely warren)\\
  It is my solemn duty as the mayor of this city to honor Mr. Prude, to
  not let his death be in vain, and to do everything possible to
  transform how we police our city to truly protect and serve our
  residents. We are doubling the availability of mental health
  professionals. At this ---
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

She'll be removing the family crisis intervention team from the police
department, where it's been for a long time into the Department of Youth
and Recreation Services.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (police chief)\\
  And I understand that there are certain calls that law enforcement
  shouldn't handle alone. And we are looking at ways to reimagine
  policing surrounding mental health and have been for the last several
  months.
\end{itemize}

sarah nir

Really, Rochester is taking steps to maybe say that police aren't the
people who should be responding to every call all the time. And maybe
there are other ways to handle different crises. But nationally, you're
right, Michael. The conversation has been about protests, about who does
this get elected, and not about police reform.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (lovely warren)\\
  What truly matters is creating a city that is dedicated to serving,
  protecting and lifting up the least among us. What will always pain me
  about the death of Mr. Daniel Prude is our failure to do that. We had
  a human being in need of help, in need of compassion. In that moment,
  we had an opportunity to protect him, to keep him warm, to bring him
  to safety, to begin the process of healing him and lifting him up. We
  have to own the fact that in that moment, we did not do that.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Sarah, I'm curious what Joe Prude now says about his decision to call
the police that night. Because in his mind, the police would protect his
brother from harm.

sarah nir

I don't think that Joe gets a moment of rest from exactly that question.
What would have happened if I hadn't called the police?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  sarah nir\\
  I know a million people ---

  I would just basically tell them that, you know me, I regret calling
  them people because {[}INAUDIBLE{]} it's my fault.

\emph{This episode contains strong language.}

In March, Daniel Prude was exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis.
His brother called an ambulance in the hopes that Mr. Prude would be
hospitalized, but he was sent back home after three hours without a
diagnosis.

Later, when Mr. Prude ran out of the house barely clothed into the
Rochester night, his brother, Joe Prude, again called on the authorities
for help, but this time it was to the police.

After a struggle with officers, Daniel Prude suffered cardiac distress.
It would be days before Joe Prude was able to visit him in the hospital
--- permitted only so he could decide whether to take his brother off
life support --- and months before the family would find out what had
happened when he was apprehended.

Today, we hear from Joe Prude about that night and examine the actions
taken by the police during his brother's arrest, including the official
narrative that emerged after his death.
