# Capri, a Getaway for the Rich and Famous, Misses Its Americans

Visitors from the United States make up the largest share of foreign

local businesses.

CAPRI, Italy — On a sweltering Monday morning in August, half an hour
before a ferry to Capri was scheduled to depart from a harbor in Naples,
dozens of sweating people crowded on the dock, their face masks in
various states of ineffectiveness.

The ferry ride to Capri, an island off the coast of southern Italy,
lasts about an hour. Once on the island, many of those on board spent
the rest of the day lining up for the funicular, for buses, for taxis
and for boats.

After a strict lockdown this spring, during which most people were
barred from entering the island, Capri reopened to tourists in June**,**
a few months later than usual. Like other parts of Italy, the region
that Capri is in, Campania, has seen a [large drop in international
tourists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-tourism.html)
this summer — 85 to 90 percent less than last year, according to Gianni
Terminiello, who is in charge of statistics at Campania’s tourism
agency.

Capri made up some of the difference last month with Italian tourists;
the mayor of Capri estimated that thousands of people **** were arriving
daily in August.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The visitors carry a health risk, but Capri’s 14,000 or so residents
rely on tourism, so the stores, hotels and beach clubs have reopened,
with some operating at full or near-full capacity. On a recent weekday,
beach coves were dotted with towels and bright, colored umbrellas,
restaurants like the popular Da Paolino were booked solid (weeks in
advance), and the cafes in the “piazzetta” — the square at the center of
Capri — were filled from morning to night.

According to health authorities in Campania, the island had zero cases
of Covid-19 in June and July. Sixteen were recorded in the second half
of August.

The dreaminess of Capri’s rugged landscape and jewel-toned sea has long
attracted the wealthy, famous and powerful, beginning about 2,000 years
ago with the Roman emperor Tiberius, who built 12 villas on the island
and is said to have thrown people who displeased him off Capri’s cliffs.

Toward the end of the 19th century, Axel Munthe, the physician and
companion of Queen Victoria of Sweden, built a holiday [getaway in
Capri](http://www.villasanmichele.eu/), and several decades later, in
the early 1900s, the writer Maxim Gorky [hosted his friend Vladimir
Lenin](https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/d931478e-6c95-42a5-910b-1d960452536e/the-other-revolution-gorkij-and-lenin-on-capri/docs-for-sale)
at his Capri home. (Gorky was one of the island’s famous exiles; another
was [the poet Pablo
Neruda](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2020/music-continental-books-and-medieval-manuscripts/pablo-neruda-16-letters-together-with-documents).)

“If they wanted to stop, there was no way you could get them to go,”
Mrs. Gentile Ferragamo said of the animals. “You had to wait until they
had their lunch. But we were not in a hurry.” Now, Mrs. Gentile
Ferragamo, 77, visits her villa on the island two or three times a year
and spends most of her time on her
“[gozzo](https://www.capri.com/en/b/rent-a-gozzo-boat-on-capri),” a
traditional local boat, lounging in the sun during the day and catching
squid in the evening.

“Everything is good in Capri,” she said.

Still, the pandemic has touched the island in many ways.

In early August, Marino Lembo, the mayor of Capri, fearful of the
effects that the crush of visitors could have on the island’s zero
infections, made masks mandatory in the busiest parts of the island,
like the center square and its adjoining streets.

On a recent couple of days, tourists seemed to be following the rule —
at least during the afternoons. Their faces covered, they strolled past
display cases lined with limoncello, past Chanel and Gucci and Fendi,
and past the artisanal boutiques selling sandals and perfumes.

But at night, as the hours ticked by and the coffee cups in the
piazzetta were replaced by bottles of wine, the little cloth barriers
slipped off, revealing more and more skin.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Wearing masks doesn’t allow you to feel like you’re on vacation,” said
Mariano Della Corte, 37, a journalist and social anthropologist who grew
up in Capri and lives there now. “Capri is a place that’s exotic. You
don’t care about your problems, your everyday life. But now, you cannot
have the place as an
escape.”

Fewer people on the island has meant a resurgence of nature, with
cleaner waters and more space for the island’s fauna, but Caprese
business owners lament the lack of one particular species this year: the
Americans. Locals say that the island looks and feels very different
without the summer set that migrates across the ocean and makes up the
largest share of Capri’s foreign tourists.

“Life in Capri is connected to the presence of these people,” said Mr.
Della Corte. “It’s kind of a second home for them. We see them as a part
of the island.” Without the usual summer crowds, he said, “it seems like
another place.”

Dinner is later, for one. “The Americans eat at 7 p.m.,” said Carmine De
Martino, 39, the owner of [Bagni
Tiberio](https://www.bagnitiberio.com/en/index), a beach club opened in
1926 by Mr. De Martino’s great-grandfather among the ruins of a Roman
villa. “The Italians eat at 10 p.m.” The general volume has increased,
he added. “Americans are quieter. Now it’s a very loud place because we
are noisy.”

Mr. Lembo, the mayor, said that Americans who are used to staying in
Capri every summer in the same rooms in the same hotels have been
calling to ask if they can come this year. “Obviously it is not
possible,” he said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

Michela De Martino, 44, who with her sister and uncle owns [Da
Paolino](https://paolinocapri.com/en/), a former farm and bocce court
that became a restaurant in the 1970s, said that about 80 percent of
their customers are from the United States. Over the decades, those
customers have included Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Leonardo DiCaprio,
Will Smith and Uma Thurman.

Since travel restrictions were announced, she said, many Americans have
been writing and calling, already making plans to eat at the
lemon-tree-shaded restaurant in the summer of 2021.

## A Symbol of the ‘Dolce Vita’

Americans, particularly famous ones, have been a dependable presence in
Capri since the end of the Second World War. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
an oft-photographed visitor, made famous both a [local style of

of their relationship, when it was still somewhat of a
secret.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

[celebrated](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/09/reality-tv-star-kylie-jenner-celebrates-birthday-on-1m-a-week-superyacht)
her 22nd birthday on the waters surrounding Capri on a yacht that was
[sold for $126
million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-03/genting-to-buy-1mdb-linked-yacht-from-malaysia-for-126-million),
Jay-Z and Beyoncé [received a standing

when leaving a local restaurant, and Jennifer Lopez [hopped onto a
table](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmPSFnPA7zd/?utm_source=ig_embed) to
spontaneously perform “Let’s Get Loud” at Taverna Anema e Core, the
island’s can’t-miss nightclub.

“Capri, in the imagination, is still linked to the ‘dolce vita,’” said
Michela Giovinetti, 46, a location manager who has lived on the island
for 20 years. “Historically, Capri was a symbol of freedom and
simplicity and hedonism.”

Ms. Giovinetti, who has worked on projects like Dolce & Gabbana’s Light
Blue perfume [ad
campaigns](https://www.dolcegabbanabeauty.com/perfumes/light-blue/) and
Louis Vuitton’s arty [perfume commercial featuring Emma
Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFv5smPPuZo), is feeling the pain
of travel restrictions. Nearly all of her projects involve working with
people from abroad, especially from the United States. So far this year,
she has had only one request for her scouting services.

Americans who visit Capri have a different approach to shopping than
Europeans, Mr. Alvarez de Toledo said. He runs [Eco
Capri](https://www.ecocapri.com/), a boutique that sells scarves,
caftans, bags, plates and other decorative items printed with designs
created by his grandmother, Laetitia Cerio, an artist whose prints
featured in Emilio Pucci’s first collection.

“The Americans, if they like two or three scarves, they’re like, ‘You
know what, I’ll just take the three because I’ll figure out what to do
with them later,’” Mr. Alvarez de Toledo said. “Europeans are much more,
‘Tomorrow I’ll come back and get it down to two, and then I’ll choose
one.’ We’ve all been spoiled with that sort of
optimism.”

Mr. Alvarez de Toledo said his store, like the island, has regulars, who
vacation in Capri every year. “The Capri lovers,” he calls them. This
season, with the Capri lovers stuck across the ocean, Eco Capri has seen
a bump in online traffic, in response to which Mr. Alvarez de Toledo and
his partners created a weekly newsletter to keep up with 500 of their
customers from afar.

Other businesses offering luxury services also miss the American
visitors, and their deep pockets. Vincenzo Murolo, 40, the owner and
chief executive of [Capri On Board](https://www.caprionboard.com/), a
yacht management company, said that this year, his business has
decreased by 87 percent. Though Americans are not his only customers,
they are his top customers, spending, on average, about 3,000 euros
($3,500).

“There’s a war between boat owners to have the American tourists because
they’re the ones who spend the most money,” said Danilo Palumbo, 33, of
[Capri Boat Service](https://www.capriboatservice.com/), which offers
tours around the area, with prices starting at 80 euros ($95) for the
one-hour selfie tour to 4,000 euros ($4,750) for a half-day on a private
yacht.

Despite all the nostalgia for the Americans, some residents noted that
there are benefits to the much-reduced tourist traffic. “You can walk
everywhere on the island, even during rush hour,” Mr. Della Corte said.

Others said the difference between the tourist season this year and last
has hardly been noticeable.

Ersilia Buonocore, 63, one of the owners of a family-run [gelato and
pastry
shop](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/capri.gelateriabuonocore/) that
her father opened in the center of town nearly five decades ago, found a
couple of minutes to talk on a late afternoon. “It’s basically the
same,” she said, before rushing back to serving a long line of
customers eager for that most universal of luxuries: a cold, sweet
treat.
