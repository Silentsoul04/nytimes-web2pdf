The illegal marijuana trade remains a constant and deadly presence, the
Riverside County sheriff said.

Seven people were fatally shot early Monday morning at a rural Southern
California home that the authorities said housed a large-scale illegal
marijuana-growing operation.

More than 1,000 pounds of marijuana and ``several hundred'' marijuana
plants with a street value of up to \$5 million were found at the house
in Aguanga, an unincorporated area of Riverside County north of San
Diego, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. One
victim, a woman, was transported by paramedics to a hospital for
treatment, the office said. All seven died as a result of their
injuries, officials said.

Sheriff Chad Bianco said at a news conference on Tuesday night that the
illegal marijuana trade remains a constant and deadly menace, even as
the state has legalized recreational marijuana. ``Marijuana is not a
victimless crime,'' he said. ``These illegal operations are extremely
dangerous.''

So far this year, the sheriff's office has responded to eight episodes
in Riverside County with a total of 14 murder victims ``dealing strictly
with marijuana,'' he said.

Sheriff Bianco offered few details about the most recent killings. ``We
believe at this time that there were multiple suspects,'' he said. ``We
are still processing the scene, we are still processing our witnesses
and potential witnesses for any information that they may be able to
provide us that can lead us to the identification of suspects.''

But the sheriff spoke at length about the location as being part of a
far-reaching, ``major organized crime type operation.'' The property had
multiple spaces for growing and processing marijuana plants, housing for
as many as 20 people, and multiple vehicles registered to different
states, he said.

There were facilities to grow, dry, and process marijuana into ``honey
oil,'' he said, referring to the golden, highly potent liquid extracted
from the plant and containing the psychoactive ingredient
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.

The investigation will likely lead the authorities into multiple states,
Sheriff Bianco said, or beyond. ``All of the people who were on site
that were potential witnesses or the victims, were Laotians,'' he said.
He did not elaborate.

Medical marijuana has been legal in California for 20 years and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/09/us/politics/marijuana-legalization.html}{the
sale of recreational marijuana} was legalized in 2016. But the state's
longtime
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/27/us/marijuana-california-legalization.html}{illegal
marijuana market} has continued to thrive, officials have said. Experts
say that is because of the surplus of marijuana in the area as well as a
patchwork of laws by local governments regulating the newly legalized
industry.

Though California's large cities have established legal marijuana
businesses, most of the state --- small cities and towns --- has not.
This is one of the many reasons the illegal market continues to
flourish.

Of roughly 14 million pounds of cannabis grown in California, some 80
percent is sent out illicitly to the rest of the country, according to
state estimates, where the product can command vastly higher prices than
in California.

In 2019, \href{https://newfrontierdata.com/}{New Frontier Data}, a data
research company that specializes in cannabis, calculated that high
demand and more advanced growing techniques would contribute
approximately half a million pounds more illicit cannabis than the year
before.

Riverside County has regulated commercial cannabis operations
