He has represented the husband of one of the Real Housewives of Beverly
Hills, the licensing company behind the

rat viral video} and a slew of clients that run afoul of liberal
sensibilities --- from drug makers and arms dealers to Walmart.

Now Douglas Emhoff could potentially represent the United States as its
first Second Gentleman, as his wife, Senator Kamala Harris of
California, campaigns as the running mate of former Vice President
Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee.

While Mr. Emhoff's fund-raising prowess and connections in the legal
community in both Washington and Los Angeles were seen as strengths when
Ms. Harris was challenging Mr. Biden for the presidential nomination,
they loomed as a potential liability once Mr. Biden added her to the
ticket. Late last month, Mr. Emhoff announced that he was taking a leave
of absence from DLA Piper, one of the world's largest law firms, where
he is a partner.

It remains unclear whether Mr. Emhoff will continue to practice law in
any capacity, but keeping a connection to a firm with a thriving
Washington lobbying practice and offices in places like Moscow and
Riyadh, the Saudi capital, could prove problematic.

Working for clients who are entitled to legal representation is distinct
from the type of conflicts of interest that have proliferated in Mr.
Trump's Washington. The administration and its associates have routinely
used their positions to promote and

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/14/us/politics/Kellyanne-Conway-ivanka-trump-ethics.html}{the
Office of Government Ethics}.

Even so, if Mr. Emhoff maintains his DLA partnership or continues
practicing law elsewhere, it could complicate efforts by Mr. Biden and
Ms. Harris to distinguish themselves from the Trump Administration's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/18/climate/trump-cabinet-lobbyists.html}{practices.}

During his decade as a lawyer at the corporate firm Venable, Mr. Emhoff
represented the pharmaceutical giant Merck in lawsuits tied to its drug
Fosamax; the arms dealer Dolarian Capital in a case related to its sale
of AK-47s for use in Afghanistan; and a nightclub owner accused of
sexual harassment and sexual battery.

Mr. Emhoff

Venable} in 2017 for DLA Piper, where he has less of a track record.
Though he is not personally registered to lobby, ethics experts flagged
the firm's lobbying practice --- which in addition to defense
contractors and telecommunications companies includes countries with
checkered human rights records like
