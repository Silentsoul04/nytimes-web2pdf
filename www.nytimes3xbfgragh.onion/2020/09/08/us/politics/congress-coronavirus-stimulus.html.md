# Republicans Push Scaled-Back Stimulus Plan as Impasse on Virus Aid Persists

The economic recovery measure Republicans presented on Tuesday is a

WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Tuesday proposed a substantially
[scaled-back stimulus
plan](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/us/politics/republicans-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html)
to provide federal aid to unemployed workers, schools, farmers, the
Postal Service and small businesses, announcing a vote this week whose
primary purpose was to try to foist blame on Democrats for a continuing
stalemate.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, presented the
measure as senators returned to Washington after a summer break that saw
no progress in talks between top Democrats and White House officials on
a recovery package to address the pandemic and the recession. The
legislation — immediately rejected by Democrats as an inadequate
response to the crisis — slashes by hundreds of billions of dollars the
$1 trillion proposal Republicans had initially offered in negotiations,
and is a fraction of the $2.2 trillion Democrats have said is necessary.

But Mr. McConnell, who has struggled to navigate divisions within his
party over the scope of any additional federal aid, made it clear that
he would force action on the doomed package, if only to escalate
political pressure on Democrats to accept a much smaller plan than they
have been willing to agree to.

“I will make sure every Senate Democrat who has said they’d like to
reach an agreement gets the opportunity to walk the walk,” he said on
Tuesday.

The bill is likely to fail on a test vote planned for Thursday — it
would need 60 votes to advance — with Democrats opposed and the
potential for some Republican defections. Even before Republicans
released the bill text, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator
Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, declared that it was
“laden with poison pills Republicans know Democrats would never
support.”

The impasse amounts to a fraught political situation for both parties
less than two months before the November election, with millions still
unemployed and the pandemic continuing to spread with no promise of
relief from Congress. Since lawmakers left Washington in early August,
millions of Americans have filed new unemployment claims,
[wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
and [devastating

have ravaged the country, schools have [struggled to safely

and states have begun carrying out [a series of budget cuts to remain
solvent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/business/state-budgets-coronavirus-aid.html).

And Congress must soon confront the annual lapse in government funding
at the end of the month, though both lawmakers and administration
officials have voiced support for a stopgap bill that would keep the
government functioning through the November
election.

“I’m optimistic in the next two weeks that the pressure and the voice of
the American people will start to have an impact on members of
Congress,” Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said Tuesday
on Fox Business Network.

Moderate lawmakers in both chambers, particularly those facing difficult
re-election challenges, are growing increasingly anxious over the
gridlock and eager to persuade voters that Congress is addressing the
toll of the pandemic, a dynamic that Republicans hope will help pressure
Democrats to lower their spending demands.

While House Democrats approved a $3.4 trillion measure in May, Ms.
Pelosi in recent days has told Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary,
that Democrats would be willing to accept a package of $2.2 trillion.
(Mr. Mnuchin, for his part, [has
signaled](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/business/economy/mnuchin-coronavirus.html)
that the administration may be willing to accept up to a $1.5 trillion
package.)

It is unclear, however, if Republicans will all unite behind the
measure. Fiscal hawks are deeply reluctant to embrace more spending
after an infusion of nearly $3 trillion this spring, and the
Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that government debt had
ballooned in the 2020 fiscal year [and nearly outpaced the size of the
economy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/business/us-federal-debt.html).

The measure presented on Tuesday, crafted after weeks of daily
conference calls with senators and top administration officials, would
provide up to $700 billion, Republican aides said, although about half
of that money would come from repurposing funding already approved by
Congress in the stimulus law enacted in March.

That law provided funding for the Treasury Department to guarantee loans
made by the Federal Reserve to distressed companies, hundreds of
billions of dollars of which remains unspent.

The Republican-written legislation would provide a $300-per-week federal
unemployment benefit, the same amount that President Trump diverted from
existing disaster relief funds through executive action last month, and
provide that relief through Dec. 27. Democrats have pushed to revive the
full $600-per-week payment established in the March stimulus law, at
least through January.

The Republican plan would also include liability protections for
hospitals, businesses and schools operating during the pandemic, and
would forgive a $10 billion loan given to the Postal Service in previous
relief legislation. It would revive the lapsed Paycheck Protection
Program, a popular federal loan program for small businesses, and
provide $20 billion for farmers, $105 billion for schools, $31 billion
for the development and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine, and $16
billion for testing.

Republican leaders also agreed to include a tax credit championed by
Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, to reimburse donations to
scholarship funds that help pay for private school tuition and other
expenses. With some bipartisan objection to the provision, the tax
credit is not permanent, as Mr. Cruz had initially intended, but instead
will last for two years.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The bill does not provide funds for another round of $1,200 stimulus
checks for Americans, which both chambers had included in their opening
offers, or offer any additional funding to state and local governments.

“Senators will not ** be voting on whether this targeted package
satisfies every one of their legislative hopes and dreams,” Mr.
McConnell said. “That’s not what we do in this chamber. We vote on
whether to make laws.”

He argued that House Democrats, by holding a rare Saturday session late
last month to vote on a bill to provide additional relief to the
beleaguered Postal Service, could no longer object to considering a
narrow relief package. (That legislation is not expected to receive a
vote in the Senate.)

But Democrats on Tuesday dismissed Mr. McConnell’s challenge, with top
leaders calling the measure “emaciated” and doing little to address the
long-term impact of the pandemic on the nation’s economy. Mr. Schumer,
charging that the Republican bill is “targeted to corporate donors,” was
warned against impugning the motives of another senator on the Senate
floor.

“What they have is so meager that it insults the intelligence of the
American people,” Ms. Pelosi said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “We
know we have to negotiate in order to reach an agreement. We all want an
agreement, make no mistake about that. But get serious.”

Nicholas Fandos and Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.
