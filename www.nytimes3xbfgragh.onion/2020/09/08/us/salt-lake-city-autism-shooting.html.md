The authorities said the officer shot the boy while responding to a call

A Salt Lake City police officer shot a 13-year-old boy with autism on
Friday night, prompting an investigation and raising concerns about
officers’ use of force in a city that has been reckoning with protests
and police accountability.

The officer fired at the boy while responding to a call about a “violent
psych issue,” Sgt. Keith Horrocks of the Salt Lake City Police
Department [told
reporters](https://kutv.com/news/local/developing-news-shooting-in-salt-lake-city)
on Saturday morning.

“In this case it was a juvenile that was having a mental episode, a
psychological episode, and had made threats to some folks with a
weapon,” Sergeant Horrocks said, adding that the officer had fired his
gun “during a short foot pursuit.”

<div class="css-1u3pw94">

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The boy’s mother, Golda Barton, identified her son to local news
reporters as Linden Cameron. She said that he did not have a weapon, and
that she had called the police to get help and possibly take him to a
hospital.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I said, ‘Look, he’s unarmed, he doesn’t have anything,’” she told KUTV
in Salt Lake City. “He just gets mad and he starts yelling and
screaming. He’s a kid. He’s trying to get attention. He doesn’t know how
to regulate.”

She said that as her son was running away, she heard a series of bangs
and did not immediately know whether Linden had been killed.

“They’re supposed to come out and be able to de-escalate a situation
using the most minimal force possible,” said Ms. Barton, who did not
immediately respond to a request for an interview on Tuesday.

Sergeant Horrocks said that the boy was in “serious condition” when he
was taken to a hospital on Friday. He said that there was “no
indication” that Linden had a weapon but added that an investigation
was still underway.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The shooting is being investigated by officers in Utah who are not
members of the Salt Lake City Police Department. The police in Salt Lake
City are expected to release body camera footage of the episode by Sept.
21.

“I know that these things are very difficult for the community as a
whole, and there is a process in terms of looking at what happened and
investigating it,” said Detective Greg Wilking, a spokesman for the
Police Department. He declined to name the officer who fired a weapon.

“Good, bad or in between, that process will be carried out, and we will
make the body-worn camera available and hold our officers accountable if
that’s what needs to happen,” he said.

The episode raised concerns about [how the police handle interactions
with people with
autism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/27/well/family/autism-special-needs-police.html)
or who are dealing with mental illness.

According to a 2017 study from the [Autism
Institute](https://drexel.edu/AutismInstitute/) at Drexel University, an
estimated [one in five teenagers with autism are stopped and questioned
by the police by the time they
turn 21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27844248). And according to
[research by the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu/news/chop-researchers-present-new-findings-2019-international-society-autism-research-annual-meeting),
people with disabilities, including those on the autism spectrum, are
disproportionately injured in interactions with the police and are five
times more likely to be incarcerated than people in the general
population.

“There are plenty of systemic biases against autistic and mentally ill
people” in Utah, said Whitney Lee Geertsen, the founding director of
[Neurodiverse
U](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/neurodiverseutah/)tah, a group
that promotes autism acceptance and self-advocacy. She called for more
police training on neurodiversity and said that the officers involved in
the shooting on Friday should be fired.

The Salt Lake City police have repeatedly come under criticism this
year.

In July, Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah [declared a state of
emergency](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/us/utah-state-of-emergency.html)
in response to protests in Salt Lake City after the authorities said
that the fatal police shooting of a 22-year-old man, Bernardo
Palacios-Carbajal, in May was justified.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

And in August, the authorities [suspended the use of police dogs in
arrests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/13/us/salt-lake-city-police-dog.html)
after one bit a Black man, Jeffery Ryans, 36. He was on one knee with
his hands in the air after officers were called to his house after
someone heard him arguing with his wife in April, [The Salt Lake Tribune
reported](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/08/11/salt-lake-city-police-dog/).

Mayor Erin Mendenhall said that a police officer, who was not named, was
suspended from duty pending an investigation. Ms. Mendenhall said she
was “disturbed” by what she saw in a body camera video of the episode,
in which a dog could be seen lunging at Mr. Ryans and biting him as he
pleaded for the police to stop.

The mayor said there would be “a thorough review of the breakdown in
communication to ensure that it does not happen again.”

Last month, Ms. Mendenhall [signed an executive
order](https://www.slc.gov/mayor/2020/08/03/mayor-mendenhall-slcpd-chief-mike-brown-announce-substantive-policy-changes/)
that aimed to restrict the use of force by the police and promote
de-escalation tactics. It was to take effect no later than Saturday, the
day after Linden was shot.

On Tuesday, Mr. Wilking, the police department spokesman, said the
adoption of those changes was still underway. He added that all of the
department’s officers had been trained in crisis intervention, which
focuses on interactions with people who have disabilities or are
experiencing mental health emergencies.

In her interview with KUTV, Ms. Barton asked why the police had not used
a Taser or rubber bullets instead of a gun. “He’s a small child,” she
added. “Why don’t you just tackle him?”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In a statement on Tuesday, Ms. Mendenhall said she was “thankful this
young boy is alive and no one else was injured.”

“No matter the circumstances, what happened on Friday night is a tragedy
and I expect this investigation to be handled swiftly and transparently
for the sake of everyone involved,” she said.
