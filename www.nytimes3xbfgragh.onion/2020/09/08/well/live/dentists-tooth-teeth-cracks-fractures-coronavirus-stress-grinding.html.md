“How’s your dental practice?” a friend of mine asked, brow furrowed,
concern evident on her face.

I’ve seen this look a lot recently. Since the onset of the pandemic,
with a citywide shutdown and social distancing measures firmly
entrenched, more than a handful of friends and family members have
presumed I must be on the brink of closing. But I let her know that I am
busier than ever.

“Really?” she asked. “How’s that possible?”

“I’ve seen more tooth fractures in the last six weeks than in the
previous six years,” I explained.

Unfortunately, that’s no exaggeration.

I closed my midtown Manhattan practice to all but dental emergencies in
mid-March, in line with American Dental Association guidelines and state
government mandate. Almost immediately, I noticed an uptick in phone
calls: jaw pain, tooth sensitivity, achiness in the cheeks, migraines.
Most of these patients I effectively treated via telemedicine.

But when I reopened my practice in early June, the fractures started
coming in: at least one a day, every single day that I’ve been in the
office. On average, I’m seeing three to four; the bad days are six-plus
fractures.

What’s going on?

One obvious answer is stress. From [Covid-induced
nightmares](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/style/why-weird-dreams-coronavirus.html)
to
“[doomsurfing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/technology/coronavirus-doomsurfing.html)”
to
“[coronaphobia](https://www.wellandgood.com/coronavirus-anxiety-scale-coronaphobia/),”
it’s no secret that pandemic-related anxiety is affecting our collective
mental health. That stress, in turn, leads to clenching and grinding,
which can damage the
teeth.

But more specifically, the surge I’m seeing in tooth trauma may be a
result of two additional factors.

First, an unprecedented number of Americans are suddenly working from
home, often wherever they can cobble together a makeshift workstation:
on the sofa, perched on a barstool, tucked into a corner of the kitchen
counter. The awkward body positions that ensue can cause us to [hunch
our shoulders
forward](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/well/live/ergonomics-work-from-home-injuries.html),
curving the spine into something resembling a C-shape.

If you’re wondering why a dentist cares about ergonomics, the simple
truth is that nerves in your neck and shoulder muscles lead into the
temporomandibular joint, or TMJ, which connects the jawbone to the
skull. Poor posture during the day can translate into a grinding problem
at night.

Second, most of us aren’t getting the restorative sleep we need. Since
the onset of the pandemic, I’ve listened to patient after patient
describe sudden restlessness and insomnia. These are hallmarks of an
overactive or dominant sympathetic nervous system, which drives the
body’s “fight or flight” response. Think of a gladiator preparing for
battle: balling his fists, clenching his jaw. Because of the stress of
coronavirus, the body stays in a battle-ready state of arousal, instead
of resting and recharging. All that tension goes straight to the teeth.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

So what can we do?

You’d be surprised how many people are unaware that they’re clenching
and grinding. Even patients who come into the office complaining of pain
and sensitivity are often incredulous when I point it out. “Oh, no. I
don’t grind my teeth,” is a refrain I hear over and over again, despite
the fact that I’m often *watching* them do it.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Awareness is key. Are your teeth currently touching? Even as you read
this article? If so, that’s a sure sign that you’re doing some damage —
your teeth shouldn’t actually touch throughout the day at all unless
you’re actively eating and chewing your food. Instead, your jaw should
be relaxed, with a bit of space between the teeth when the lips are
closed. Be mindful, and try to stop yourself from grinding when you
catch yourself doing it.

If you have a night guard or retainer, devices that keep the teeth in
proper alignment and prevent grinding, try popping them in during the
day. These appliances provide a physical barrier, absorbing and
dispersing pressure. As I often tell my patients, I’d much rather you
crack a night guard than crack a tooth. Your dentist can custom make a
night guard to assure proper fit.

And since many of us will be continuing to work from home for months, it
is imperative to set up a proper work station. Ideally, when seated,
your shoulders should be over your hips, and your ears should be over
your shoulders. Computer screens should be at eye level; prop up your
monitor or laptop on a box or a stack of books if you don’t have an
adjustable chair or
desk.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Consider, too, that in our new home offices, it’s not uncommon to roll
out of bed, find a couch, then sit for nine hours a day. Try to mix it
up with some standing, whenever possible, and incorporate more movement.
Use each and every bathroom break, or phone call, as an opportunity to
take more steps, no matter how small your home or apartment might be.

At the end of the workday, I advise my patients to — excuse the very
technical, medical term here — “wiggle like a fish.” Lie down on the
floor on your back, with your arms extended straight above your head,
and gently wiggle your arms, shoulders, hips and feet from side to side.
The goal is to decompress and elongate the spine, as well as release and
relieve some of that tension and pressure.

If you’ve got a bathtub, consider taking a 20-minute Epsom salt soak in
the evening. Focus on breathing through your nose and relaxing, rather
than thinking about work, scrolling through emails, or contemplating
your kids’ back-to-school schedule (easier said than done, I know).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Then, right before bed, take five minutes to quiet your mind. Close your
eyes, suction your tongue to the roof of your mouth, and breathe in and
out through your nose, in and out through your nose. It’s a decidedly
low-tech solution, but deep breathing is one of the most effective ways
to stimulate the vagus nerve, which controls the body’s parasympathetic
nervous system. ** A counterpart to the fight or flight response, the
parasympathetic nervous system triggers the body’s “rest and digest”
mechanism, slowing the heart rate, lowering blood pressure, allowing for
more restful, restorative sleep. The more relaxed your body, the more
likely you are to wake up with less tension in the jaw. That means less
grinding at night.

Teeth are naturally brittle, and everyone has tiny fissures in their
teeth from chewing, grinding and everyday use. They can take only so
much trauma before they eventually break. Think of a wall that has a
tiny spider crack that, with weathering, can become bigger and bigger
until it becomes a gaping hole. We want to prevent any added stress from
grinding that could cause these microscopic cracks to propagate into
larger cracks and, ultimately, a catastrophic failure requiring root
canal, a crown or other major dental treatment.

If you haven’t already done so, make an appointment with your dentist.
Stay up on your six-month screening and cleaning schedule.

And if you do nothing else, get a night guard.
