# ‘The Lockdown Killed My Father’: Farmer Suicides Add to India’s Virus Misery

SIRSIWALA, India — Randhir Singh was already deeply in debt when the
coronavirus pandemic struck. Looking out at his paltry cotton field by
the side of a railway track, he walked in circles, hopeless. In early
May, he killed himself by lying on the same track.

“This is what we feared,” said Rashpal Singh, Mr. Singh’s 22-year-old
son, choking back tears in his family home in Sirsiwala, a small village
in the northern Indian state of Punjab. “The lockdown killed my father.”

Months ago, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed one of the world’s
strictest lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Mr.
Singh’s livelihood came crashing down. His one-acre farm had barely
produced enough cotton to cover the cost of growing it, and the lockdown
even robbed him of his side job as a bus driver.

The measures, economists say, are [forcing millions of households into

and contributing to a long-running tragedy: farmer suicides.

Farm bankruptcies and debts like the one that tormented Mr. Singh have
been the source of misery in the country for decades, but experts say
the suffering has reached new levels in the pandemic.

“This crisis is the making of this government,” said Vikas Rawal, a
professor of economics at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi,
the capital. Mr. Rawal, who has spent the last 25 years studying
agrarian distress in India, said that he believes thousands of people
who live and work on farms have most likely killed themselves in the
last few months.

was massive underreporting of deaths, and even the media could not reach

A spokeswoman from the Ministry of Agriculture in New Delhi declined to
answer questions about farmer suicides. The office of the chief minister
of Punjab also declined to comment, citing the demands of the
coronavirus

Over the last five years, farmer suicides in Punjab increased by more
than 12 times, [according to government
data](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/adsi-2014%20full%20report.pdf).
Three to four farm deaths are reported in the local news almost every
day.

The state’s lush green fields that stretch all the way into the horizon
mask decades of crippling debt and abuse of land. In the 1960s, the
government introduced the high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat that
eventually made India self-sufficient in grains. But over the years,
groundwater dropped to critical levels.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Farmers, struggling to save their crops, dug their bore wells even
deeper. And to fend off increasing pest attacks, they loaded their
fields with chemicals. The skyrocketing agricultural costs forced many
farmers to take on more debt, and crop failures over the years
eventually destroyed generations of rural families.

Twenty years ago, Nirmal Singh’s father drank a bottle of pesticide when
he lost most of the land he owned to a huge debt of nearly two million
rupees, about $26,700. Then Mr. Singh’s sister took her own life because
the family could not afford to bear the expenses for her wedding.

In 2016, Mr. Singh’s son died by putting himself in the path of a train
after their cotton fields were devoured by whiteflies. “He was just 23,”
said Mr. Singh, pointing to a framed portrait of his
son.

Mr. Singh is trapped under a punishing debt of $20,000 that he
accumulated over the years to keep his farm running. But farming, he
said, is more unprofitable than ever. On a sweltering June afternoon, he
walked gingerly through his parched fields. “Have you ever heard of a
politician or an industrialist committing suicide?” he asked. “It’s
always a farmer or a laborer.”

In his village alone, a suicide takes place almost every month, he said.
“We are left with no tears,” he said. “It has turned our hearts to
stone.”

Mr. Singh says he is spending even more money to run his farm these days
because Mr. Modi’s government raised fuel prices in the middle of the
pandemic, citing the costs of the lockdown. “Modi promised ‘better
days,’ but he has only brought the worst days so far,” said Mr. Singh,
adding that fertilizers and pesticides prices have also increased under
Mr.
Modi.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Desperate and jobless for nearly three months because of the lockdown,
the workers demanded double and triple their usual rates.

In the early days of the lockdown, farmers were so constricted that they
were only able to bring [a small fraction of their
produce](https://coronapolicyimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sserwp2001-2.pdf)
to the market. Unable to sell their crops, they [set their farms on
fire](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-no-mill-amid-lockdown-punjab-farmer-burns-sugarcane-worth-rs-5-lakh-2255613)
and dumped millions of dollars worth of fruits and vegetables on the
roads or plowed them back into the fields.

Leela Singh, a farmer in Akanwali village, feared his farm would be
seized and tried to borrow a few thousand rupees, about $100, to help
him stay afloat. Unable to secure the loan, he hanged himself in June,
said Gurpreet Singh, his 24-year-old son, who dropped out of school so
the family could save on tuition fees. “We are now having to beg for
money from someone or the other,” he said.

In early June, Mr. Modi’s government used its executive powers to push
through [sweeping
changes](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1629033) aimed at
privatizing agriculture. It promised farmers greater freedom to sell
their produce outside large agricultural markets taxed by state
governments.

In August, thousands of farmers gathered to protest the new orders,
[burning their copies in the
street](https://twitter.com/ramanmann1974/status/1294625753363910657?s=20)
and arguing the orders could expose them to a monopoly of corporate
buyers rather than empowering them.

On a recent afternoon in Nirmal Singh’s village, dozens of women and
children led a procession to mark an ancient ritual: the funeral of a
doll made of dry twigs and wrapped in fine silk. It is believed the
funeral forces the gods to unleash rain and ease suffering on earth.

“Look what you have done to our daughter,” the women sing in unison,
some grieving, beating their breasts and throwing their hands up in the
air. After the ceremony, it began to rain. The ritual worked, said Mr.
Singh. Some of their suffering had been relieved.
