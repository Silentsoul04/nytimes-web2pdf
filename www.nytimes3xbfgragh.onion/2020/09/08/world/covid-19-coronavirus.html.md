Britain is expected to limit most social gatherings to six people after
a spike in cases. A political uproar quashed plans for targeted
lockdowns in Israel. People caught maskless in Indonesia were told to
lie in a coffin as punishment.

## AstraZeneca halts a vaccine trial to investigate a participant’s illness.

The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca halted global trials of its
coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday because of a serious and unexpected
adverse reaction in a participant, the company said.

The trial’s halt, which was [first reported by Stat
News](https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/),
will allow the British-Swedish company to conduct a safety review. How
long the hold will last is unclear.

In a statement, the company described the halt as a “routine action
which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness
in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the
integrity of the trials.”

In large trials like the ones AstraZeneca is overseeing, the company
said, participants do sometimes become sick by chance, but such
illnesses “must be independently reviewed to check this carefully.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The company said it was “working to expedite the review of the single
event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline” and that
it was “committed to the safety of our participants and the highest
standards of conduct in our trials.”

A person familiar with the situation, and who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that the participant had been enrolled in a Phase 2/3
trial based in the United Kingdom. The individual also said that a
volunteer in the U.K. trial had been found to have transverse myelitis,
an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and is often
sparked by viral infections. However, the timing of this diagnosis, and
whether it was directly linked to AstraZeneca’s vaccine, is unclear.

AstraZeneca’s vaccine, known as AZD1222, relies on a chimpanzee
adenovirus that has been modified to carry coronavirus genes and deliver
them into human cells. Although the adenovirus is generally thought to
be harmless, the coronavirus components of the vaccine are intended to
incite a protective immune response that would be roused again should
the actual coronavirus try to infect a vaccinated individual.

Adenoviruses, however, can sometimes trigger their own immune responses,
which could harm the patient without generating the intended form of
protection.

AstraZeneca’s vaccine is currently in Phase 2/3 trials in England and
India, and in Phase 3 trials in Brazil, South Africa and more than 60
sites in the United States. The company intended for its U.S. enrollment
to
[reach 30,000](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/phase-3-clinical-testing-us-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-begins).

Britain, seeing a sudden spike in new cases, will ban most gatherings of
more than six people beginning next week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson
is expected to announce on Wednesday.

“We need to act now to stop the virus spreading. So we are simplifying
and strengthening the rules on social contact — making them easier to
understand and for the police to enforce,” Mr. Johnson said in a
statement on Tuesday.

The new measure, which will be subject to fines beginning at 100 pounds,
will apply to both indoor and outdoor gatherings, including parks. It is
not expected to apply to workplaces, weddings, funerals or team sports.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A surge in cases this week and confusion over the current rules prompted
the new measure, which is expected to take effect on Monday. About 3,000
new cases were reported on both Sunday and Monday of this week, [the
highest daily
figures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html#cases)
since May. About [2,500 more new
cases](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) were reported on Tuesday.

The current rules allow up to 30 people for certain types of gatherings,
sowing confusion and making it difficult for officials to enforce.

In an [interview with Sky
News](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-latest-news-live-we-need-to-act-now-to-stop-the-virus-spreading-warns-boris-johnson-12067052)
on Wednesday morning, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the new
rules would not be implemented until Monday because people needed time
to read them.

“Every single person in the country needs to know what they are so we
can together keep a grip on the virus,” he said.

Mr. Hancok was asked by Sky News whether the decision by the
pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to halt global trials of its
coronavirus vaccine would set back the vaccine development process.

“Not necessarily,” he said. “It depends on what they find when they do
the investigation.”

There have been 41,586 deaths and at least 352,500 confirmed cases in
the United Kingdom as of Wednesday morning, [according to government
data](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html).

    week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/09/07/world/europe/07reuters-health-coronavirus-greece-migrants.html)
    on the Moria camp after a 40-year-old asylum seeker tested positive
    for the virus.

  - **China’s biggest air show**, originally planned for November in the
    southern city of Zhuhai, has been canceled because of the pandemic,
    its organizer said on Wednesday. The cancellation of the biennial
    China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition follows that
    of Britain’s Farnborough Airshow in July and comes amid [a steep

  - **India**’s Health Ministry

    on Tuesday that it planned to open classrooms for high school
    students on a voluntary basis, and only with their parents’
    approval, starting from Sept. 21. The vast majority of
    schoolchildren will continue to study online. The Taj Mahal will
    also open for tourism on Sept. 21, with access restricted to 5,000
    people per day. India has [more than 4.3 million cases
    overall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html)
    and reported nearly 90,000 new infections on Tuesday.

  - **Ontario**, Canada’s most populous province, said on Tuesday that
    it would take a four-week “pause” before it considers loosening
    restrictions or allowing further economic reopening. “Taking a pause
    in further reopening will help avoid broad-scale closures and
    shutdowns,”
    [said](https://twitter.com/celliottability/status/1303393588265484293)
    Christine Elliott, Ontario’s health minister. Schools across the

    that schools would most likely become vectors for the virus, and
    said that the province’s top priority was protecting them from
    transmission in the community. Ontario has reported more than 43,000

    quarantine for a week, the race reported on Tuesday. The director,
    Christian Prudhomme, had not been in direct contact with any riders,
    the race said, and no riders tested positive. The race started as
    usual on Tuesday morning. Four support staff members also tested
    positive. The race had said that teams would be ejected from the
    Tour if two members tested positive, but each of the four were from
    different teams. European news media reported that Mr. Prudhomme was
    asymptomatic. The Tour is entering its second week of three racing
    around France. Despite virus concerns, large crowds have turned up
    to watch.

  - Amid a surge in new cases, **Turkey** is requiring masks to be worn
    in all public places, including offices, factories and open-air
    spaces such as parks and beaches. The country is also reinstating
    limits on public transportation after images of jam-packed minibuses
    began circulating on social media and fights over masks broke out

Nine drug companies issued a joint pledge on Tuesday that they would
“stand with science” and not put forward a vaccine until it had been
thoroughly vetted for safety and efficacy.

The companies did not rule out seeking an emergency authorization of
their vaccines, but promised that any potential coronavirus vaccine
would be decided based on “large, high quality clinical trials” and that
the companies would follow guidance from regulatory agencies like the
Food and Drug

“We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the
rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines
are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,” the companies said.

President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a vaccine [could be
available before Election Day,
Nov. 3](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/health/covid-19-vaccine-cdc-plans.html),
heightening fears that his administration is politicizing the race by
scientists to develop a vaccine and potentially undermining public trust
in any vaccine approved.

“We’ll have the vaccine soon, maybe before a special date,” the
president said on Monday. “You know what date I’m talking about.”

Three of the companies that signed the pledge are testing their
candidate vaccines in late-stage clinical trials in the United States:
Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. But only Pfizer has said that it could
apply to the F.D.A. for emergency approval as early as October, while
the other two have said they hope to have a vaccine by the end of the
year.

that the chance of successful vaccine results by October was “very, very
low.”

In the nine companies’ statement on Tuesday, they did not mention Mr.

For millions of American schoolchildren, particularly in the Northeast,
the Tuesday after Labor Day traditionally signals the end of summer
vacation and a return to their classrooms. But this year, instead of
boarding buses and lugging backpacks, most of those students are
[opening their laptops at
home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/us/virtual-return-to-school-covid.html)
as schools commence the fall term virtually amid the pandemic.

Classes started Tuesday in some of the nation’s largest districts,
including Chicago, Houston, Dallas and Baltimore, along with many
suburbs of Washington, D.C. But almost all began the year remotely, with
some still hoping to hold classes in-person several weeks from now.

In New York City, the nation’s largest district, teachers and staff
members returned to schools on Tuesday, but the city’s 1.1 million
students won’t arrive until Sept. 21 — 10 days later than initially
planned. Mayor Bill de Blasio [announced the shift a week
ago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/nyregion/schools-open-coronavirus-nyc.html)
after many educators said classrooms would not be ready to reopen this
week.

In other parts of the country, including several states in the South and
Midwest, schools have been open for more than a month now, resulting in
a series of [student quarantines and temporary
shutdowns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/us/georgia-school-coronavirus.html)
in some districts. Others seem to have reopened without major outbreaks
— although [reporting is
uneven](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/22/us/school-reopenings-coronavirus-reporting.html),
making cases difficult to track.

While some educators spent the summer break seeking improved online
instruction, concerns have grown over the academic impact of the
pandemic, which has [widened racial and economic achievement
gaps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html).

last spring, according to an analysis of state data by The Dallas
Morning News, and 19,000 students dropped out of contact with teachers
entirely.

Several large districts in Texas that opened remotely on Tuesday have
said they plan to shift to some form of in-person instruction in the
coming months, if case numbers allow.

For some districts, technical glitches are also hampering instruction.
The Virginia Beach school district’s first day got off to a rocky start
on Tuesday as an internet outage left students and parents unable to
access online classes. “This outage is affecting schools up and down the
East Coast,” the district [announced in a Facebook

Some JPMorgan Chase employees and customers misused federal coronavirus
aid money, according to an internal memo reviewed by The New York Times.

The memo, which was sent by the bank’s operating committee on Tuesday,
said that officials had found “instances of customers misusing Paycheck
Protection Program loans, unemployment benefits and other government
programs.”

The committee, a group of senior leaders that includes its chief
executive, Jamie Dimon, as well as its chief risk officer and its
general counsel, did not describe any specific misconduct by employees,
but it said that, in general, some of the activities officials had
identified could be illegal.

“We are doing all we can to identify those instances, and cooperate with
law enforcement where appropriate,” they wrote.

to help Americans deal with the economic effects of the coronavirus.
They were in charge of vetting businesses seeking aid money, and they
also had a hand in distributing unemployment benefits that included an
extra $600 a week in federal funds.

There was never a hope of keeping fraudsters away from the money
entirely, and many lenders are scrutinizing customers’ activities. Some

As senators returned to Washington on Tuesday, their leader, Mitch
McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, announced that the Senate would vote
to advance a [scaled-back stimulus
plan](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F08%2F18%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Frepublicans-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html),
which is expected to reinstate lapsed federal unemployment benefits at
$300 per week — half their previous level — and allocate $105 billion
for schools and funds for testing and the Postal Service, according to
Republican aides familiar with the discussions.

The plan is an effort to intensify pressure on Democratic leaders, who
want to fully restore the $600 unemployment benefits and have refused to
consider any measure below $2.2 trillion.

“It does not contain every idea our party likes,” Mr. McConnell said in
a statement. “I am confident Democrats will feel the same. Yet
Republicans believe the many serious differences between our two parties
should not stand in the way of agreeing where we can agree and making
law that helps our nation.”

He added, “I will make sure every Senate Democrat who has said they’d
like to reach an agreement gets the opportunity to walk the walk.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Republicans’ bill would carry a price tag of $500 billion to $700

and smaller than the $1 trillion measure Senate Republicans introduced
in July. A procedural vote advancing the legislation could come as early
as this week, Mr. McConnell said. Democrats are likely to block it.

In a joint statement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator
Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, rejected the proposal,
declaring it “laden with poison pills Republicans know Democrats would
never support.”

“This emaciated bill is only intended to help vulnerable Republican
senators by giving them a ‘check the box’ vote to maintain the
appearance that they’re not held hostage by their extreme right-wing
that doesn’t want to spend a nickel to help people,” the two Democrats
said.

database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries),
and the death toll of 8,230 is the highest in East Asia.

Indonesia has one of the lowest rates of testing in the world, and its
positivity rate is nearly 14 percent, slightly higher than Sweden’s and
well above the 5 percent that the World Health Organization has given as
a rough benchmark for relaxing social distancing measures. (A rising
positivity rate can point to an uncontrolled outbreak; it can also
indicate that not enough testing is occurring.)

Some independent experts suspect that Indonesia’s actual number of cases
is many times higher than 200,000.

President Joko Widodo — who first admitted withholding information about
the virus to prevent panic, and later said the public must learn to live
with it — now says that protecting public health is the nation’s highest
priority.

“The key to our economy, for the economy to be good, is good health,” he
said this week. “This means that our focus is still, number one, on
health.”

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Flouting the requirement to wear a mask in public in Jakarta is
punishable by a fine of up to $67 for repeat offenders, a substantial
sum for many residents.

In a South Jakarta neighborhood, local authorities recently drove a
pickup truck through the streets carrying a coffin, flanked by people
dressed as medical personnel. An officer called out over a loudspeaker
that anyone caught without a mask would be required to spend five
minutes inside.

In East Java Province’s Probolinggo Regency, an area hit hard by the
virus, the authorities offered violators a choice of punishments,
including sitting in a hearse next to a coffin, doing push-ups or
cleaning streets, said Ugas Irwanto, the security coordinator for the
regency’s Covid-19 task force.

So far, he said, about 75 people had been caught and punished. Some were
too scared to sit in the hearse, he said, and chose to pick up a broom
instead.

## Trump returns to a familiar theme: denouncing virus restrictions.

As the presidential campaign entered the post-Labor Day sprint to the
finish line, President Trump returned to a familiar theme this week:
minimizing the threat posed by the virus, sometimes in ways that
contradict the advice of federal health authorities.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to insist that “New York
City [must stop the Shutdown
now](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1303305303249870854?s=20)”
and then to claim that virus restrictions in other states were “only
being [done to hurt the economy
prior](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1303313054281666584?s=20)to
the most important election, perhaps, in our history.”

A day earlier he criticized a reporter for wearing a mask at a White
House news conference, despite[guidance from the Centers for Disease
Control and
Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)that
“everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people
who don’t live in your household.”

And at an outdoor gathering on Tuesday in North Carolina with a large
crowd, where many of his supporters did not wear masks, he accused
Joseph R. Biden Jr., again, of “undermining scientists” with
“anti-vaccine rhetoric” because he has raised questions about whether
Mr. Trump was rushing a vaccine out to help his political chances in
November.

It was part of a familiar pattern for Mr. Trump, who back in March began
[pushing for states to reopen by Easter, on
April 12](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-easter.html).
(More than 160,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the United
States since Easter, according to a New York Times database.) In
mid-April Mr. Trump sided with protesters who were chafing at virus
restrictions, calling to “LIBERATE” several states including
[Minnesota](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251168994066944003)
and
[Virginia](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372),
which both saw cases rise in subsequent weeks. And in June he held an
in-person campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., [which local health officials
said likely contributed to more
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/us/politics/coronavirus-tulsa-trump-rally.html)
there.

The outbreak in the United States is one of [the worst in the
world](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html):
it has the most reported total cases, more 6.3 million, and the most
reported deaths, more than 189,000, according to [a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
And it has lagged other wealthy nations [when it has come to taming the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/us/coronavirus-us.html).

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When many parts of the country were reeling from the virus in the
spring, West Virginia was enviably quiet. It was the last of the 50
states to have a confirmed case, and its daily tallies of new cases
remained low, topping 100 only once before July. But as summer comes to
an end, the state’s fortunes have changed significantly for the worse.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Cases started climbing in July and, after a brief dip in late August,
have been shooting upward since. The state [announced more
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/west-virginia-coronavirus-cases.html)
in the seven-day period ending Monday than in any other week of the
pandemic.

And on one important front, Gov. Jim Justice warned at a news briefing
on Tuesday, West Virginia is now worse off than any other state in the
country: [the number of new infections that researchers estimate are
arising from each single
case](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F04%2F23%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fcoronavirus-R0-explainer.html&v=3),
a measure of spread called Rt.

“We have told you a million times, we’re the oldest state, the most
vulnerable state, the state with the most illnesses, the state with the
most breathing problems,” Mr. Justice said, apparently referring to
[research that
shows](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/how-many-adults-are-at-risk-of-serious-illness-if-infected-with-coronavirus/)
West Virginia’s population is at particularly high risk of serious
illness. “We have also told you to wear your mask. And there are still
some who are not wearing their mask.”

After reopening for in-person instruction last month, [West Virginia
University announced on
Monday](https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus/announcements/class-delivery-update-september-7)
that nearly all classes at its Morgantown campus would move online for
the next two and a half weeks, because [the number of confirmed
cases](https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus/daily-test-results/morgantown#weekly-campus-testing)
on campus has spiked upward. The [university has suspended 29
students](https://wvutoday.wvu.edu/stories/2020/09/06/wvu-suspends-29-students-for-covid-19-related-violations-additional-sanctions-pending)
after reports surfaced of large fraternity parties held over the holiday
weekend in violation of quarantine orders. 

The surrounding county has one of the worst outbreaks in the state, and
is [one of nine
counties](https://wvde.us/school-reentry-metrics-protocols/) where
elementary and secondary schools are beginning this year with entirely
remote learning.

Dr. Clay Marsh, the governor’s “coronavirus czar” and the vice president
for health sciences at W.V.U., said the surge was almost inevitable.
“Covid found its way to West Virginia, just like it found its way to
every place in the world,” he said in an interview.

The state has been aggressive in many ways, he said, closing its schools
before New York State did, ordering universal testing at nursing homes
in May and imposing a statewide mask mandate in early July.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the virus chiseled away nonetheless: showing up in nursing homes,
churches and prisons; traveling in with vacationers; and spreading
quickly at newly reopened bars and restaurants.

Dr. Marsh said he was especially concerned about the foothold the virus
appears to have gained in some coal-mining counties in the south of the
state, where health care resources are fewer and conditions like black
lung are prevalent.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>The sources
of outbreaks in these smaller communities are less clear than in college
towns, making them harder to combat.

“We have done well, but we are seeing the vagaries of Covid-19,” Dr.
Marsh said. “I don’t think anybody escapes it.”

    the city’s sheriff, Joseph Fucito, said Tuesday that in late August

    passengers to fill out [the state’s required travel
    form](https://forms.ny.gov/s3/Welcome-to-New-York-State-Traveler-Health-Form)

    slumping](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/business/economy/new-york-office-space-coronavirus.html),
    putting its financial health and status as the world’s corporate
    headquarters at risk. Fewer than 10 percent of the city’s office
    workers had returned as of last month and just a quarter of major
    employers expect to bring their people back by the end of the year,
    according to a new survey. Only 54 percent of these companies say
    they will return by July 2021. Office work makes up the cornerstone
    of New York’s economy and property taxes from office buildings
    account for nearly 10 percent of the city’s total annual tax
    revenue.

  - Gov. Gavin Newsom of **California** announced that several counties,
    including Orange, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, could now open indoors
    at reduced capacity a variety of long-shuttered businesses,
    including restaurants, gyms and places of worship. The governor on
    Tuesday gave an update on the state’s [recently revamped opening
    process](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html),
    which sorts California’s vast and diverse counties into tiers, tying
    the level of business restrictions to case numbers and positivity
    rates. The three counties were among those allowed to move from the
    most restrictive tier, in which most businesses are still barred
    from operating
indoors.

## After an uproar, Israel backs away from a lockdown plan, raising fears as the High Holy Days approach.

In July, a veteran Tel Aviv hospital administrator, Dr. Ronni Gamzu, was
anointed Israel’s virus czar. Acknowledging previous government
mistakes, he enlisted the military to take responsibility for contact
tracing and pleaded with Israelis to take the threat seriously and wear
their masks.

He also vowed to restore the public’s trust, demanding accountability
from municipal officials while replacing the central government’s
zigzagging dictates with simple instructions that anyone should be able
to understand and embrace.

Last week, Dr. Gamzu won cabinet approval for a traffic light-themed
plan to impose strict lockdowns on “red” cities with the worst
outbreaks, while easing restrictions in “green” ones where the virus was
finding fewer victims. The goal was to avoid, or at least delay, another
economically strangling nationwide lockdown.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By Sunday, however, [Dr. Gamzu was looking more like a victim
himself](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/world/middleeast/israel-coronavirus-ronni-gamzu-netanyahu.html).

Ultra-Orthodox leaders who felt that their community was being
stigmatized revolted against the traffic light plan and directed their
ire at Dr. Gamzu’s most important backer, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

And Mr. Netanyahu, under rare public pressure from one of his most vital
constituencies, caved in on the targeted lockdown plan.

The upshot for Israel is a bleak prospect: The pandemic has mushroomed,
with Israel’s number of new cases [near the worst in the
world](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries)
on a per-capita basis. Yet the odds of stopping its march seem slim as
the Jewish High Holy Days approach.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>

Ordinarily, the New Year, Yom Kippur and Sukkot are a festive and
unifying time. Instead, there are fears that by Sept. 18, when the
holidays begin, Israel will be either overrun by the pandemic or under a
full
lockdown.

As child care centers and schools reopen in the United States, parents
are encountering another virus testing bottleneck: [Few sites will test
children](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/upshot/children-testing-shortfalls-virus.html).
Even in large cities with dozens of test sites, parents are driving long
distances and calling multiple centers to track down one accepting
children.

The age policies at testing sites reflect a range of concerns, including
differences in health insurance, medical privacy rules, holes in test
approval, and fears of squirmy or shrieking children.

The limited testing hampers schools’ ability to quickly isolate and
trace virus cases among students. It could also create a new burden on
working parents, with some schools and child care centers requiring
symptomatic children to test negative before rejoining class.

“There is no good reason not to do it in kids,” said Sean O’Leary, a
Colorado pediatrician who sits on the American Academy of Pediatrics’
committee on infectious diseases. “It’s a matter of people not being
comfortable with doing it.”

Many testing sites, including those run by cities and states, do not
test any children, or they set age minimums that exclude young children.
The age limits vary widely from place to place. Los Angeles offers
public testing without any age minimum, while San Francisco, which
initially saw only adults, recently began offering tests to children 13
and older. Dallas sets a cutoff at [5 years
old](https://www.dallascounty.org/covid-19/testing-locations.php).

Nir Menachemi, a professor of **** health policy and management at
Indiana University, called the lack of child testing a blind spot that
was interfering with school reopening plans and with efforts to
understand how the virus was spreading.

“Having a blind spot makes you not able to respond from a public health
perspective, either with the correct messaging or with the right
policies to put into place to protect the people who are vulnerable,” he
said.

Despite a steady decline in daily cases and deaths, Egypt surpassed the
100,000 mark for virus cases on Tuesday.

The Arab world’s most populous country, with over 100 million people,
Egypt endured a partial lockdown between March and June that included a
nighttime curfew; the closure of airports, restaurants and cafes; and
the suspension of prayers at all places of worship.

But life on the streets has been returning to normal, with most of those
restrictions lifted, although mask-wearing is still imposed. Flights
resumed in July, and tourism has gradually been allowed back into some
cities and attractions. Pressure has eased on the country’s underfunded
health sector, with some hospitals that had been earmarked for
quarantining virus patients returning to their normal operation.

Most school exams were canceled last semester, but the new school year
is set to begin in October, with the introduction of online teaching
along with classroom activities to relieve crowding in schools.

The pandemic had overwhelmed the country’s health system, which also
suffers a shortage in manpower with an increasing number of doctors
migrating in recent years for better career opportunities abroad.

Several doctors have been detained for publicly demanding better working
conditions — such as supplying enough personal protective equipment — as
hospitals were overflowing with patients.
