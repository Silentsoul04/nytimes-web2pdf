\subsection{AstraZeneca halts a vaccine trial to investigate a
participant's
illness.}\label{astrazeneca-halts-a-vaccine-trial-to-investigate-a-participants-illness}}

The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca halted global trials of its
coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday because of a serious and unexpected
adverse reaction in a participant, the company said.

The trial's halt, which was
\href{https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/}{first
reported by Stat News}, will allow the British-Swedish company to
conduct a safety review. How long the hold will last is unclear.

In a statement, the company described the halt as a ``routine action
which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness
in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the
integrity of the trials.''

In large trials like the ones AstraZeneca is overseeing, the company
said, participants do sometimes become sick by chance, but such
illnesses ``must be independently reviewed to check this carefully.''

The company said it was ``working to expedite the review of the single
event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline'' and that
it was ``committed to the safety of our participants and the highest
standards of conduct in our trials.''

A person familiar with the situation, and who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that the participant had been enrolled in a Phase 2/3
trial based in the United Kingdom. The individual also said that a
volunteer in the U.K. trial had been found to have transverse myelitis,
an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and is often
sparked by viral infections. However, the timing of this diagnosis, and
whether it was directly linked to AstraZeneca's vaccine, is unclear.

AstraZeneca's vaccine, known as AZD1222, relies on a chimpanzee
adenovirus that has been modified to carry coronavirus genes and deliver
them into human cells. Although the adenovirus is generally thought to
be harmless, the coronavirus components of the vaccine are intended to
incite a protective immune response that would be roused again should
the actual coronavirus try to infect a vaccinated individual.

Adenoviruses, however, can sometimes trigger their own immune responses,
which could harm the patient without generating the intended form of
protection.

AstraZeneca's vaccine is currently in Phase 2/3 trials in England and
India, and in Phase 3 trials in Brazil, South Africa and more than 60
sites in the United States. The company intended for its U.S. enrollment
to
\href{https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/phase-3-clinical-testing-us-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-begins}{reach
30,000}.

AstraZeneca is one of three companies whose vaccines are in late-stage
clinical trials in the United States.

Britain, seeing a sudden spike in new cases, will ban most gatherings of
more than six people beginning next week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson
is expected to announce on Wednesday.

``We need to act now to stop the virus spreading. So we are simplifying
and strengthening the rules on social contact --- making them easier to
understand and for the police to enforce,'' Mr. Johnson said in a
statement on Tuesday.

The new measure, which will be subject to fines beginning at 100 pounds,
will apply to both indoor and outdoor gatherings, including parks. It is
not expected to apply to workplaces, weddings, funerals or team sports.

A surge in cases this week and confusion over the current rules prompted
the new measure, which is expected to take effect on Monday. About 3,000
new cases were reported on both Sunday and Monday of this week,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html\#cases}{the
highest daily figures} since May. About
\href{https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/}{2,500 more new cases} were
reported on Tuesday.

The current rules allow up to 30 people for certain types of gatherings,
sowing confusion and making it difficult for officials to enforce.

In an
\href{https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-latest-news-live-we-need-to-act-now-to-stop-the-virus-spreading-warns-boris-johnson-12067052}{interview
with Sky News} on Wednesday morning, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said
that the new rules would not be implemented until Monday because people
needed time to read them.

``Every single person in the country needs to know what they are so we
can together keep a grip on the virus,'' he said.

Mr. Hancok was asked by Sky News whether the decision by the
pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to halt global trials of its
coronavirus vaccine would set back the vaccine development process.

``Not necessarily,'' he said. ``It depends on what they find when they
do the investigation.''

There have been 41,586 deaths and at least 352,500 confirmed cases in
the United Kingdom as of Wednesday morning,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html}{according
to government data}.

  \href{https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-19-coronavirus-ontario-september-8-update-1.5715518}{acknowledged}
  that schools would most likely become vectors for the virus, and said
  that the province's top priority was protecting them from transmission
  in the community. Ontario has reported more than 43,000 coronavirus
  cases,

  Christian Prudhomme, had not been in direct contact with any riders,
  the race said, and no riders tested positive. The race started as
  usual on Tuesday morning. Four support staff members also tested
  positive. The race had said that teams would be ejected from the Tour
  if two members tested positive, but each of the four were from

Nine drug companies issued a joint pledge on Tuesday that they would
``stand with science'' and not put forward a vaccine until it had been
thoroughly vetted for safety and efficacy.

The companies did not rule out seeking an emergency authorization of
their vaccines, but promised that any potential coronavirus vaccine
would be decided based on ``large, high quality clinical trials'' and
that the companies would follow guidance from regulatory agencies like
the Food and Drug Administration.

``We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the
rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines
are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,'' the companies said.

President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a vaccine
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/health/covid-19-vaccine-cdc-plans.html}{could
be available before Election Day, Nov. 3}, heightening fears that his
administration is politicizing the race by scientists to develop a
vaccine and potentially undermining public trust in any vaccine
approved.

``We'll have the vaccine soon, maybe before a special date,'' the
president said on Monday. ``You know what date I'm talking about.''

Three of the companies that signed the pledge are testing their
candidate vaccines in late-stage clinical trials in the United States:
Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. But only Pfizer has said that it could
apply to the F.D.A. for emergency approval as early as October, while
the other two have said they hope to have a vaccine by the end of the
year.

Late last week, Moncef Slaoui, the top scientist on Operation Warp
Speed, the federal effort to quickly bring a vaccine to market,
\href{https://www.npr.org/2020/09/03/909312697/operation-warp-speed-top-adviser-on-the-status-of-a-coronavirus-vaccine}{warned
in an interview with National Public Radio} that the chance of
successful vaccine results by October was ``very, very low.''

In the nine companies' statement on Tuesday, they did not mention Mr.
Trump, saying only that they have ``a united commitment to uphold the
integrity of the scientific process.''

The other six companies that signed the pledge were BioNTech, which is a
development partner in Pfizer's vaccine; GlaxoSmithKline; Johnson \&
Johnson; Merck; Novavax; and Sanofi. Plans for the pledge were
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/science/covid-vaccine-pharma-pledge.html}{first
made public on Friday}.

For millions of American schoolchildren, particularly in the Northeast,
the Tuesday after Labor Day traditionally signals the end of summer
vacation and a return to their classrooms. But this year, instead of
boarding buses and lugging backpacks, most of those students are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/us/virtual-return-to-school-covid.html}{opening
their laptops at home} as schools commence the fall term virtually amid
the pandemic.

Classes started Tuesday in some of the nation's largest districts,
including Chicago, Houston, Dallas and Baltimore, along with many
suburbs of Washington, D.C. But almost all began the year remotely, with
some still hoping to hold classes in-person several weeks from now.

In New York City, the nation's largest district, teachers and staff
members returned to schools on Tuesday, but the city's 1.1 million
students won't arrive until Sept. 21 --- 10 days later than initially
planned. Mayor Bill de Blasio
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/nyregion/schools-open-coronavirus-nyc.html}{announced
the shift a week ago} after many educators said classrooms would not be
ready to reopen this week.

In other parts of the country, including several states in the South and
Midwest, schools have been open for more than a month now, resulting in
a series of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/us/georgia-school-coronavirus.html}{student
quarantines and temporary shutdowns} in some districts. Others seem to
have reopened without major outbreaks --- although
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/22/us/school-reopenings-coronavirus-reporting.html}{reporting
is uneven}, making cases difficult to track.

While some educators spent the summer break seeking improved online
instruction, concerns have grown over the academic impact of the
pandemic, which has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html}{widened
racial and economic achievement gaps}. In Texas, more than
\href{https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2020/09/02/thousands-of-north-texas-children-could-be-among-the-lost-generation-of-students-after-they-stopped-participating-in-online-learning/}{100,000
children never participated in remote learning assignments} last spring,
according to an analysis of state data by The Dallas Morning News, and
19,000 students dropped out of contact with teachers entirely.

Several large districts in Texas that opened remotely on Tuesday have
said they plan to shift to some form of in-person instruction in the
coming months, if case numbers allow.

For some districts, technical glitches are also hampering instruction.
The Virginia Beach school district's first day got off to a rocky start
on Tuesday as an internet outage left students and parents unable to
access online classes. ``This outage is affecting schools up and down
the East Coast,'' the district
\href{https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/VBSchools}{announced in a

Some JPMorgan Chase employees and customers misused federal coronavirus
aid money, according to an internal memo reviewed by The New York Times.

The memo, which was sent by the bank's operating committee on Tuesday,
said that officials had found ``instances of customers misusing Paycheck
Protection Program loans, unemployment benefits and other government
programs.''

The committee, a group of senior leaders that includes its chief
executive, Jamie Dimon, as well as its chief risk officer and its
general counsel, did not describe any specific misconduct by employees,
but it said that, in general, some of the activities officials had
identified could be illegal.

``We are doing all we can to identify those instances, and cooperate
with law enforcement where appropriate,'' they wrote.

Banks
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/business/coronavirus-aid-banks.html}{played
a central role} in distributing much of the \$2.2 trillion in aid
created by the federal government under the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html\#link-1900f91a}{CARES
Act} to help Americans deal with the economic effects of the
coronavirus. They were in charge of vetting businesses seeking aid
money, and they also had a hand in distributing unemployment benefits
that included an extra \$600 a week in federal funds.

There was never a hope of keeping fraudsters away from the money
entirely, and many lenders are scrutinizing customers' activities. Some
determined criminals
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/business/ppp-small-business-fraud-coronavirus.html}{created
fake businesses} to take advantage of the forgivable loans offered by
the Paycheck Protection Program, while others got funds using stolen
identities. JPMorgan, the country's largest bank, handed out more than
\$29 billion in P.P.P. loans, the most by any lender.

It is not clear how widespread the misconduct among JPMorgan's employees
and customers had been or how it compared with other banks.

As senators returned to Washington on Tuesday, their leader, Mitch
McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, announced that the Senate would vote
to advance a
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion\%2F2020\%2F08\%2F18\%2Fus\%2Fpolitics\%2Frepublicans-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html}{scaled-back
stimulus plan}, which is expected to reinstate lapsed federal
unemployment benefits at \$300 per week --- half their previous level
--- and allocate \$105 billion for schools and funds for testing and the
Postal Service, according to Republican aides familiar with the
discussions.

The plan is an effort to intensify pressure on Democratic leaders, who
want to fully restore the \$600 unemployment benefits and have refused
to consider any measure below \$2.2 trillion.

``It does not contain every idea our party likes,'' Mr. McConnell said
in a statement. ``I am confident Democrats will feel the same. Yet
Republicans believe the many serious differences between our two parties
should not stand in the way of agreeing where we can agree and making
law that helps our nation.''

He added, ``I will make sure every Senate Democrat who has said they'd
like to reach an agreement gets the opportunity to walk the walk.''

The Republicans' bill would carry a price tag of \$500 billion to \$700
billion, far less than the
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion\%2F2020\%2F05\%2F15\%2Fus\%2Fpolitics\%2Fhouse-simulus-vote.html}{\$3.4
trillion measure Democrats passed in the House} and smaller than the \$1
trillion measure Senate Republicans introduced in July. A procedural
vote advancing the legislation could come as early as this week, Mr.
McConnell said. Democrats are likely to block it.

In a joint statement, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator
Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, rejected the proposal,
declaring it ``laden with poison pills Republicans know Democrats would
never support.''

``This emaciated bill is only intended to help vulnerable Republican
senators by giving them a `check the box' vote to maintain the
appearance that they're not held hostage by their extreme right-wing
that doesn't want to spend a nickel to help people,'' the two Democrats
said.

Some offenders caught without a mask were required to lie down in a
coffin. Others were ordered to sit in the back of a hearse.

As Indonesia's coronavirus caseload surges past 200,000, some officials
are finding creative ways to drive home the message that wearing a mask
is necessary to prevent new infections.

In East Jakarta, the authorities punished several people with time in a
coffin.

``The coffin is a symbol to remind people not to underestimate the
coronavirus,'' said Budhy Novian, head of East Jakarta's public order
agency. ``It's our effort to convey the message to the people: the
Covid-19 number is high and it causes death.''

But officials halted the practice after critics pointed out that
onlookers were violating social distancing rules by crowding around to
gawk and take photos.

Indonesia, the world's fourth ****** most populous country, passed
200,000 reported cases on Tuesday. New cases have been averaging more
than 3,000 a day for two weeks,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\#countries}{according
to a New York Times database}, and the death toll of 8,230 is the
highest in East Asia.

Indonesia has one of the lowest rates of testing in the world, and its
positivity rate is nearly 14 percent, slightly higher than Sweden's and
well above the 5 percent that the World Health Organization has given as
a rough benchmark for relaxing social distancing measures. (A rising
positivity rate can point to an uncontrolled outbreak; it can also
indicate that not enough testing is occurring.)

Some independent experts suspect that Indonesia's actual number of cases
is many times higher than 200,000.

President Joko Widodo --- who first admitted withholding information
about the virus to prevent panic, and later said the public must learn
to live with it --- now says that protecting public health is the
nation's highest priority.

``The key to our economy, for the economy to be good, is good health,''
he said this week. ``This means that our focus is still, number one, on
health.''

In Jakarta, the capital, officials erected a coffin-themed monument last
week to highlight the rising death toll and remind people to follow
coronavirus protocols.

Flouting the requirement to wear a mask in public in Jakarta is
punishable by a fine of up to \$67 for repeat offenders, a substantial
sum for many residents.

In a South Jakarta neighborhood, local authorities recently drove a
pickup truck through the streets carrying a coffin, flanked by people
dressed as medical personnel. An officer called out over a loudspeaker
that anyone caught without a mask would be required to spend five
minutes inside.

In East Java Province's Probolinggo Regency, an area hit hard by the
virus, the authorities offered violators a choice of punishments,
including sitting in a hearse next to a coffin, doing push-ups or
cleaning streets, said Ugas Irwanto, the security coordinator for the
regency's Covid-19 task force.

So far, he said, about 75 people had been caught and punished. Some were
too scared to sit in the hearse, he said, and chose to pick up a broom
instead.

conference on Monday.Credit...Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times

As the presidential campaign entered the post-Labor Day sprint to the
finish line, President Trump returned to a familiar theme this week:
minimizing the threat posed by the virus, sometimes in ways that
contradict the advice of federal health authorities.

Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to insist that ``New York
City
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1303305303249870854?s=20}{must
stop the Shutdown now}'' and then to claim that virus restrictions in
other states were ``only being
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1303313054281666584?s=20}{done
to hurt the economy prior}to the most important election, perhaps, in
our history.''

A day earlier he criticized a reporter for wearing a mask at a White
House news conference,
despite\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html}{guidance
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}that ``everyone
should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don't
live in your household.''

And at an outdoor gathering on Tuesday in North Carolina with a large
crowd, where many of his supporters did not wear masks, he accused
Joseph R. Biden Jr., again, of ``undermining scientists'' with
``anti-vaccine rhetoric'' because he has raised questions about whether
Mr. Trump was rushing a vaccine out to help his political chances in
November.

It was part of a familiar pattern for Mr. Trump, who back in March began
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/24/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-easter.html}{pushing
for states to reopen by Easter, on April 12}. (More than 160,000 people
have died of the coronavirus in the United States since Easter,
according to a New York Times database.) In mid-April Mr. Trump sided
with protesters who were chafing at virus restrictions, calling to
``LIBERATE'' several states including
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251168994066944003}{Minnesota}
and
\href{https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372}{Virginia},
which both saw cases rise in subsequent weeks. And in June he held an
in-person campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla.,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/us/politics/coronavirus-tulsa-trump-rally.html}{which
local health officials said likely contributed to more cases} there.

The outbreak in the United States is one of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{the
worst in the world}: it has the most reported total cases, more 6.3
million, and the most reported deaths, more than 189,000, according to

When many parts of the country were reeling from the virus in the
spring, West Virginia was enviably quiet. It was the last of the 50
states to have a confirmed case, and its daily tallies of new cases
remained low, topping 100 only once before July. But as summer comes to
an end, the state's fortunes have changed significantly for the worse.

Cases started climbing in July and, after a brief dip in late August,
have been shooting upward since. The state
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/west-virginia-coronavirus-cases.html}{announced
more cases} in the seven-day period ending Monday than in any other week
of the pandemic.

And on one important front, Gov. Jim Justice warned at a news briefing
on Tuesday, West Virginia is now worse off than any other state in the
country:
\href{https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https\%3A\%2F\%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion\%2F2020\%2F04\%2F23\%2Fworld\%2Feurope\%2Fcoronavirus-R0-explainer.html\&v=3}{the
number of new infections that researchers estimate are arising from each
single case}, a measure of spread called Rt.

``We have told you a million times, we're the oldest state, the most
vulnerable state, the state with the most illnesses, the state with the
most breathing problems,'' Mr. Justice said, apparently referring to
\href{https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/how-many-adults-are-at-risk-of-serious-illness-if-infected-with-coronavirus/}{research
that shows} West Virginia's population is at particularly high risk of
serious illness. ``We have also told you to wear your mask. And there
are still some who are not wearing their mask.''

After reopening for in-person instruction last month,
\href{https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus/announcements/class-delivery-update-september-7}{West
Virginia University announced on Monday} that nearly all classes at its
Morgantown campus would move online for the next two and a half weeks,
because
\href{https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus/daily-test-results/morgantown\#weekly-campus-testing}{the
number of confirmed cases} on campus has spiked upward. The
\href{https://wvutoday.wvu.edu/stories/2020/09/06/wvu-suspends-29-students-for-covid-19-related-violations-additional-sanctions-pending}{university
has suspended 29 students} after reports surfaced of large fraternity
parties held over the holiday weekend in violation of quarantine
orders.~

The surrounding county has one of the worst outbreaks in the state, and
is \href{https://wvde.us/school-reentry-metrics-protocols/}{one of nine
counties} where elementary and secondary schools are beginning this year
with entirely remote learning.

Dr. Clay Marsh, the governor's ``coronavirus czar'' and the vice
president for health sciences at W.V.U., said the surge was almost
inevitable. ``Covid found its way to West Virginia, just like it found
its way to every place in the world,'' he said in an interview.

The state has been aggressive in many ways, he said, closing its schools
before New York State did, ordering universal testing at nursing homes
in May and imposing a statewide mask mandate in early July.

But the virus chiseled away nonetheless: showing up in nursing homes,
churches and prisons; traveling in with vacationers; and spreading
quickly at newly reopened bars and restaurants.

Dr. Marsh said he was especially concerned about the foothold the virus
appears to have gained in some coal-mining counties in the south of the
state, where health care resources are fewer and conditions like black
lung are prevalent. The sources of outbreaks in these smaller
communities are less clear than in college towns, making them harder to
combat.

``We have done well, but we are seeing the vagaries of Covid-19,'' Dr.
Marsh said. ``I don't think anybody escapes it.''

In July, a veteran Tel Aviv hospital administrator, Dr. Ronni Gamzu, was
anointed Israel's virus czar. Acknowledging previous government
mistakes, he enlisted the military to take responsibility for contact
tracing and pleaded with Israelis to take the threat seriously and wear
their masks.

He also vowed to restore the public's trust, demanding accountability
from municipal officials while replacing the central government's
zigzagging dictates with simple instructions that anyone should be able
to understand and embrace.

Last week, Dr. Gamzu won cabinet approval for a traffic light-themed
plan to impose strict lockdowns on ``red'' cities with the worst
outbreaks, while easing restrictions in ``green'' ones where the virus
was finding fewer victims. The goal was to avoid, or at least delay,
another economically strangling nationwide lockdown.

By Sunday, however,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/world/middleeast/israel-coronavirus-ronni-gamzu-netanyahu.html}{Dr.
Gamzu was looking more like a victim himself}.

Ultra-Orthodox leaders who felt that their community was being
stigmatized revolted against the traffic light plan and directed their
ire at Dr. Gamzu's most important backer, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

And Mr. Netanyahu, under rare public pressure from one of his most vital
constituencies, caved in on the targeted lockdown plan.

The upshot for Israel is a bleak prospect: The pandemic has mushroomed,
with Israel's number of new cases
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\#countries}{near
the worst in the world} on a per-capita basis. Yet the odds of stopping
its march seem slim as the Jewish High Holy Days approach.

Ordinarily, the New Year, Yom Kippur and Sukkot are a festive and
unifying time. Instead, there are fears that by Sept. 18, when the
holidays begin, Israel will be either overrun by the pandemic or under a
full lockdown.

As child care centers and schools reopen in the United States, parents
are encountering another virus testing bottleneck:
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/upshot/children-testing-shortfalls-virus.html}{Few
sites will test children}. Even in large cities with dozens of test
sites, parents are driving long distances and calling multiple centers
to track down one accepting children.

The age policies at testing sites reflect a range of concerns, including
differences in health insurance, medical privacy rules, holes in test
approval, and fears of squirmy or shrieking children.

The limited testing hampers schools' ability to quickly isolate and
trace virus cases among students. It could also create a new burden on
working parents, with some schools and child care centers requiring
symptomatic children to test negative before rejoining class.

``There is no good reason not to do it in kids,'' said Sean O'Leary, a
Colorado pediatrician who sits on the American Academy of Pediatrics'
committee on infectious diseases. ``It's a matter of people not being
comfortable with doing it.''

Many testing sites, including those run by cities and states, do not
test any children, or they set age minimums that exclude young children.
The age limits vary widely from place to place. Los Angeles offers
public testing without any age minimum, while San Francisco, which
initially saw only adults, recently began offering tests to children 13
and older. Dallas sets a cutoff at
\href{https://www.dallascounty.org/covid-19/testing-locations.php}{5
years old}.

Nir Menachemi, a professor of **** health policy and management at
Indiana University, called the lack of child testing a blind spot that
was interfering with school reopening plans and with efforts to
understand how the virus was spreading.

``Having a blind spot makes you not able to respond from a public health
perspective, either with the correct messaging or with the right
policies to put into place to protect the people who are vulnerable,''
he said.

Despite a steady decline in daily cases and deaths, Egypt surpassed the
100,000 mark for virus cases on Tuesday.

The Arab world's most populous country, with over 100 million people,
Egypt endured a partial lockdown between March and June that included a
nighttime curfew; the closure of airports, restaurants and cafes; and
the suspension of prayers at all places of worship.

But life on the streets has been returning to normal, with most of those
restrictions lifted, although mask-wearing is still imposed. Flights
resumed in July, and tourism has gradually been allowed back into some
cities and attractions. Pressure has eased on the country's underfunded
health sector, with some hospitals that had been earmarked for
quarantining virus patients returning to their normal operation.

Most school exams were canceled last semester, but the new school year
is set to begin in October, with the introduction of online teaching
along with classroom activities to relieve crowding in schools.

The pandemic had overwhelmed the country's health system, which also
suffers a shortage in manpower with an increasing number of doctors
migrating in recent years for better career opportunities abroad.

Several doctors have been detained for publicly demanding better working
conditions --- such as supplying enough personal protective equipment
--- as hospitals were overflowing with patients.
