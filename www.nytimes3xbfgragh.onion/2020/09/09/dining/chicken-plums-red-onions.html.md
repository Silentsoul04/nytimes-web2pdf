Melissa Clark has a terrific new recipe in The Times this week, for a
sheet-pan dinner of [roast chicken, plums and red
onions](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021408-sheet-pan-chicken-with-roasted-plums-and-onions)
(above). She came up with it as a dish appropriate to Rosh Hashana, the
Jewish New Year, which begins on Sept. 18, but it’s outstanding whatever
your faith or lack thereof: a sticky, bright-flavored joy that you could
pair with couscous to great effect. I hope you do.

But that’s not all I hope you cook this week. I traffic in recipes most
days, strict instruction for cooking particular dishes in particular
ways. Of course, I don’t always use recipes, and most likely you don’t
either, sometimes preferring improvisation to a precise list of
commands. There’s a joy in that, in seeing where an idea takes you,
rather than following a script. (At least sometimes. I wouldn’t
freestyle a loaf of bread.)

So, for instance, you could try your hand at some Vietnamese-style
summer rice rolls, made at the table, an interactive meal. It worked out
well for me. At lunch the other day, far in advance of dinner, I cooked
rice noodles and drained them well, let them cool in the refrigerator.
Later I sliced cucumbers, scallions, carrots, picked lots of cilantro
and mint leaves, arranged them all on a platter, with a pile of the
noodles. I made a simple nuoc cham, the Vietnamese dipping sauce: glugs
of fish sauce brightened with squeezed lime juice, softened with a spray
of sugar, made fiery with thinly sliced hot peppers. (Add water to
taste.) Then I broiled some shrimp — though you could use grilled pork
or tofu — and put them on a platter next to the vegetables. Opened a
sleeve of rice wrappers, thin and translucent and stiff, and put those
on a plate, next to a big bowl of warm water, next to all the rest.

And that was dinner, with each in the family dipping a rice wrapper in
the warm water to soften it, then filling it to taste with vegetables
and protein, wrapping it up like a newborn, spooning some nuoc cham over
the top. There was a meal where before there was only a notion, and it
was grand.

But perhaps you prefer actual recipes? Naturally we have you covered.
That is our remit, after all.

If you want ones that are precise and exacting, I recommend J. Kenji
López-Alt’s [new and absolutely fascinating examination of the
Cantonese concept of wok
hei](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/dining/stir-fry-recipe-wok-hei.html),
which refers to the “wok energy” or “wok breath” of high-heat
stir-frying that results in a deep, smoky flavor. It’ll lead you to an
exemplary [smoky lo mein with shiitakes and
vegetables](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021379-smoky-lo-mein-with-shiitake-and-vegetables),
and some top-drawer [stir-fried
greens](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021378-smoky-stir-fried-greens)
as well.

Alternatively, see what you make of these [pork and ricotta
meatballs](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019765-pork-and-ricotta-meatballs)
from Kay Chun, or my [portobello patty
melts](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1018279-portobello-patty-melts)
from back in 2016. [Spicy corn and coconut
soup](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019451-spicy-corn-and-coconut-soup)
from Sarah Jampel? [Tomato
tonnato](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/12664-tomato-tonnato)
from Melissa Clark? I love David Tanis’s [summer vegetable
salad](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019518-summer-vegetable-salad)
unreservedly, as I do Alexa Weibel’s [zucchini and egg tart with
herbs](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020143-zucchini-and-egg-tart-with-fresh-herbs).

One of those should suit, but there are thousands and thousands more
recipes to consider on [NYT
Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/) as well. Go see what
you think of them, see what stirs interest, what demands to be made.
Yes, it’s true that you need a subscription to access them all, and to
use all the features of our site and apps. But subscriptions support our
work and allow it to continue. And so I hope, if you haven’t already,
that you’ll [subscribe

Thanks.

We’ll get you sorted.

Now, it’s [a Bryson DeChambeau
drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayon1s5ZT2E) from rice pilaf and
pan gravy, but Laurie Gwen Shapiro’s article in The New Yorker, on “[The
Improbable Journey of Dorothy Parker’s
Ashes](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-improbable-journey-of-dorothy-parkers-ashes),”
is a terrific thing to read.

So, too, is Kim Severson’s look at [the state of American grocery
stores](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/dining/grocery-shopping-coronavirus.html),
in The Times. And, to go along with it, try [Nick Summers’s
review](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/books/review/the-secret-life-of-groceries-benjamin-lorr.html)
of Benjamin Lorr’s new book, “The Secret Life of Groceries.” (You’ll
move on to the Lorr, after that\!)

This is Tiwa Savage and Sam Smith,
“[Temptation](https://youtu.be/Ta-4Fw7woRY),” a fine introduction to
[Jon Pareles’s profile of
Savage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/arts/music/tiwa-savage-celia.html),
also in The Times.

Finally, see what you make of “[Money
Heist](https://www.netflix.com/title/80192098),” on Netflix. It’s some
distance from the coronavirus, which is to say an escape. I’ll be back
on Friday.
