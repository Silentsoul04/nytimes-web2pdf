Melissa Clark has a terrific new recipe in The Times this week, for a
sheet-pan dinner of
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021408-sheet-pan-chicken-with-roasted-plums-and-onions}{roast
chicken, plums and red onions} (above). She came up with it as a dish
appropriate to Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which begins on Sept.
18, but it's outstanding whatever your faith or lack thereof: a sticky,
bright-flavored joy that you could pair with couscous to great effect. I
hope you do.

But that's not all I hope you cook this week. I traffic in recipes most
days, strict instruction for cooking particular dishes in particular
ways. Of course, I don't always use recipes, and most likely you don't
either, sometimes preferring improvisation to a precise list of
commands. There's a joy in that, in seeing where an idea takes you,
rather than following a script. (At least sometimes. I wouldn't
freestyle a loaf of bread.)

So, for instance, you could try your hand at some Vietnamese-style
summer rice rolls, made at the table, an interactive meal. It worked out
well for me. At lunch the other day, far in advance of dinner, I cooked
rice noodles and drained them well, let them cool in the refrigerator.
Later I sliced cucumbers, scallions, carrots, picked lots of cilantro
and mint leaves, arranged them all on a platter, with a pile of the
noodles. I made a simple nuoc cham, the Vietnamese dipping sauce: glugs
of fish sauce brightened with squeezed lime juice, softened with a spray
of sugar, made fiery with thinly sliced hot peppers. (Add water to
taste.) Then I broiled some shrimp --- though you could use grilled pork
or tofu --- and put them on a platter next to the vegetables. Opened a
sleeve of rice wrappers, thin and translucent and stiff, and put those
on a plate, next to a big bowl of warm water, next to all the rest.

And that was dinner, with each in the family dipping a rice wrapper in
the warm water to soften it, then filling it to taste with vegetables
and protein, wrapping it up like a newborn, spooning some nuoc cham over
the top. There was a meal where before there was only a notion, and it
was grand.

But perhaps you prefer actual recipes? Naturally we have you covered.
That is our remit, after all.

If you want ones that are precise and exacting, I recommend J. Kenji
López-Alt's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/dining/stir-fry-recipe-wok-hei.html}{new
and absolutely fascinating examination of the Cantonese concept of wok
hei}, which refers to the ``wok energy'' or ``wok breath'' of high-heat
stir-frying that results in a deep, smoky flavor. It'll lead you to an
exemplary
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021379-smoky-lo-mein-with-shiitake-and-vegetables}{smoky
lo mein with shiitakes and vegetables}, and some top-drawer
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1021378-smoky-stir-fried-greens}{stir-fried
greens} as well.

Alternatively, see what you make of these
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019765-pork-and-ricotta-meatballs}{pork
and ricotta meatballs} from Kay Chun, or my
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1018279-portobello-patty-melts}{portobello
patty melts} from back in 2016.
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019451-spicy-corn-and-coconut-soup}{Spicy
corn and coconut soup} from Sarah Jampel?
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/12664-tomato-tonnato}{Tomato
tonnato} from Melissa Clark? I love David Tanis's
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1019518-summer-vegetable-salad}{summer
vegetable salad} unreservedly, as I do Alexa Weibel's
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1020143-zucchini-and-egg-tart-with-fresh-herbs}{zucchini
and egg tart with herbs}.

One of those should suit, but there are thousands and thousands more
recipes to consider on
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/}{NYT Cooking} as well. Go
see what you think of them, see what stirs interest, what demands to be
made. Yes, it's true that you need a subscription to access them all,
and to use all the features of our site and apps. But subscriptions
support our work and allow it to continue. And so I hope, if you haven't
already, that you'll
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/subscription/cooking.html?campaignId=6XQHR}{subscribe
today}. Thanks.

We'll be standing by to help, if anything should go wrong in your
kitchen or our finely wrought code. Just write
\href{mailto:cookingcare@NYTimes.com}{\nolinkurl{cookingcare@NYTimes.com}},
and someone will get back to you, I promise. We'll get you sorted.

Now, it's \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayon1s5ZT2E}{a Bryson
DeChambeau drive} from rice pilaf and pan gravy, but Laurie Gwen
Shapiro's article in The New Yorker, on
``\href{https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-improbable-journey-of-dorothy-parkers-ashes}{The
Improbable Journey of Dorothy Parker's Ashes},'' is a terrific thing to
read.

So, too, is Kim Severson's look at
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/dining/grocery-shopping-coronavirus.html}{the
state of American grocery stores}, in The Times. And, to go along with
it, try
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/books/review/the-secret-life-of-groceries-benjamin-lorr.html}{Nick
Summers's review} of Benjamin Lorr's new book, ``The Secret Life of
Groceries.'' (You'll move on to the Lorr, after that!)

This is Tiwa Savage and Sam Smith,
``\href{https://youtu.be/Ta-4Fw7woRY}{Temptation},'' a fine introduction
to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/arts/music/tiwa-savage-celia.html}{Jon
Pareles's profile of Savage}, also in The Times.

Finally, see what you make of
``\href{https://www.netflix.com/title/80192098}{Money Heist},'' on
Netflix. It's some distance from the coronavirus, which is to say an
escape. I'll be back on Friday.
