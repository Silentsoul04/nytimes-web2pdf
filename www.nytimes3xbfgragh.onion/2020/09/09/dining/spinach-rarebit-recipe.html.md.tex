About}\label{a-cheesy-toast-to-dream-about}}

This riff on Welsh rarebit puts that wilting spinach in the fridge to
use in a creamy, verdant lunch.

There's a classic early 20th-century comic strip by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1987/06/09/books/books-of-the-times-568587.html}{Winsor
McCay} in which, after eating a Welsh rarebit close to bedtime,
characters fall into wild, vivid dreams --- often horrible, always
bizarre --- then wake up regretting their choice of dinner. Called
``\href{http://www.comicstriplibrary.org/browse/results?author=2}{Dream
of the Rarebit Fiend},'' I think about it every time I make myself the
cheese toast, and Tuesday was no exception.

A traditional rarebit recipe calls for melting Cheddar or a similar
cheese, mustard and Worcestershire into a sauce thinned down with beer
or milk. But, wanting to use up some droopy spinach at the back of the
fridge, I decided to add it to the pan along with a little feta.

The spinach turned my cheese toast into a complete meal --- both
exceedingly creamy and full of healthful greens. And the feta rounded
out the mellow Cheddar, adding a welcome tang.

To make one rather large rarebit, put 5 ounces of baby spinach in a
colander in the sink. Bring a kettle of water to a boil and pour it over
the spinach to wilt it. Let the spinach cool completely, then use your
hands to squeeze it tight. You could pretend the ball of spinach is a
stress reliever, and that tomorrow is your kid's first day of sixth
grade during a pandemic. My spinach dried right out. Now, chop the
spinach coarsely.

Toast a thick slice of country bread, and put it on a broiler-safe pan.
If you like, you can rub the cut side of a halved clove of garlic all
over the toast, letting the garlic mash into the toast crumb. I did, and
was glad I did, but it's not traditional.

Chop up a couple of scallions or a small shallot, and sauté in a
tablespoon of butter or olive oil until very soft, about 3 minutes. Add
a heaping teaspoon of flour, and cook it for a minute so it toasts
slightly, then stir in the spinach, a teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, ½
teaspoon dry mustard powder (or a teaspoon Dijon mustard), and a splash
of beer, wine or milk. (I used the white wine from my glass, about 1 to
2 tablespoons.)

When the spinach is well distributed in the pan, add 1 cup shredded
Cheddar and ⅓ cup crumbled feta, and stir the ingredients over low heat
until it melts. Don't worry if the feta doesn't completely dissolve. A
few white nuggets amid all the green will be fine.

Scrape the spinach mixture onto your toast, and broil it until the
cheese bubbles and singes in spots, 1 to 3 minutes.

Serve immediately. Then put a notebook next to your bed for jotting down
any vivid dreams, just in case.
