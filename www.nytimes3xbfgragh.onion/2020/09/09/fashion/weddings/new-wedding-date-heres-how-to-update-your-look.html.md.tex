With a few revisions, you can still wear the dress you had originally
envisioned.

For many brides this year, everything down to the dress was specifically
picked for a warm-weather wedding, but the coronavirus pandemic caused
them to postpone the celebration until fall or winter.

Fortunately, bridal fashion has become more seasonless, offering brides
plenty of style options for any time of year. With the following simple
additions and alterations you can still wear the dress you originally
envisioned.

\hypertarget{change-the-lining}{%
\subsubsection{Change the Lining}\label{change-the-lining}}

Sheer and tulle dresses are popular with spring and summer brides.
``Typically, spring wedding dresses feature a blush or nude lining, but
swapping it with a lining that picks up the tones of the gown will give
it a more fall or wintry feel,'' says Samantha Levis, Los Angeles-based
bridal stylist and owner of \href{https://www.theboldandbridal.com/}{the
Bold \& Bridal}. Ask your bridal boutique or a trusted seamstress to
switch the lining to a dove gray, warm white, or even a pale cerulean
for your something blue.

Winterize your original spring bridal look with a dramatic cape,
delicately-embroidered capelet, or a fun jacket. If you'd like to add a
bit of a vintage feel, go with a faux-fur capelet, such as one by
\href{https://genevieveroseatelier.com/collections/cover-ups-and-wraps}{Genevieve
Rose Atelier}. ``A cape or jacket is a nice touch when going from one
event location to the next or for photo opportunities,'' said Selina
Howard, a stylist based in New York and Atlanta and the owner of
\href{http://www.vaingloriousbrides.com/}{Vainglorious Brides by Selina
Howard}. ``It's also a great way to add another layer while staying as
close as possible to your original bridal vision.''

Layers of fabric aren't practical for most summer weddings, but winter
bridal looks can add volume and texture with detachable sleeves and
overskirts. If you're wearing a dress with shoulder straps, take
inspiration from
\href{https://www.vogue.com/article/11-things-we-know-about-princess-beatrice-royal-wedding}{Princess
Beatrice's recent bridal look}where she added charming puffed sleeves to
the vintage dress she borrowed from her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. If
you're wearing a short dress or slim-silhouetted gown, pair it with a
tulle A-line or ball gown overskirt for a fuller look. Many designers
offer detachable sleeves and skirts that pair with their designs, but
your bridal boutique or seamstress should also be able to customize your
dress. You can also find an overskirt from online bridal retailers like
\href{https://www.madeleinefig.com/copy-of-belts-sashes}{Madeleine Fig}
and
\href{https://untamedpetals.com/search?type=product\&q=overskirt}{Untamed
Petals} to match your dress.

``Going into winter, jewelry can be more whimsical and festive, as the
holidays call for sparkle and glamour,'' Ms. Levis said. Use jewels to
complement the silhouette and style of your gown, though be sure not to
over accessorize. Ms. Howard suggests choosing one statement piece that
won't detract from your dress or overall look. ``I love statement
earrings specifically because they don't compete with the veil like a
headpiece may,'' she said. And a chunky or collar necklace can be the
perfect piece to accent a strapless gown, sleek sheath, or
spaghetti-strap dress.

Accessories are a bride's best friend regardless of season. But for a
winter or fall bride, dressed-up accessories that bring to mind colder
weather --- like elegant long gloves of silk, lace or tulle --- add a
fun and useful detail. Elbow and opera-length gloves give the look of
sleeves to a strapless or sleeveless dress and easily lend to a quick
outfit change when removed.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Change Your

Shoes complete a bridal look, but they can also help to make your gown
more style appropriate for the given season. While you can wear any shoe
style that your heart desires, remember that a closed shoe can be as
flirty as open-toe summer footwear --- think a charming pair of
embroidered tulle pumps, embellished heels or sassy mules.

Look past bridal and toward the ready-to-wear runway for inspiration to
accessorize your wedding dress. Beaded and crystal-embellished sashes
have made way for more fashion-forward belts to accentuate the waist.
Wide or double-wrap belts cinch the waist and add a modern touch to
A-line and ball gown silhouettes.

Your change of date might have also led to a change in venue or event
style to accommodate a more intimate gathering. If you've decided on a
laid-back celebration at your home or the home of a loved one, a
sophisticated, yet casual bridal look may be in order. A bridal suit or
jumpsuit can fit the bill. ``I love the juxtaposition of a tailored suit
in a soft garden or backyard,'' Ms. Levis said. ``A boho look is also
lovely in this setting.'' Play with soft draping and texture to
compliment the crisp autumn air and backdrop for an outdoor affair.
``Since the event is at your home you can have a little fun with your
look,'' she said.
