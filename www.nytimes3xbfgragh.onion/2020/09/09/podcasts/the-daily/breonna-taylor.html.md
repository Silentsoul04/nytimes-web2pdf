### Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Andy Mills, Asthaa Chaturvedi and Daniel Guillemette; with help from Alexandra Leigh Young; and edited by Larissa Anderson and Alix Spiegel

#### Since the young medical worker was fatally shot in a police raid on her home, her name has become a rallying cry for protesters. In the first of two parts, we explore how officers came to raid her house.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    I got him. What’s going on, man?

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    What’s up?

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    You know what I’m stopping you for?

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    I don’t.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Man, when you turned on here, onto Dixie —

rukmini callimachi

In the spring of 2019, this video started circulating online.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Do me a favor. Put your hands on the steering wheel.

rukmini callimachi

It showed the police in the city of Louisville in Kentucky making a
traffic stop.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    I got him.

rukmini callimachi

The driver was a Black teenage boy.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Do you want to hop out?

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    Get out of the car.

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    They telling me to get out of the car now.

rukmini callimachi

He happened to be his high school’s homecoming king and a multiple
scholarship winner.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    You don’t have any weapons on you, do you?

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    I don’t.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    No drugs?

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    No.

michael barbaro

He had borrowed his mom’s car to go buy a slushie at the local store.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Turn around. Put your hands on the car for me. Spread your feet.

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    I don’t have — but I haven’t did anything.

michael barbaro

And he suddenly found himself being pulled out of the car —

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Put your hands around your back real quick.

rukmini callimachi

— being handcuffed.

  - archived recording  
    \[INTERPOSING VOICES\]

rukmini callimachi

Being searched.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Quit doing the clutching your fist thing too.

rukmini callimachi

For the offense of making a wide turn.

And this video that went viral online was far from the first time that
something like this had happened in Louisville.

  - archived recording  
    There’s a call now for a review of Metro police policies, claims of
    racial profiling on the part of the white police officer who —

rukmini callimachi

So in response, the Louisville Police Department enacted a series of
reforms.

  - archived recording  
    These changes are meant to reflect our department’s values and
    commitment to fair, professional interactions with the public. We
    have work to do in terms of building trust and legitimacy with the
    people that we have sworn to serve and protect.

rukmini callimachi

And yet, those very reforms set into motion a raid that a few months
later killed a 26-year-old woman.

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    We want justice\!

  - archived recording (crowd)  
    We want justice\!

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    Justice for who?

rukmini callimachi

Her name was Breonna Taylor.

  - archived recording (crowd)  
    Breonna Taylor.

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    I can’t hear you\! Justice for who?

— the name Breonna Taylor —

  - archived recording  
    (SINGING) Say her name\! Breonna Taylor.

michael barbaro

But unlike George Floyd, Eric Garner or Rayshard Brooks, there’s no
video capturing the final moments of her life.

  - archived recording (cardi b)  
    Do you know Breonna Taylor’s story, her whole story?

michael barbaro

Today: A Times investigation pieces together what actually happened to
Breonna Taylor. In part one, Rukmini Callimachi tells the story of how
police ended up at her door. It’s Wednesday, September 9.

  - rukmini callimachi  
    All right, let’s get started. OK?

  - archived recording  
    Mhm.

michael barbaro

Rukmini, where does your reporting start for this story?

rukmini callimachi

So I met my colleague, the documentary filmmaker, Yoruba Richen, in
Louisville.

  - yoruba richen  
    So can you start off by telling me your names and what your relation
    is to Breonna?

rukmini callimachi

And we spent the next couple of weeks speaking to the people who knew
Breonna best.

  - tamika palmer  
    My name’s Tamika Palmer. I have two daughters.

rukmini callimachi

Her mom.

  - tamika palmer  
    Breonna Taylor, Ju’Niyah Palmer.

  - kenneth walker  
    My name is Kenneth Walker.

rukmini callimachi

Her boyfriend.

  - preonia flakes  
    My name is Preonia Flakes. And I am Breonna’s cousin.

rukmini callimachi

Her cousins.

  - preonia flakes  
    I would say our relationship was more like sisters, twin cousins.
    Pre and Bre.

rukmini callimachi

Her very best friends going all the way back to her childhood. Her
co-workers. And in combination with the thousands of pages of documents
that I was able to acquire about her case, what comes across is that
this is a young woman who was dealt, I would say a pretty tough hand in
life.

  - yoruba richen  
    What was your reaction when you find out you were pregnant? How old
    were you?

  - tamika palmer  
    \[LAUGHS\] I was, like, in disbelief. I was 16 years old though. So
    —

rukmini callimachi

She was born to a teenage mom.

  - tamika palmer  
    I just knew I had to be a better person then, at that point. So I
    took it on.

rukmini callimachi

Her dad was convicted on a murder and drug charge when she was just six
years old and was sent to prison for the rest of her life.

  - yoruba richen  
    What was she like as a child?

  - tamika palmer  
    Breonna was a good kid. She was easy, even just as a young kid. She
    just was — she was smart.

rukmini callimachi

But what you also see amidst the challenges of her early life is a
person who was trying to push beyond the limitations of her
circumstances.

  - tamika palmer  
    She was one of those people, she made a plan, and she went. That was
    it. Like, it has to be done this way. And, like, OK.

  - preonia flakes  
    Just seeing how she was wanting to be successful, she kind of, like,
    drove that into my head. Like, this is what we’re going to do. This
    is how you’re going to do it. And I’m going to show you how to do
    it.

rukmini callimachi

We spoke to one of her oldest friends who said that her mom, when they
were children, would not let her go to sleepovers at all, except if the
sleepover was at Breonna’s house. Why? Because Breonna was considered
the responsible one. She was the one among their little group of friends
who made sure that the other girls got to school on time if there was a
sleepover, who made sure that they did their homework. She seemed to be
taking almost an adult role in her immediate circle.

  - tamika palmer  
    Even as a kid, I can remember her being 7 years old, saying to my
    mother, let me check your blood sugar.

rukmini callimachi

When she was very young, she started to show an interest in medicine,
and in health care and in helping other people. Her mom describes how,
when Breonna learned that her grandmother had an insulin problem, she
wanted to prick her grandmother’s finger with a needle and draw blood so
that she could test her blood sugar level. She thought that that was
interesting. And she kept on asking her grandmother if she could do
that.

  - tamika palmer  
    Like, leave her alone\! But she — my mother would let her stick her
    finger in. And she was so pumped up to do it. And helped her do her
    insulin. I’m like, oh, my God.

rukmini callimachi

We see that in ninth grade, she begged her mom to give her permission to
take the bus and to go start working at a local fast food joint after
school. Her friends say that they never really knew her without a job.

  - preonia flakes  
    She taught me stuff my own people, my own siblings, my own mother
    didn’t teach me. The family I came from, really not supportive. So I
    used to make little Facebook statuses like, who’s going to come to
    my graduation if I had it, even though I know y’all don’t really
    mess with me? Bre would be, like, don’t worry about them. And as
    long as I’m by your side, that’s all that matters. Because I’m a
    leader.

rukmini callimachi

Breonna is the first person in her family to graduate from high school.
And she then goes to college.

  - yoruba richen  
    Tell me how you met?

  - kenneth walker  
    We met, I guess on Twitter.

rukmini callimachi

In college, she starts a banter on Twitter with another college student.

  - kenneth walker  
    Kind of like, flirting on the timeline, I guess, so to say.

rukmini callimachi

His name was Kenneth Walker. He went by Kenny to all of his friends.

  - kenneth walker  
    And she went to University of Kentucky. And I went to Western
    Kentucky.

rukmini callimachi

And they start a sort of emoji-filled, flirtatious Twitter banter that,
by 2016, evolved into the beginnings of a romance and of a relationship.

  - kenneth walker  
    I kept on telling her I don’t want to be friends no more. But we can
    be if we have to be. But I don’t want to be.

rukmini callimachi

It was an on again, off again relationship. But what’s clear in this
back and forth is that Kenny seemed to really have identified her as the
person that he wanted to be his life partner.

  - kenneth walker  
    Seems like when nobody else was there for me, she was always there.

rukmini callimachi

And it was Breonna that wasn’t 100 percent sure about him.

  - kenneth walker  
    Some days it was, yeah, let’s marry and have a kid. And then other
    days, like, no, let’s be single and live kid-free lives. So there
    was a million time when I’d say I’m not messing with her anymore
    ever again. And I’m sure she said the same thing several times.

rukmini callimachi

But everybody we spoke to described him as somebody who genuinely loved
her.

  - kenneth walker  
    We can be friends. And we can be everything else, too. That’s the
    goal when you trying to be with somebody or love them, whatever. You
    want to be friends with them also. And that’s rare. So if you come
    across that, I think you should try to take advantage of it.

rukmini callimachi

What we now know is that a few months after she started dating Kenny in
2016, she also starts seeing another man. His name is Jamarcus Glover.
And by all accounts, he’s, in many ways, the opposite of Kenny.

Jamarcus is a twice convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced in 2008 when
he was 18 years old in Mississippi, his home state, for drug
trafficking. And later in 2014, he moves to Kentucky. He’s charged again
for drug possession. And he would spend the next several years in and
out of jail.

And it bears noting that he seems to enter her life at what was
ostensibly a low point. She had started college. But she dropped out
because she felt homesick and was really missing her family. She got her
E.M.T. certification and began working as a first responder, riding
ambulances. But a year into that job, she quit. On social media, she
says that she was discouraged by the 16-hour shifts and by the low pay.
And pretty soon into her relationship with Jamarcus, his problems become
her problems.

  - archived recording  
    \[KNOCKING ON DOOR\] And this is the first time that you see the
    police coming and knocking on the door of Apartment 4 at 3003
    Springfield Drive.

    \[KNOCKING ON DOOR\]

  - archived recording 2  
    \[DOOR OPENS\]

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Breonna?
    
    Is this is your place?

  - breonna taylor  
    Yes.

rukmini callimachi

And they came because of a favor that she had done for him.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    OK. So what’s your name, young man?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Jamarcus.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    What’s that?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Jamarcus.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Jamarcus. What’s your last name?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Glover.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Glover?

rukmini callimachi

So what happened is she had rented a car. Her own car was apparently in
the shop. So she had rented a car from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. And
Jamarcus Glover asked her for the keys. She handed over the keys. He
then handed them to a third person, a man. And a couple of hours later,
that person was found dead, slumped over the wheel of the car. His body
was riddled with bullets. And on the floorboard of the car and in the
console, they found several baggies of drugs.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    What I need to know is what’s going on with the rental car and the
    person that was in the car.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I don’t know who was in the car.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    She let me use the car.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    — back at home, and that’s all I know.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Mhm.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    That’s all I know.

rukmini callimachi

The person that ends up dead at the wheel of the car is a man that’s
known to them only by his nickname Rambo. And in fact, he’s the brother
of one of Jamarcus Glover’s associates, a member of what turns out to be
a criminal drug syndicate. And that man had gone to jail on multiple
occasions with Jamarcus.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Are you all into the game?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Oh, no.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    I mean, come on now.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Well I mean, I roll with them. \[INAUDIBLE\]

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    And let’s just be honest right here, OK?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    I roll with them. But they ain’t got nothing to do with a gang. They
    —

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    I’m not saying gang. I said the game. Are you working? How did he
    make his money? How do you make your money?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Oh, no, no. Ain’t — hell, no. \[INAUDIBLE\]

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Are you working now?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    No.

  - archived recording (officer 2)  
    Where you work at?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I don’t work right now. I just left my job over the weekend.

  - archived recording (officer 2)  
    Where were you?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    E.M.S., Louisville Metro.

  - archived recording (officer 2)  
    What were you doing for them?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    E.M.T.

rukmini callimachi

I saw the police notes. And they concluded that Breonna really had no
foreknowledge of how this car was going to be used. And that Jamarcus
also did not appear to be aware that this man was going to get killed.

  - archived recording  
    \[CHATTER\]

  - archived recording (officer 2)  
    All right, man. Hey, take care of yourself, all right?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    All right.

  - archived recording  
    \[RADIO SOUNDS\]

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    See you later, lady.

  - archived recording (officer 2)  
    Be careful, all right?

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Rukmini, when you talked to Breonna’s family and her friends, did
Jamarcus come up? And what did they say about him?

rukmini callimachi

You know, this was really hard to get at. Because when we spoke to her
mother, her cousins, her best friends, you ask about Jamarcus Glover and
either they stopped making eye contact with you, or they say to you that
they don’t want to talk about him. Or they say to you that they don’t
know him. And this relationship is something that we have essentially
uncovered through documents.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

rukmini callimachi

This was clearly something that those who love her did not want to talk
about. The closest I got was one of her oldest childhood friends,
somebody who’s known her since she was in elementary school. And all she
would say to me was, I didn’t like him — regarding Jamarcus.

But what we see in the documents that we’ve amassed is that in the next
four years, she was on again and off again with Kenny and with Jamarcus.
And in the periods that she’s with Jamarcus, he repeatedly entangles her
in his problems and in his run-ins and dealings with police. This is a
man who is in and out of jail. And he asks her to pay his bail twice in
2017.

And then later, in 2019, you see her paying bail for another man,
another accused drug dealer who was a friend of Jamarcus’s, and who was
believed to be part of this criminal syndicate alongside him.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Are you saying something about work?

rukmini callimachi

That same year, 2019 —

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Do me a favor. Put your hands on the steering wheel.

rukmini callimachi

— that’s the year that the video of the homecoming king getting pulled
over by Louisville police goes viral.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Now do me a favor. Grab your phone and your wallet and stick it on
    the seat.

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    Why?

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Because I’m telling you. Or it’s going to fall out when you get out
    of the vehicle.

rukmini callimachi

And when he gets pulled over for the infraction of making a wide turn,
things very quickly escalate.

He’s pulled out of his car by the white police officer.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Yeah. We’re allowed to pat you down copper for a wide turn.

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    Mama, they patting me down\!

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Yep. We’re allowed to do that.

rukmini callimachi

He’s on the phone with his mom. And the cops begin searching his car for
drugs.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    — and stay over here, please. Ma’am, please stay over here.

rukmini callimachi

His mom eventually shows up.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Stay over there, please. If you approach my traffic stop, I will
    take you.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    He’s my son.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Ma’am, if you approach my traffic stop, I will take you to jail. I
    don’t care\!

rukmini callimachi

And in the conversation that ensues, another officer begins to explain
to the mom the larger strategy of what they’re trying to do with these
traffic stops.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    What I’m saying is, if it’s a wrong turn, give him a ticket. You
    don’t have to bring —

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    That’s not what we’re out here for. OK?

  - archived recording (mother)  
    What are you out here for? That’s what he said.

  - archived recording  
    We’re a violent — we’re a violent crimes unit. First, we’re not
    narcotics. OK.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    But what do you mean violent?

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    So listen. Just — will you listen to me? Because I want to explain —

rukmini callimachi

What they would do is they would identify an area that had a high crime
rate. And then they would flood that area with police officers who would
pull people over for minor offenses — for turning without signaling, for
having a broken tail light, for making a wide turn. And once the people
were pulled over, they would search their cars for drugs or for other
contraband and essentially look for evidence of more serious offenses.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    I don’t care. I appreciate y’all being out here for “violent”
    crimes. My son is not a “violent” nothing.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    No one said he was a violent crime. No one said he was.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    He shouldn’t even be out of the car handcuffed right now.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Can you tell me — can you tell me how to pick out violent crimes?

rukmini callimachi

As a result, it created a lot of bad will between the city’s police
department and the city’s Black population. Black people who were just
going about their daily lives were getting pulled over and aggressively
searched when they were doing nothing more than, like the teenage boy in
the viral video, going to the store to get a slushie in his mom’s car.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    All right, sir, he’s your ID back. You’ve got court October 2 for
    improper turning at 7:00 p.m. \[INAUDIBLE\] Do you understand the
    reason why you’re stopped?
    
    All righty. Have a wonderful day.

rukmini callimachi

So it just so happened that the week that the video of the homecoming
king went viral, that week coincided with a visit to the department of a
policing expert named Robin Engel. She’s a professor at the University
of Cincinnati. And she has been promoting a different approach to
policing that has actually really been successful and borne fruit in a
couple of communities, including Cincinnati and Las Vegas. When the
video caused the uproar that it caused, the police chief pulled her
aside in a conference room and said to her, how can we do better?

michael barbaro

And what was her answer?

rukmini callimachi

Her answer was instead of flooding a large area with police, you go
hyper focused. And you look at a micro location that has been the locus
of repeat crime — a storefront, an abandoned warehouse, a city block, an
apartment building. And you ask yourself, what is it about that specific
location? What are the parameters of that location that are making it
conducive to repeat crime?

And then once you identify that place, you begin putting a lot of police
resources into monitoring that microlocation. And she told him about how
this method of policing had dramatically reduced violent crime as much
as 70 percent to 80 percent in one particular neighborhood in
Cincinnati. So when the police chief hears about this, he naturally got
excited.

And by December of last year, the police department had created its own
squad that was going to target crime through this new method. So the
next thing that happens is they identify the area of the city that has
the highest crime. And they end up honing in on a street called Elliot
Avenue, the 2400 block of Elliott Avenue — basically one city block.

So it was on this block that they erected a pole camera in January. What
they saw is that within an hour of erecting the camera on January 2,
between 15 and 20 cars had stopped in front of 2424 Eliott Avenue. 2424
Eliott Avenue was one of four trap houses, or drug houses, that were
being operated by Jamarcus Glover. And this is how Jamarcus basically
ends up in the crosshairs of this new squad that was created for the
purpose of reforming police conduct in the city.

That same day, this is January 2, in addition to seeing the 15 to 20
cars that stopped in front of this house — these are presumably
customers who are coming and going, buying drugs — they see between 5:00
and 6:00 p.m. that evening a Chevrolet Impala pull up. They run the
plates. And they learn that that car is registered to Breonna Taylor.

  - archived recording  
    Hello. This is a free call from —

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Hello

rukmini callimachi

The next day, the 3rd of January —

  - archived recording  
    — an inmate at Louisville Metropolitan Corrections Department.

rukmini callimachi

— Jamarcus Glover is arrested. And he makes a series of recorded phone
calls to Breonna Taylor from jail.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Hello.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\]

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    You been asleep?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I was asleep, I’m so sorry.

rukmini callimachi

In one of those recorded calls, you hear Jamarcus Glover asking her to
arrange his bail by contacting another associate of his.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    You say he was already back at the trap and then I talked to him
    again just a minute ago to see if he had contacted him. They
    couldn’t post bond till 1:00.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Yeah, I’m waiting now.

rukmini callimachi

And in these calls —

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Yeah. Mmm.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    \[MOANS\]

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I think I’m about to be sick. \[INAUDIBLE\] I feel like I got hit by
    a bus.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Well come give me some rest in your bed.

rukmini callimachi

You can sense the intimacy between them.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Jamarcus.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    What? You don’t want me \[INAUDIBLE\]?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I didn’t say that.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Ugh, need some rest. I haven’t had no rest. Like none.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Yeah I know. I haven’t really been sleeping for real either. I keep
    waking up every other hour type shit.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Yeah.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    When you’re around, I stress a lot.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Huh?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    When you’re around, I stress more. You know?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Why?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Well, because I just — I’ll always be worried about you.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Aw. Well, I love you. I’m going try to make sure this \[INAUDIBLE\]
    —

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    OK. I love you, too.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    I love you. And I’ll call you back and let you know.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    OK.

rukmini callimachi

So Jamarcus gets bailed out. And in the course of the next two months,
this newly created squad continues to surveil the trap house at the 2400
block of Elliott. They end up putting a G.P.S. on Jamarcus’ car. And
that G.P.S. shows that he makes repeated trips in January between the
trap house and Breonna Taylor’s apartment. They also send police to
watch her apartment.

And on one day in mid-January, they photograph Jamarcus going into her
apartment and emerging from it with a package in his hands, and then
driving straight back to the trap house. On another occasion in
February, they film her and him arriving in the same car at the trap
house. He is seen getting out of the driver’s side door.

She’s seen getting out of the passenger side door. He goes into the trap
house. He comes back out. And they drive away together. But the thing
that the police had missed as they were carrying out this intense
surveillance was the new arc of Breonna Taylor’s life that had been
building for some time.

  - preonia flakes  
    This is messages from January. It says: “This year I’m coming for
    everything.” She said, “I’m speaking it into existence.” And she
    sent two emojis with the fingers crossed and some hearts. She was
    coming for everything she wanted this year. 2020 was her year.

rukmini callimachi

After leaving her job as an E.M.T., she got back on her feet. And she
got a job as an emergency room technician. She picked up a second shift.
And she was now working basically two jobs at this E.R. and at another
hospital.

And you see that her life, according to her social media posts, is
really on this positive trajectory. She’s bought herself a new car.
She’s going to save up for a home. And crucially, in mid-February, she
appears to break up for good with Jamarcus Glover. And the reason I say
for good is there’s evidence that’s come out since then that indicates
that she actually blocked him on her cell phone.

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    These two here, they might as well get married.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Do you want to be my baby daddy?

  - archived recording (kenneth walker)  
    Yes.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Are we going to have fun, baby?

  - archived recording (kenneth walker)  
    Yes.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    When?

  - archived recording (kenneth walker)  
    Today.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Ooh.

  - archived recording (kenneth walker)  
    \[LAUGHTER\]

rukmini callimachi

And from what we know —

  - kenneth walker  
    Everything was, like, really good. It was great.

rukmini callimachi

— she seems to commit to Kenny.

  - kenneth walker  
    There was a whole lot of marriage talk and baby talk. We even had
    baby names and everything. Kenbre, just for the record, that was the
    girl name. That’s Kenny and Bre mixed. I liked that.

rukmini callimachi

So they’re very much launched on what looks to be a serious
relationship.

But even as these sweeping changes are occurring in Breonna Taylor’s
life, the police are barreling forward on their investigation.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

rukmini callimachi

And they believe by March that they have enough evidence to hit five
locations that are crucial to Jamarcus Glover’s criminal syndicate. Four
of them are on Elliott Avenue and around Elliott Avenue — these are the
trap houses that he operated. And the fifth is the home of Breonna
Taylor.

michael barbaro

Tomorrow on “The Daily”: What happened during the police raid?

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. The chief of police in
Rochester, New York resigned on Tuesday, amid growing outrage and
widening investigations into the death of Daniel Prude by officers in
his department. Prude suffocated after police placed a hood over his
head and pressed him into the ground for two minutes — a death that
Rochester officials did not disclose for months. The police chief,
La’Ron Singletary, has denied that the officers involved did anything
wrong.

And —

  - archived recording (albert bourla)  
    It is an unprecedented moment. It’s an historic pledge. Nine vaccine
    makers are coming out, saying that they will stand with science.

michael barbaro

— in an unusual public pledge, the C.E.O.s of nine drug companies,
including Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, said that they would not
distribute a vaccine for the coronavirus until it had been thoroughly
vetted for safety and effectiveness.

  - archived recording (albert bourla)  
    With increasing public concerns about the processes that we are
    using to develop these vaccines, and even more importantly, the
    processes that will be used to evaluate these vaccines, we saw it as
    critical to come out and reiterate our commitment that we will
    develop our products our vaccines, using the highest ethical
    standards.

michael barbaro

The statement appeared to be a response to claims by President Trump
that a vaccine would be ready before Election Day, raising fears that
the president may rush the process and undermine public trust in an
eventual vaccine.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you
tomorrow.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    I got him. What’s going on, man?

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    What’s up?

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    You know what I’m stopping you for?

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    I don’t.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Man, when you turned on here, onto Dixie —

rukmini callimachi

In the spring of 2019, this video started circulating online.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Do me a favor. Put your hands on the steering wheel.

rukmini callimachi

It showed the police in the city of Louisville in Kentucky making a
traffic stop.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    I got him.

rukmini callimachi

The driver was a Black teenage boy.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Do you want to hop out?

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    Get out of the car.

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    They telling me to get out of the car now.

rukmini callimachi

He happened to be his high school’s homecoming king and a multiple
scholarship winner.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    You don’t have any weapons on you, do you?

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    I don’t.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    No drugs?

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    No.

michael barbaro

He had borrowed his mom’s car to go buy a slushie at the local store.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Turn around. Put your hands on the car for me. Spread your feet.

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    I don’t have — but I haven’t did anything.

michael barbaro

And he suddenly found himself being pulled out of the car —

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Put your hands around your back real quick.

rukmini callimachi

— being handcuffed.

  - archived recording  
    \[INTERPOSING VOICES\]

rukmini callimachi

Being searched.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Quit doing the clutching your fist thing too.

rukmini callimachi

For the offense of making a wide turn.

And this video that went viral online was far from the first time that
something like this had happened in Louisville.

  - archived recording  
    There’s a call now for a review of Metro police policies, claims of
    racial profiling on the part of the white police officer who —

rukmini callimachi

So in response, the Louisville Police Department enacted a series of
reforms.

  - archived recording  
    These changes are meant to reflect our department’s values and
    commitment to fair, professional interactions with the public. We
    have work to do in terms of building trust and legitimacy with the
    people that we have sworn to serve and protect.

rukmini callimachi

And yet, those very reforms set into motion a raid that a few months
later killed a 26-year-old woman.

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    We want justice\!

  - archived recording (crowd)

But unlike George Floyd, Eric Garner or Rayshard Brooks, there’s no
video capturing the final moments of her life.

  - archived recording (cardi b)  
    Do you know Breonna Taylor’s story, her whole story?

michael barbaro

Today: A Times investigation pieces together what actually happened to
Breonna Taylor. In part one, Rukmini Callimachi tells the story of how
police ended up at her door. It’s Wednesday, September 9.

  - rukmini callimachi  
    All right, let’s get started. OK?

  - archived recording  
    Mhm.

michael barbaro

Rukmini, where does your reporting start for this story?

rukmini callimachi

So I met my colleague, the documentary filmmaker, Yoruba Richen, in
Louisville.

  - yoruba richen  
    So can you start off by telling me your names and what your relation
    is to Breonna?

rukmini callimachi

And we spent the next couple of weeks speaking to the people who knew
Breonna best.

  - tamika palmer  
    My name’s Tamika Palmer. I have two daughters.

rukmini callimachi

Her mom.

  - tamika palmer  
    Breonna Taylor, Ju’Niyah Palmer.

  - kenneth walker  
    My name is Kenneth Walker.

rukmini callimachi

Her boyfriend.

  - preonia flakes  
    My name is Preonia Flakes. And I am Breonna’s cousin.

rukmini callimachi

Her cousins.

  - preonia flakes  
    I would say our relationship was more like sisters, twin cousins.
    Pre and Bre.

rukmini callimachi

Her very best friends going all the way back to her childhood. Her
co-workers. And in combination with the thousands of pages of documents
that I was able to acquire about her case, what comes across is that
this is a young woman who was dealt, I would say a pretty tough hand in
life.

  - yoruba richen  
    What was your reaction when you find out you were pregnant? How old
    were you?

  - tamika palmer  
    \[LAUGHS\] I was, like, in disbelief. I was 16 years old though. So
    —

rukmini callimachi

She was born to a teenage mom.

  - tamika palmer  
    I just knew I had to be a better person then, at that point. So I
    took it on.

rukmini callimachi

Her dad was convicted on a murder and drug charge when she was just six
years old and was sent to prison for the rest of her life.

  - yoruba richen  
    What was she like as a child?

  - tamika palmer  
    Breonna was a good kid. She was easy, even just as a young kid. She
    just was — she was smart.

rukmini callimachi

But what you also see amidst the challenges of her early life is a
person who was trying to push beyond the limitations of her
circumstances.

  - tamika palmer  
    She was one of those people, she made a plan, and she went. That was
    it. Like, it has to be done this way. And, like, OK.

  - preonia flakes  
    Just seeing how she was wanting to be successful, she kind of, like,
    drove that into my head. Like, this is what we’re going to do. This
    is how you’re going to do it. And I’m going to show you how to do
    it.

rukmini callimachi

We spoke to one of her oldest friends who said that her mom, when they
were children, would not let her go to sleepovers at all, except if the
sleepover was at Breonna’s house. Why? Because Breonna was considered
the responsible one. She was the one among their little group of friends
who made sure that the other girls got to school on time if there was a
sleepover, who made sure that they did their homework. She seemed to be
taking almost an adult role in her immediate circle.

  - tamika palmer  
    Even as a kid, I can remember her being 7 years old, saying to my
    mother, let me check your blood sugar.

rukmini callimachi

When she was very young, she started to show an interest in medicine,
and in health care and in helping other people. Her mom describes how,
when Breonna learned that her grandmother had an insulin problem, she
wanted to prick her grandmother’s finger with a needle and draw blood so
that she could test her blood sugar level. She thought that that was
interesting. And she kept on asking her grandmother if she could do
that.

  - tamika palmer  
    Like, leave her alone\! But she — my mother would let her stick her
    finger in. And she was so pumped up to do it. And helped her do her
    insulin. I’m like, oh, my God.

rukmini callimachi

We see that in ninth grade, she begged her mom to give her permission to
take the bus and to go start working at a local fast food joint after
school. Her friends say that they never really knew her without a job.

  - preonia flakes  
    She taught me stuff my own people, my own siblings, my own mother
    didn’t teach me. The family I came from, really not supportive. So I
    used to make little Facebook statuses like, who’s going to come to
    my graduation if I had it, even though I know y’all don’t really
    mess with me? Bre would be, like, don’t worry about them. And as
    long as I’m by your side, that’s all that matters. Because I’m a
    leader.

rukmini callimachi

Breonna is the first person in her family to graduate from high school.
And she then goes to college.

  - yoruba richen  
    Tell me how you met?

  - kenneth walker  
    We met, I guess on Twitter.

rukmini callimachi

In college, she starts a banter on Twitter with another college student.

  - kenneth walker  
    Kind of like, flirting on the timeline, I guess, so to say.

rukmini callimachi

His name was Kenneth Walker. He went by Kenny to all of his friends.

  - kenneth walker  
    And she went to University of Kentucky. And I went to Western
    Kentucky.

rukmini callimachi

And they start a sort of emoji-filled, flirtatious Twitter banter that,
by 2016, evolved into the beginnings of a romance and of a relationship.

  - kenneth walker  
    I kept on telling her I don’t want to be friends no more. But we can
    be if we have to be. But I don’t want to be.

rukmini callimachi

It was an on again, off again relationship. But what’s clear in this
back and forth is that Kenny seemed to really have identified her as the
person that he wanted to be his life partner.

  - kenneth walker  
    Seems like when nobody else was there for me, she was always there.

rukmini callimachi

And it was Breonna that wasn’t 100 percent sure about him.

  - kenneth walker  
    Some days it was, yeah, let’s marry and have a kid. And then other
    days, like, no, let’s be single and live kid-free lives. So there
    was a million time when I’d say I’m not messing with her anymore
    ever again. And I’m sure she said the same thing several times.

rukmini callimachi

But everybody we spoke to described him as somebody who genuinely loved
her.

  - kenneth walker  
    We can be friends. And we can be everything else, too. That’s the
    goal when you trying to be with somebody or love them, whatever. You
    want to be friends with them also. And that’s rare. So if you come
    across that, I think you should try to take advantage of it.

rukmini callimachi

What we now know is that a few months after she started dating Kenny in
2016, she also starts seeing another man. His name is Jamarcus Glover.
And by all accounts, he’s, in many ways, the opposite of Kenny.

Jamarcus is a twice convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced in 2008 when
he was 18 years old in Mississippi, his home state, for drug
trafficking. And later in 2014, he moves to Kentucky. He’s charged again
for drug possession. And he would spend the next several years in and
out of jail.

And it bears noting that he seems to enter her life at what was
ostensibly a low point. She had started college. But she dropped out
because she felt homesick and was really missing her family. She got her
E.M.T. certification and began working as a first responder, riding
ambulances. But a year into that job, she quit. On social media, she
says that she was discouraged by the 16-hour shifts and by the low pay.
And pretty soon into her relationship with Jamarcus, his problems become
her problems.

    Yes.

And they came because of a favor that she had done for him.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    OK. So what’s your name, young man?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Jamarcus.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Glover.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Glover?

rukmini callimachi

So what happened is she had rented a car. Her own car was apparently in
the shop. So she had rented a car from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. And
Jamarcus Glover asked her for the keys. She handed over the keys. He
then handed them to a third person, a man. And a couple of hours later,
that person was found dead, slumped over the wheel of the car. His body
was riddled with bullets. And on the floorboard of the car and in the
console, they found several baggies of drugs.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    What I need to know is what’s going on with the rental car and the
    person that was in the car.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I don’t know who was in the car.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    She let me use the car.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    — back at home, and that’s all I know.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Mhm.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    That’s all I know.

rukmini callimachi

The person that ends up dead at the wheel of the car is a man that’s
known to them only by his nickname Rambo. And in fact, he’s the brother
of one of Jamarcus Glover’s associates, a member of what turns out to be
a criminal drug syndicate. And that man had gone to jail on multiple
occasions with Jamarcus.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Are you all into the game?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Oh, no.

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    I mean, come on now.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Well I mean, I roll with them. \[INAUDIBLE\]

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    And let’s just be honest right here, OK?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    I roll with them. But they ain’t got nothing to do with a gang. They
    —

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    I’m not saying gang. I said the game. Are you working? How did he
    make his money? How do you make your money?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Oh, no, no. Ain’t — hell, no. \[INAUDIBLE\]

  - archived recording (officer 1)  
    Are you working now?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    No.

  - archived recording (officer 2)

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I don’t work right now. I just left my job over the weekend.

  - archived recording (officer 2)

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)

rukmini callimachi

I saw the police notes. And they concluded that Breonna really had no
foreknowledge of how this car was going to be used. And that Jamarcus
also did not appear to be aware that this man was going to get killed.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

Rukmini, when you talked to Breonna’s family and her friends, did
Jamarcus come up? And what did they say about him?

rukmini callimachi

You know, this was really hard to get at. Because when we spoke to her
mother, her cousins, her best friends, you ask about Jamarcus Glover and
either they stopped making eye contact with you, or they say to you that
they don’t want to talk about him. Or they say to you that they don’t
know him. And this relationship is something that we have essentially
uncovered through documents.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

rukmini callimachi

This was clearly something that those who love her did not want to talk
about. The closest I got was one of her oldest childhood friends,
somebody who’s known her since she was in elementary school. And all she
would say to me was, I didn’t like him — regarding Jamarcus.

But what we see in the documents that we’ve amassed is that in the next
four years, she was on again and off again with Kenny and with Jamarcus.
And in the periods that she’s with Jamarcus, he repeatedly entangles her
in his problems and in his run-ins and dealings with police. This is a
man who is in and out of jail. And he asks her to pay his bail twice in
2017.

And then later, in 2019, you see her paying bail for another man,
another accused drug dealer who was a friend of Jamarcus’s, and who was
believed to be part of this criminal syndicate alongside him.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Are you saying something about work?

rukmini callimachi

That same year, 2019 —

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Do me a favor. Put your hands on the steering wheel.

rukmini callimachi

— that’s the year that the video of the homecoming king getting pulled
over by Louisville police goes viral.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Now do me a favor. Grab your phone and your wallet and stick it on
    the seat.

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    Why?

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Because I’m telling you. Or it’s going to fall out when you get out
    of the vehicle.

rukmini callimachi

And when he gets pulled over for the infraction of making a wide turn,
things very quickly escalate.

He’s pulled out of his car by the white police officer.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Yeah. We’re allowed to pat you down copper for a wide turn.

  - archived recording (black teenager)  
    Mama, they patting me down\!

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Yep. We’re allowed to do that.

rukmini callimachi

He’s on the phone with his mom. And the cops begin searching his car for
drugs.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    — and stay over here, please. Ma’am, please stay over here.

rukmini callimachi

His mom eventually shows up.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Stay over there, please. If you approach my traffic stop, I will
    take you.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    He’s my son.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Ma’am, if you approach my traffic stop, I will take you to jail. I
    don’t care\!

rukmini callimachi

And in the conversation that ensues, another officer begins to explain
to the mom the larger strategy of what they’re trying to do with these
traffic stops.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    What I’m saying is, if it’s a wrong turn, give him a ticket. You
    don’t have to bring —

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    That’s not what we’re out here for. OK?

  - archived recording (mother)  
    What are you out here for? That’s what he said.

  - archived recording  
    We’re a violent — we’re a violent crimes unit. First, we’re not
    narcotics. OK.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    But what do you mean violent?

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    So listen. Just — will you listen to me? Because I want to explain —

rukmini callimachi

What they would do is they would identify an area that had a high crime
rate. And then they would flood that area with police officers who would
pull people over for minor offenses — for turning without signaling, for
having a broken tail light, for making a wide turn. And once the people
were pulled over, they would search their cars for drugs or for other
contraband and essentially look for evidence of more serious offenses.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    I don’t care. I appreciate y’all being out here for “violent”
    crimes. My son is not a “violent” nothing.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    No one said he was a violent crime. No one said he was.

  - archived recording (mother)  
    He shouldn’t even be out of the car handcuffed right now.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    Can you tell me — can you tell me how to pick out violent crimes?

rukmini callimachi

As a result, it created a lot of bad will between the city’s police
department and the city’s Black population. Black people who were just
going about their daily lives were getting pulled over and aggressively
searched when they were doing nothing more than, like the teenage boy in
the viral video, going to the store to get a slushie in his mom’s car.

  - archived recording (police officer)  
    All right, sir, he’s your ID back. You’ve got court October 2 for
    improper turning at 7:00 p.m. \[INAUDIBLE\] Do you understand the
    reason why you’re stopped?
    
    All righty. Have a wonderful day.

rukmini callimachi

So it just so happened that the week that the video of the homecoming
king went viral, that week coincided with a visit to the department of a
policing expert named Robin Engel. She’s a professor at the University
of Cincinnati. And she has been promoting a different approach to
policing that has actually really been successful and borne fruit in a
couple of communities, including Cincinnati and Las Vegas. When the
video caused the uproar that it caused, the police chief pulled her
aside in a conference room and said to her, how can we do better?

michael barbaro

And what was her answer?

rukmini callimachi

Her answer was instead of flooding a large area with police, you go
hyper focused. And you look at a micro location that has been the locus
of repeat crime — a storefront, an abandoned warehouse, a city block, an
apartment building. And you ask yourself, what is it about that specific
location? What are the parameters of that location that are making it
conducive to repeat crime?

And then once you identify that place, you begin putting a lot of police
resources into monitoring that microlocation. And she told him about how
this method of policing had dramatically reduced violent crime as much
as 70 percent to 80 percent in one particular neighborhood in
Cincinnati. So when the police chief hears about this, he naturally got
excited.

And by December of last year, the police department had created its own
squad that was going to target crime through this new method. So the
next thing that happens is they identify the area of the city that has
the highest crime. And they end up honing in on a street called Elliot
Avenue, the 2400 block of Elliott Avenue — basically one city block.

So it was on this block that they erected a pole camera in January. What
they saw is that within an hour of erecting the camera on January 2,
between 15 and 20 cars had stopped in front of 2424 Eliott Avenue. 2424
Eliott Avenue was one of four trap houses, or drug houses, that were
being operated by Jamarcus Glover. And this is how Jamarcus basically
ends up in the crosshairs of this new squad that was created for the
purpose of reforming police conduct in the city.

That same day, this is January 2, in addition to seeing the 15 to 20
cars that stopped in front of this house — these are presumably
customers who are coming and going, buying drugs — they see between 5:00
and 6:00 p.m. that evening a Chevrolet Impala pull up. They run the
plates. And they learn that that car is registered to Breonna Taylor.

  - archived recording  
    Hello. This is a free call from —

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Hello

rukmini callimachi

The next day, the 3rd of January —

  - archived recording  
    — an inmate at Louisville Metropolitan Corrections Department.

rukmini callimachi

— Jamarcus Glover is arrested. And he makes a series of recorded phone
calls to Breonna Taylor from jail.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Hello.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    \[INAUDIBLE\]

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    You been asleep?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I was asleep, I’m so sorry.

rukmini callimachi

In one of those recorded calls, you hear Jamarcus Glover asking her to
arrange his bail by contacting another associate of his.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    You say he was already back at the trap and then I talked to him
    again just a minute ago to see if he had contacted him. They
    couldn’t post bond till 1:00.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Yeah, I’m waiting now.

rukmini callimachi

And in these calls —

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Yeah. Mmm.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    \[MOANS\]

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I think I’m about to be sick. \[INAUDIBLE\] I feel like I got hit by
    a bus.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Well come give me some rest in your bed.

rukmini callimachi

You can sense the intimacy between them.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Jamarcus.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    What? You don’t want me \[INAUDIBLE\]?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    I didn’t say that.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Ugh, need some rest. I haven’t had no rest. Like none.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Yeah I know. I haven’t really been sleeping for real either. I keep
    waking up every other hour type shit.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Yeah.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    When you’re around, I stress a lot.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Huh?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    When you’re around, I stress more. You know?

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Why?

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Well, because I just — I’ll always be worried about you.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    Aw. Well, I love you. I’m going try to make sure this \[INAUDIBLE\]
    —

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    OK. I love you, too.

  - archived recording (jamarcus glover)  
    I love you. And I’ll call you back and let you know.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    OK.

rukmini callimachi

So Jamarcus gets bailed out. And in the course of the next two months,
this newly created squad continues to surveil the trap house at the 2400
block of Elliott. They end up putting a G.P.S. on Jamarcus’ car. And
that G.P.S. shows that he makes repeated trips in January between the
trap house and Breonna Taylor’s apartment. They also send police to
watch her apartment.

And on one day in mid-January, they photograph Jamarcus going into her
apartment and emerging from it with a package in his hands, and then
driving straight back to the trap house. On another occasion in
February, they film her and him arriving in the same car at the trap
house. He is seen getting out of the driver’s side door.

She’s seen getting out of the passenger side door. He goes into the trap
house. He comes back out. And they drive away together. But the thing
that the police had missed as they were carrying out this intense
surveillance was the new arc of Breonna Taylor’s life that had been
building for some time.

  - preonia flakes  
    This is messages from January. It says: “This year I’m coming for
    everything.” She said, “I’m speaking it into existence.” And she
    sent two emojis with the fingers crossed and some hearts. She was
    coming for everything she wanted this year. 2020 was her year.

rukmini callimachi

After leaving her job as an E.M.T., she got back on her feet. And she
got a job as an emergency room technician. She picked up a second shift.
And she was now working basically two jobs at this E.R. and at another
hospital.

And you see that her life, according to her social media posts, is
really on this positive trajectory. She’s bought herself a new car.
She’s going to save up for a home. And crucially, in mid-February, she
appears to break up for good with Jamarcus Glover. And the reason I say
for good is there’s evidence that’s come out since then that indicates
that she actually blocked him on her cell phone.

  - archived recording (speaker)  
    These two here, they might as well get married.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Do you want to be my baby daddy?

  - archived recording (kenneth walker)  
    Yes.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Are we going to have fun, baby?

  - archived recording (kenneth walker)  
    Yes.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    When?

  - archived recording (kenneth walker)  
    Today.

  - archived recording (breonna taylor)  
    Ooh.

  - archived recording (kenneth walker)  
    \[LAUGHTER\]

rukmini callimachi

And from what we know —

  - kenneth walker  
    Everything was, like, really good. It was great.

rukmini callimachi

— she seems to commit to Kenny.

  - kenneth walker  
    There was a whole lot of marriage talk and baby talk. We even had
    baby names and everything. Kenbre, just for the record, that was the
    girl name. That’s Kenny and Bre mixed. I liked that.

rukmini callimachi

So they’re very much launched on what looks to be a serious
relationship.

But even as these sweeping changes are occurring in Breonna Taylor’s
life, the police are barreling forward on their investigation.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

rukmini callimachi

And they believe by March that they have enough evidence to hit five
locations that are crucial to Jamarcus Glover’s criminal syndicate. Four
of them are on Elliott Avenue and around Elliott Avenue — these are the
trap houses that he operated. And the fifth is the home of Breonna
Taylor.

michael barbaro

Tomorrow on “The Daily”: What happened during the police raid?

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to know today. The chief of police in
Rochester, New York resigned on Tuesday, amid growing outrage and
widening investigations into the death of Daniel Prude by officers in
his department. Prude suffocated after police placed a hood over his
head and pressed him into the ground for two minutes — a death that
Rochester officials did not disclose for months. The police chief,
La’Ron Singletary, has denied that the officers involved did anything
wrong.

And —

  - archived recording (albert bourla)  
    It is an unprecedented moment. It’s an historic pledge. Nine vaccine
    makers are coming out, saying that they will stand with science.

michael barbaro

— in an unusual public pledge, the C.E.O.s of nine drug companies,
including Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, said that they would not
distribute a vaccine for the coronavirus until it had been thoroughly
vetted for safety and effectiveness.

  - archived recording (albert bourla)  
    With increasing public concerns about the processes that we are
    using to develop these vaccines, and even more importantly, the
    processes that will be used to evaluate these vaccines, we saw it as
    critical to come out and reiterate our commitment that we will
    develop our products our vaccines, using the highest ethical
    standards.

michael barbaro

The statement appeared to be a response to claims by President Trump
that a vaccine would be ready before Election Day, raising fears that
the president may rush the process and undermine public trust in an
eventual vaccine.

That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

When asked about Breonna Taylor, her loved ones paint a picture of a
determined, responsible young woman: “One of those people she made a
plan and she went — that was it.”

As part of an investigation for The New York Times, our correspondent
Rukmini Callimachi and the documentary filmmaker Yoruba Richen spent
weeks interviewing those who were closest to Ms. Taylor, who was killed
in her home by the police in Louisville, Ky., in March. She was 26.

“She taught me stuff my own people, my own siblings, my own mother
didn’t teach me,” Preonia Flakes, Ms. Taylor’s cousin, told Rukmini
and Yoruba.

Kenneth Walker, Ms. Taylor’s boyfriend, said: “She was just so kind and
loving and caring.”

The first of her family to graduate from high school, with an interest
in medicine and health care, she emerged from the discussions as someone
who, despite being dealt a tough hand in life, was determined to push
beyond the limitations of her
circumstance.

At the beginning of 2020, Ms. Taylor posted on social media that it was
going to be her year. After an apparent low point, her life was
changing: She was planning a family with Mr. Walker, she had a new job
and a new car. She had also blocked Jamarcus Glover, a convicted drug
dealer with whom she had **** been romantically involved on and off
since 2016, from her phone.

But forces were already in motion. The Louisville Police Department was
preparing raids on locations it had linked to Mr. Glover — and Ms.
Taylor’s address was on the target list.
