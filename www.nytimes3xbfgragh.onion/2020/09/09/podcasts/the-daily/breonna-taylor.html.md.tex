For the offense of making a wide turn.

And this video that went viral online was far from the first time that
something like this had happened in Louisville.

\begin{itemize}

\item

  There's a call now for a review of Metro police policies, claims of
  racial profiling on the part of the white police officer who ---
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

So in response, the Louisville Police Department enacted a series of
reforms.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

  These changes are meant to reflect our department's values and
  commitment to fair, professional interactions with the public. We have
  work to do in terms of building trust and legitimacy with the people
  that we have sworn to serve and protect.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And yet, those very reforms set into motion a raid that a few months
later killed a 26-year-old woman.

Today: A Times investigation pieces together what actually happened to
Breonna Taylor. In part one, Rukmini Callimachi tells the story of how
police ended up at her door. It's Wednesday, September 9.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  rukmini callimachi\\
  All right, let's get started. OK?
\item
  archived recording\\
  Mhm.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

Rukmini, where does your reporting start for this story?

rukmini callimachi

So I met my colleague, the documentary filmmaker, Yoruba Richen, in
Louisville.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  yoruba richen\\
  So can you start off by telling me your names and what your relation
  is to Breonna?
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And we spent the next couple of weeks speaking to the people who knew
Breonna best.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  My name's Tamika Palmer. I have two daughters.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

Her mom.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  Breonna Taylor, Ju'Niyah Palmer.
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  My name is Kenneth Walker.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

Her boyfriend.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  preonia flakes\\
  My name is Preonia Flakes. And I am Breonna's cousin.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

Her cousins.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  preonia flakes\\
  I would say our relationship was more like sisters, twin cousins. Pre
  and Bre.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

Her very best friends going all the way back to her childhood. Her
co-workers. And in combination with the thousands of pages of documents
that I was able to acquire about her case, what comes across is that
this is a young woman who was dealt, I would say a pretty tough hand in
life.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  yoruba richen\\
  What was your reaction when you find out you were pregnant? How old
  were you?
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} I was, like, in disbelief. I was 16 years old though. So
  ---
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

She was born to a teenage mom.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  I just knew I had to be a better person then, at that point. So I took
  it on.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

Her dad was convicted on a murder and drug charge when she was just six
years old and was sent to prison for the rest of her life.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  yoruba richen\\
  What was she like as a child?
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  Breonna was a good kid. She was easy, even just as a young kid. She
  just was --- she was smart.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

But what you also see amidst the challenges of her early life is a
person who was trying to push beyond the limitations of her
circumstances.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  She was one of those people, she made a plan, and she went. That was
  it. Like, it has to be done this way. And, like, OK.
\item
  preonia flakes\\
  Just seeing how she was wanting to be successful, she kind of, like,
  drove that into my head. Like, this is what we're going to do. This is
  how you're going to do it. And I'm going to show you how to do it.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

We spoke to one of her oldest friends who said that her mom, when they
were children, would not let her go to sleepovers at all, except if the
sleepover was at Breonna's house. Why? Because Breonna was considered
the responsible one. She was the one among their little group of friends
who made sure that the other girls got to school on time if there was a
sleepover, who made sure that they did their homework. She seemed to be
taking almost an adult role in her immediate circle.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  Even as a kid, I can remember her being 7 years old, saying to my
  mother, let me check your blood sugar.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

When she was very young, she started to show an interest in medicine,
and in health care and in helping other people. Her mom describes how,
when Breonna learned that her grandmother had an insulin problem, she
wanted to prick her grandmother's finger with a needle and draw blood so
that she could test her blood sugar level. She thought that that was
interesting. And she kept on asking her grandmother if she could do
that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  Like, leave her alone! But she --- my mother would let her stick her
  finger in. And she was so pumped up to do it. And helped her do her
  insulin. I'm like, oh, my God.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

We see that in ninth grade, she begged her mom to give her permission to
take the bus and to go start working at a local fast food joint after
school. Her friends say that they never really knew her without a job.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  preonia flakes\\
  She taught me stuff my own people, my own siblings, my own mother
  didn't teach me. The family I came from, really not supportive. So I
  used to make little Facebook statuses like, who's going to come to my
  graduation if I had it, even though I know y'all don't really mess
  with me? Bre would be, like, don't worry about them. And as long as
  I'm by your side, that's all that matters. Because I'm a leader.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

Breonna is the first person in her family to graduate from high school.
And she then goes to college.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  yoruba richen\\
  Tell me how you met?
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  We met, I guess on Twitter.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

In college, she starts a banter on Twitter with another college student.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  Kind of like, flirting on the timeline, I guess, so to say.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

His name was Kenneth Walker. He went by Kenny to all of his friends.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  And she went to University of Kentucky. And I went to Western
  Kentucky.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And they start a sort of emoji-filled, flirtatious Twitter banter that,
by 2016, evolved into the beginnings of a romance and of a relationship.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  I kept on telling her I don't want to be friends no more. But we can
  be if we have to be. But I don't want to be.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

It was an on again, off again relationship. But what's clear in this
back and forth is that Kenny seemed to really have identified her as the
person that he wanted to be his life partner.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  Seems like when nobody else was there for me, she was always there.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And it was Breonna that wasn't 100 percent sure about him.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  Some days it was, yeah, let's marry and have a kid. And then other
  days, like, no, let's be single and live kid-free lives. So there was
  a million time when I'd say I'm not messing with her anymore ever
  again. And I'm sure she said the same thing several times.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

But everybody we spoke to described him as somebody who genuinely loved
her.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  We can be friends. And we can be everything else, too. That's the goal
  when you trying to be with somebody or love them, whatever. You want
  to be friends with them also. And that's rare. So if you come across
  that, I think you should try to take advantage of it.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

What we now know is that a few months after she started dating Kenny in
2016, she also starts seeing another man. His name is Jamarcus Glover.
And by all accounts, he's, in many ways, the opposite of Kenny.

Jamarcus is a twice convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced in 2008 when
he was 18 years old in Mississippi, his home state, for drug
trafficking. And later in 2014, he moves to Kentucky. He's charged again
for drug possession. And he would spend the next several years in and
out of jail.

And it bears noting that he seems to enter her life at what was
ostensibly a low point. She had started college. But she dropped out
because she felt homesick and was really missing her family. She got her
E.M.T. certification and began working as a first responder, riding
ambulances. But a year into that job, she quit. On social media, she
says that she was discouraged by the 16-hour shifts and by the low pay.
And pretty soon into her relationship with Jamarcus, his problems become
her problems.

And they came because of a favor that she had done for him.

\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

So what happened is she had rented a car. Her own car was apparently in
the shop. So she had rented a car from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. And
Jamarcus Glover asked her for the keys. She handed over the keys. He
then handed them to a third person, a man. And a couple of hours later,
that person was found dead, slumped over the wheel of the car. His body
was riddled with bullets. And on the floorboard of the car and in the
console, they found several baggies of drugs.

\begin{itemize}
\item

\item

\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

The person that ends up dead at the wheel of the car is a man that's
known to them only by his nickname Rambo. And in fact, he's the brother
of one of Jamarcus Glover's associates, a member of what turns out to be
a criminal drug syndicate. And that man had gone to jail on multiple
occasions with Jamarcus.

\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

I saw the police notes. And they concluded that Breonna really had no
foreknowledge of how this car was going to be used. And that Jamarcus
also did not appear to be aware that this man was going to get killed.

\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

Rukmini, when you talked to Breonna's family and her friends, did
Jamarcus come up? And what did they say about him?

rukmini callimachi

You know, this was really hard to get at. Because when we spoke to her
mother, her cousins, her best friends, you ask about Jamarcus Glover and
either they stopped making eye contact with you, or they say to you that
they don't want to talk about him. Or they say to you that they don't
know him. And this relationship is something that we have essentially
uncovered through documents.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

rukmini callimachi

This was clearly something that those who love her did not want to talk
about. The closest I got was one of her oldest childhood friends,
somebody who's known her since she was in elementary school. And all she
would say to me was, I didn't like him --- regarding Jamarcus.

But what we see in the documents that we've amassed is that in the next
four years, she was on again and off again with Kenny and with Jamarcus.
And in the periods that she's with Jamarcus, he repeatedly entangles her
in his problems and in his run-ins and dealings with police. This is a
man who is in and out of jail. And he asks her to pay his bail twice in
2017.

And then later, in 2019, you see her paying bail for another man,
another accused drug dealer who was a friend of Jamarcus's, and who was
believed to be part of this criminal syndicate alongside him.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  Are you saying something about work?
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

That same year, 2019 ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  Do me a favor. Put your hands on the steering wheel.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

--- that's the year that the video of the homecoming king getting pulled
over by Louisville police goes viral.

\begin{itemize}
\item

  Now do me a favor. Grab your phone and your wallet and stick it on the

\item

  Why?
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  Because I'm telling you. Or it's going to fall out when you get out of
  the vehicle.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And when he gets pulled over for the infraction of making a wide turn,
things very quickly escalate.

He's pulled out of his car by the white police officer.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  Yeah. We're allowed to pat you down copper for a wide turn.

And in the conversation that ensues, another officer begins to explain
to the mom the larger strategy of what they're trying to do with these
traffic stops.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (mother)\\
  What I'm saying is, if it's a wrong turn, give him a ticket. You don't
  have to bring ---
\item

  That's not what we're out here for. OK?
\item

  We're a violent --- we're a violent crimes unit. First, we're not
  narcotics. OK.
\item
  archived recording (mother)\\
  But what do you mean violent?
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  So listen. Just --- will you listen to me? Because I want to explain
  ---
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

What they would do is they would identify an area that had a high crime
rate. And then they would flood that area with police officers who would
pull people over for minor offenses --- for turning without signaling,
for having a broken tail light, for making a wide turn. And once the
people were pulled over, they would search their cars for drugs or for
other contraband and essentially look for evidence of more serious
offenses.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (mother)\\
  I don't care. I appreciate y'all being out here for ``violent''
  crimes. My son is not a ``violent'' nothing.
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  No one said he was a violent crime. No one said he was.
\item
  archived recording (mother)\\
  He shouldn't even be out of the car handcuffed right now.
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  Can you tell me --- can you tell me how to pick out violent crimes?
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

As a result, it created a lot of bad will between the city's police
department and the city's Black population. Black people who were just
going about their daily lives were getting pulled over and aggressively
searched when they were doing nothing more than, like the teenage boy in
the viral video, going to the store to get a slushie in his mom's car.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  All right, sir, he's your ID back. You've got court October 2 for
  improper turning at 7:00 p.m. {[}INAUDIBLE{]} Do you understand the
  reason why you're stopped?

  All righty. Have a wonderful day.
\end{itemize}

So it just so happened that the week that the video of the homecoming
king went viral, that week coincided with a visit to the department of a
policing expert named Robin Engel. She's a professor at the University
of Cincinnati. And she has been promoting a different approach to
policing that has actually really been successful and borne fruit in a
couple of communities, including Cincinnati and Las Vegas. When the
video caused the uproar that it caused, the police chief pulled her
aside in a conference room and said to her, how can we do better?

michael barbaro

And what was her answer?

rukmini callimachi

Her answer was instead of flooding a large area with police, you go
hyper focused. And you look at a micro location that has been the locus
of repeat crime --- a storefront, an abandoned warehouse, a city block,
an apartment building. And you ask yourself, what is it about that
specific location? What are the parameters of that location that are
making it conducive to repeat crime?

And then once you identify that place, you begin putting a lot of police
resources into monitoring that microlocation. And she told him about how
this method of policing had dramatically reduced violent crime as much
as 70 percent to 80 percent in one particular neighborhood in
Cincinnati. So when the police chief hears about this, he naturally got
excited.

And by December of last year, the police department had created its own
squad that was going to target crime through this new method. So the
next thing that happens is they identify the area of the city that has
the highest crime. And they end up honing in on a street called Elliot
Avenue, the 2400 block of Elliott Avenue --- basically one city block.

So it was on this block that they erected a pole camera in January. What
they saw is that within an hour of erecting the camera on January 2,
between 15 and 20 cars had stopped in front of 2424 Eliott Avenue. 2424
Eliott Avenue was one of four trap houses, or drug houses, that were
being operated by Jamarcus Glover. And this is how Jamarcus basically
ends up in the crosshairs of this new squad that was created for the
purpose of reforming police conduct in the city.

That same day, this is January 2, in addition to seeing the 15 to 20
cars that stopped in front of this house --- these are presumably
customers who are coming and going, buying drugs --- they see between
5:00 and 6:00 p.m. that evening a Chevrolet Impala pull up. They run the
plates. And they learn that that car is registered to Breonna Taylor.

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

--- Jamarcus Glover is arrested. And he makes a series of recorded phone
calls to Breonna Taylor from jail.

arrange his bail by contacting another associate of his.

\begin{itemize}
\item

\item
  archived recording (jamarcus glover)\\
  I love you. And I'll call you back and let you know.
\item
  archived recording (breonna taylor)\\
  OK.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

So Jamarcus gets bailed out. And in the course of the next two months,
this newly created squad continues to surveil the trap house at the 2400
block of Elliott. They end up putting a G.P.S. on Jamarcus' car. And
that G.P.S. shows that he makes repeated trips in January between the
trap house and Breonna Taylor's apartment. They also send police to
watch her apartment.

And on one day in mid-January, they photograph Jamarcus going into her
apartment and emerging from it with a package in his hands, and then
driving straight back to the trap house. On another occasion in
February, they film her and him arriving in the same car at the trap
house. He is seen getting out of the driver's side door.

She's seen getting out of the passenger side door. He goes into the trap
house. He comes back out. And they drive away together. But the thing
that the police had missed as they were carrying out this intense
surveillance was the new arc of Breonna Taylor's life that had been
building for some time.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  preonia flakes\\
  This is messages from January. It says: ``This year I'm coming for
  everything.'' She said, ``I'm speaking it into existence.'' And she
  sent two emojis with the fingers crossed and some hearts. She was
  coming for everything she wanted this year. 2020 was her year.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

After leaving her job as an E.M.T., she got back on her feet. And she
got a job as an emergency room technician. She picked up a second shift.
And she was now working basically two jobs at this E.R. and at another
hospital.

And you see that her life, according to her social media posts, is
really on this positive trajectory. She's bought herself a new car.
She's going to save up for a home. And crucially, in mid-February, she
appears to break up for good with Jamarcus Glover. And the reason I say
for good is there's evidence that's come out since then that indicates
that she actually blocked him on her cell phone.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (speaker)\\
  These two here, they might as well get married.
\item
  archived recording (breonna taylor)\\
  Do you want to be my baby daddy?
\item

And from what we know ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  Everything was, like, really good. It was great.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

--- she seems to commit to Kenny.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  There was a whole lot of marriage talk and baby talk. We even had baby
  names and everything. Kenbre, just for the record, that was the girl
  name. That's Kenny and Bre mixed. I liked that.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

So they're very much launched on what looks to be a serious
relationship.

But even as these sweeping changes are occurring in Breonna Taylor's
life, the police are barreling forward on their investigation.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

rukmini callimachi

And they believe by March that they have enough evidence to hit five
locations that are crucial to Jamarcus Glover's criminal syndicate. Four
of them are on Elliott Avenue and around Elliott Avenue --- these are
the trap houses that he operated. And the fifth is the home of Breonna
Taylor.

michael barbaro

Tomorrow on ``The Daily'': What happened during the police raid?

We'll be right back.

Here's what else you need to know today. The chief of police in
Rochester, New York resigned on Tuesday, amid growing outrage and
widening investigations into the death of Daniel Prude by officers in
his department. Prude suffocated after police placed a hood over his
head and pressed him into the ground for two minutes --- a death that
Rochester officials did not disclose for months. The police chief,
La'Ron Singletary, has denied that the officers involved did anything
wrong.

And ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (albert bourla)\\
  It is an unprecedented moment. It's an historic pledge. Nine vaccine
  makers are coming out, saying that they will stand with science.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- in an unusual public pledge, the C.E.O.s of nine drug companies,
including Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, said that they would not
distribute a vaccine for the coronavirus until it had been thoroughly
vetted for safety and effectiveness.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (albert bourla)\\
  With increasing public concerns about the processes that we are using
  to develop these vaccines, and even more importantly, the processes
  that will be used to evaluate these vaccines, we saw it as critical to
  come out and reiterate our commitment that we will develop our
  products our vaccines, using the highest ethical standards.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

The statement appeared to be a response to claims by President Trump
that a vaccine would be ready before Election Day, raising fears that
the president may rush the process and undermine public trust in an
eventual vaccine.

That's it for ``The Daily.'' I'm Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

Rukmini, where does your reporting start for this story?

rukmini callimachi

So I met my colleague, the documentary filmmaker, Yoruba Richen, in
Louisville.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  yoruba richen\\
  So can you start off by telling me your names and what your relation
  is to Breonna?
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And we spent the next couple of weeks speaking to the people who knew
Breonna best.

\begin{itemize}

  My name's Tamika Palmer. I have two daughters.

Her cousins.

  I would say our relationship was more like sisters, twin cousins. Pre

rukmini callimachi

Her very best friends going all the way back to her childhood. Her
co-workers. And in combination with the thousands of pages of documents
that I was able to acquire about her case, what comes across is that
this is a young woman who was dealt, I would say a pretty tough hand in
life.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  yoruba richen\\
  What was your reaction when you find out you were pregnant? How old
  were you?
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  {[}LAUGHS{]} I was, like, in disbelief. I was 16 years old though. So
  ---

rukmini callimachi

She was born to a teenage mom.

\item
  tamika palmer\\
  I just knew I had to be a better person then, at that point. So I took
  it on.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

Her dad was convicted on a murder and drug charge when she was just six
years old and was sent to prison for the rest of her life.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  yoruba richen\\
  What was she like as a child?
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  Breonna was a good kid. She was easy, even just as a young kid. She
  just was --- she was smart.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

But what you also see amidst the challenges of her early life is a
person who was trying to push beyond the limitations of her
circumstances.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  She was one of those people, she made a plan, and she went. That was
  it. Like, it has to be done this way. And, like, OK.
\item
  preonia flakes\\
  Just seeing how she was wanting to be successful, she kind of, like,
  drove that into my head. Like, this is what we're going to do. This is
  how you're going to do it. And I'm going to show you how to do it.
\end{itemize}

We spoke to one of her oldest friends who said that her mom, when they
were children, would not let her go to sleepovers at all, except if the
sleepover was at Breonna's house. Why? Because Breonna was considered
the responsible one. She was the one among their little group of friends
who made sure that the other girls got to school on time if there was a
sleepover, who made sure that they did their homework. She seemed to be
taking almost an adult role in her immediate circle.

  Even as a kid, I can remember her being 7 years old, saying to my
  mother, let me check your blood sugar.
\end{itemize}

When she was very young, she started to show an interest in medicine,
and in health care and in helping other people. Her mom describes how,
when Breonna learned that her grandmother had an insulin problem, she
wanted to prick her grandmother's finger with a needle and draw blood so
that she could test her blood sugar level. She thought that that was
interesting. And she kept on asking her grandmother if she could do
that.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  tamika palmer\\
  Like, leave her alone! But she --- my mother would let her stick her
  finger in. And she was so pumped up to do it. And helped her do her
  insulin. I'm like, oh, my God.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

We see that in ninth grade, she begged her mom to give her permission to
take the bus and to go start working at a local fast food joint after
school. Her friends say that they never really knew her without a job.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  preonia flakes\\
  She taught me stuff my own people, my own siblings, my own mother
  didn't teach me. The family I came from, really not supportive. So I
  used to make little Facebook statuses like, who's going to come to my
  graduation if I had it, even though I know y'all don't really mess
  with me? Bre would be, like, don't worry about them. And as long as
  I'm by your side, that's all that matters. Because I'm a leader.
\end{itemize}

Breonna is the first person in her family to graduate from high school.
And she then goes to college.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  yoruba richen\\
  Tell me how you met?
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  We met, I guess on Twitter.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

In college, she starts a banter on Twitter with another college student.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  Kind of like, flirting on the timeline, I guess, so to say.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

His name was Kenneth Walker. He went by Kenny to all of his friends.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  And she went to University of Kentucky. And I went to Western
  Kentucky.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And they start a sort of emoji-filled, flirtatious Twitter banter that,
by 2016, evolved into the beginnings of a romance and of a relationship.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  I kept on telling her I don't want to be friends no more. But we can
  be if we have to be. But I don't want to be.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

It was an on again, off again relationship. But what's clear in this
back and forth is that Kenny seemed to really have identified her as the
person that he wanted to be his life partner.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  Seems like when nobody else was there for me, she was always there.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And it was Breonna that wasn't 100 percent sure about him.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  Some days it was, yeah, let's marry and have a kid. And then other
  days, like, no, let's be single and live kid-free lives. So there was
  a million time when I'd say I'm not messing with her anymore ever
  again. And I'm sure she said the same thing several times.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

But everybody we spoke to described him as somebody who genuinely loved
her.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  kenneth walker\\
  We can be friends. And we can be everything else, too. That's the goal
  when you trying to be with somebody or love them, whatever. You want
  to be friends with them also. And that's rare. So if you come across
  that, I think you should try to take advantage of it.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

What we now know is that a few months after she started dating Kenny in
2016, she also starts seeing another man. His name is Jamarcus Glover.
And by all accounts, he's, in many ways, the opposite of Kenny.

Jamarcus is a twice convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced in 2008 when
he was 18 years old in Mississippi, his home state, for drug
trafficking. And later in 2014, he moves to Kentucky. He's charged again
for drug possession. And he would spend the next several years in and
out of jail.

And it bears noting that he seems to enter her life at what was
ostensibly a low point. She had started college. But she dropped out
because she felt homesick and was really missing her family. She got her
E.M.T. certification and began working as a first responder, riding
ambulances. But a year into that job, she quit. On social media, she
says that she was discouraged by the 16-hour shifts and by the low pay.
And pretty soon into her relationship with Jamarcus, his problems become
her problems.

So what happened is she had rented a car. Her own car was apparently in
the shop. So she had rented a car from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. And
Jamarcus Glover asked her for the keys. She handed over the keys. He
then handed them to a third person, a man. And a couple of hours later,
that person was found dead, slumped over the wheel of the car. His body
was riddled with bullets. And on the floorboard of the car and in the
console, they found several baggies of drugs.

The person that ends up dead at the wheel of the car is a man that's
known to them only by his nickname Rambo. And in fact, he's the brother
of one of Jamarcus Glover's associates, a member of what turns out to be
a criminal drug syndicate. And that man had gone to jail on multiple
occasions with Jamarcus.

I saw the police notes. And they concluded that Breonna really had no
foreknowledge of how this car was going to be used. And that Jamarcus
also did not appear to be aware that this man was going to get killed.

michael barbaro

We'll be right back.

Rukmini, when you talked to Breonna's family and her friends, did
Jamarcus come up? And what did they say about him?

rukmini callimachi

You know, this was really hard to get at. Because when we spoke to her
mother, her cousins, her best friends, you ask about Jamarcus Glover and
either they stopped making eye contact with you, or they say to you that
they don't want to talk about him. Or they say to you that they don't
know him. And this relationship is something that we have essentially
uncovered through documents.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

rukmini callimachi

This was clearly something that those who love her did not want to talk
about. The closest I got was one of her oldest childhood friends,
somebody who's known her since she was in elementary school. And all she
would say to me was, I didn't like him --- regarding Jamarcus.

But what we see in the documents that we've amassed is that in the next
four years, she was on again and off again with Kenny and with Jamarcus.
And in the periods that she's with Jamarcus, he repeatedly entangles her
in his problems and in his run-ins and dealings with police. This is a
man who is in and out of jail. And he asks her to pay his bail twice in
2017.

And then later, in 2019, you see her paying bail for another man,
another accused drug dealer who was a friend of Jamarcus's, and who was
believed to be part of this criminal syndicate alongside him.

\begin{itemize}

And when he gets pulled over for the infraction of making a wide turn,
things very quickly escalate.

He's pulled out of his car by the white police officer.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  Yeah. We're allowed to pat you down copper for a wide turn.
\item

\item

He's on the phone with his mom. And the cops begin searching his car for
drugs.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  --- and stay over here, please. Ma'am, please stay over here.
\end{itemize}

His mom eventually shows up.

\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  Ma'am, if you approach my traffic stop, I will take you to jail. I

\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

And in the conversation that ensues, another officer begins to explain
to the mom the larger strategy of what they're trying to do with these
traffic stops.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (mother)\\
  What I'm saying is, if it's a wrong turn, give him a ticket. You don't
  have to bring ---

\item

\item
  archived recording (mother)\\
  But what do you mean violent?
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  So listen. Just --- will you listen to me? Because I want to explain
  ---
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

What they would do is they would identify an area that had a high crime
rate. And then they would flood that area with police officers who would
pull people over for minor offenses --- for turning without signaling,
for having a broken tail light, for making a wide turn. And once the
people were pulled over, they would search their cars for drugs or for
other contraband and essentially look for evidence of more serious
offenses.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (mother)\\
  I don't care. I appreciate y'all being out here for ``violent''
  crimes. My son is not a ``violent'' nothing.
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  No one said he was a violent crime. No one said he was.
\item
  archived recording (mother)\\
  He shouldn't even be out of the car handcuffed right now.
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  Can you tell me --- can you tell me how to pick out violent crimes?
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

As a result, it created a lot of bad will between the city's police
department and the city's Black population. Black people who were just
going about their daily lives were getting pulled over and aggressively
searched when they were doing nothing more than, like the teenage boy in
the viral video, going to the store to get a slushie in his mom's car.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  archived recording (police officer)\\
  All right, sir, he's your ID back. You've got court October 2 for
  improper turning at 7:00 p.m. {[}INAUDIBLE{]} Do you understand the
  reason why you're stopped?

  All righty. Have a wonderful day.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

So it just so happened that the week that the video of the homecoming
king went viral, that week coincided with a visit to the department of a
policing expert named Robin Engel. She's a professor at the University
of Cincinnati. And she has been promoting a different approach to
policing that has actually really been successful and borne fruit in a
couple of communities, including Cincinnati and Las Vegas. When the
video caused the uproar that it caused, the police chief pulled her
aside in a conference room and said to her, how can we do better?

michael barbaro

And what was her answer?

rukmini callimachi

Her answer was instead of flooding a large area with police, you go
hyper focused. And you look at a micro location that has been the locus
of repeat crime --- a storefront, an abandoned warehouse, a city block,
an apartment building. And you ask yourself, what is it about that
specific location? What are the parameters of that location that are
making it conducive to repeat crime?

And then once you identify that place, you begin putting a lot of police
resources into monitoring that microlocation. And she told him about how
this method of policing had dramatically reduced violent crime as much
as 70 percent to 80 percent in one particular neighborhood in
Cincinnati. So when the police chief hears about this, he naturally got
excited.

And by December of last year, the police department had created its own
squad that was going to target crime through this new method. So the
next thing that happens is they identify the area of the city that has
the highest crime. And they end up honing in on a street called Elliot
Avenue, the 2400 block of Elliott Avenue --- basically one city block.

So it was on this block that they erected a pole camera in January. What
they saw is that within an hour of erecting the camera on January 2,
between 15 and 20 cars had stopped in front of 2424 Eliott Avenue. 2424
Eliott Avenue was one of four trap houses, or drug houses, that were
being operated by Jamarcus Glover. And this is how Jamarcus basically
ends up in the crosshairs of this new squad that was created for the
purpose of reforming police conduct in the city.

That same day, this is January 2, in addition to seeing the 15 to 20
cars that stopped in front of this house --- these are presumably
customers who are coming and going, buying drugs --- they see between
5:00 and 6:00 p.m. that evening a Chevrolet Impala pull up. They run the
plates. And they learn that that car is registered to Breonna Taylor.

\item

  OK.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

So Jamarcus gets bailed out. And in the course of the next two months,
this newly created squad continues to surveil the trap house at the 2400
block of Elliott. They end up putting a G.P.S. on Jamarcus' car. And
that G.P.S. shows that he makes repeated trips in January between the
trap house and Breonna Taylor's apartment. They also send police to
watch her apartment.

And on one day in mid-January, they photograph Jamarcus going into her
apartment and emerging from it with a package in his hands, and then
driving straight back to the trap house. On another occasion in
February, they film her and him arriving in the same car at the trap
house. He is seen getting out of the driver's side door.

She's seen getting out of the passenger side door. He goes into the trap
house. He comes back out. And they drive away together. But the thing
that the police had missed as they were carrying out this intense
surveillance was the new arc of Breonna Taylor's life that had been
building for some time.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  preonia flakes\\
  This is messages from January. It says: ``This year I'm coming for
  everything.'' She said, ``I'm speaking it into existence.'' And she
  sent two emojis with the fingers crossed and some hearts. She was
  coming for everything she wanted this year. 2020 was her year.
\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

After leaving her job as an E.M.T., she got back on her feet. And she
got a job as an emergency room technician. She picked up a second shift.
And she was now working basically two jobs at this E.R. and at another
hospital.

And you see that her life, according to her social media posts, is
really on this positive trajectory. She's bought herself a new car.
She's going to save up for a home. And crucially, in mid-February, she
appears to break up for good with Jamarcus Glover. And the reason I say
for good is there's evidence that's come out since then that indicates
that she actually blocked him on her cell phone.

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

rukmini callimachi

So they're very much launched on what looks to be a serious
relationship.

But even as these sweeping changes are occurring in Breonna Taylor's
life, the police are barreling forward on their investigation.

michael barbaro

Mhm.

rukmini callimachi

And they believe by March that they have enough evidence to hit five
locations that are crucial to Jamarcus Glover's criminal syndicate. Four
of them are on Elliott Avenue and around Elliott Avenue --- these are
the trap houses that he operated. And the fifth is the home of Breonna
Taylor.

Tomorrow on ``The Daily'': What happened during the police raid?

We'll be right back.

Here's what else you need to know today. The chief of police in
Rochester, New York resigned on Tuesday, amid growing outrage and
widening investigations into the death of Daniel Prude by officers in
his department. Prude suffocated after police placed a hood over his
head and pressed him into the ground for two minutes --- a death that
Rochester officials did not disclose for months. The police chief,
La'Ron Singletary, has denied that the officers involved did anything
wrong.

And ---

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (albert bourla)\\
  It is an unprecedented moment. It's an historic pledge. Nine vaccine
  makers are coming out, saying that they will stand with science.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

--- in an unusual public pledge, the C.E.O.s of nine drug companies,
including Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, said that they would not
distribute a vaccine for the coronavirus until it had been thoroughly
vetted for safety and effectiveness.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  archived recording (albert bourla)\\
  With increasing public concerns about the processes that we are using
  to develop these vaccines, and even more importantly, the processes
  that will be used to evaluate these vaccines, we saw it as critical to
  come out and reiterate our commitment that we will develop our
  products our vaccines, using the highest ethical standards.
\end{itemize}

michael barbaro

The statement appeared to be a response to claims by President Trump
that a vaccine would be ready before Election Day, raising fears that
the president may rush the process and undermine public trust in an
eventual vaccine.

That's it for ``The Daily.'' I'm Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.

When asked about Breonna Taylor, her loved ones paint a picture of a
determined, responsible young woman: ``One of those people she made a
plan and she went --- that was it.''

As part of an investigation for The New York Times, our correspondent
Rukmini Callimachi and the documentary filmmaker Yoruba Richen spent
weeks interviewing those who were closest to Ms. Taylor, who was killed
in her home by the police in Louisville, Ky., in March. She was 26.

``She taught me stuff my own people, my own siblings, my own mother
didn't teach me,'' Preonia Flakes, Ms. Taylor's cousin, told Rukmini and
Yoruba.

Kenneth Walker, Ms. Taylor's boyfriend, said: ``She was just so kind and
loving and caring.''

The first of her family to graduate from high school, with an interest
in medicine and health care, she emerged from the discussions as someone
who, despite being dealt a tough hand in life, was determined to push
beyond the limitations of her circumstance.

At the beginning of 2020, Ms. Taylor posted on social media that it was
going to be her year. After an apparent low point, her life was
changing: She was planning a family with Mr. Walker, she had a new job
and a new car. She had also blocked Jamarcus Glover, a convicted drug
dealer with whom she had **** been romantically involved on and off
since 2016, from her phone.

But forces were already in motion. The Louisville Police Department was
preparing raids on locations it had linked to Mr. Glover --- and Ms.
Taylor's address was on the target list.

Today, in the first of two parts, we explore Ms. Taylor's life and how
law enforcement ended up at her door.
