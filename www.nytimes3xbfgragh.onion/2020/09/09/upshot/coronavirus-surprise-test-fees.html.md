*The New York Times is investigating the costs associated with testing
and treatment for the coronavirus and how the pandemic is changing
health care in America. You can read more about the project and submit
your medical bills*
[*here*](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/costofcare)*.*

Sarah Goldstone got a coronavirus test in Massachusetts after her health
insurer said it was “waiving cost sharing for Covid-19 testing-related
visits.”

Amanda Bowes, a health policy analyst in Maryland, got hers because she
knew a new federal law should make coronavirus testing free for insured
patients like her.

Kelly Daisley had one after seeing New York City’s ads offering free
tests. “Do it for them,” says one bus shelter ad near her home, showing
a happy family.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

All three were surprised when their health insurers said that they were
responsible for a significant chunk of their bills — in Ms. Daisley’s
case, as much as $2,718.

“I had seen so many commercials saying there is testing everywhere, it’s
free, you don’t need insurance,” said Ms. Daisley, 47, who was tested at
an urgent care center three blocks from her Brooklyn apartment. “If I
had to pay it off, it would clear out my savings.”

For months, Americans have been told not to worry about the costs of
coronavirus tests, which are crucial to stopping the pandemic’s spread.
“It is critical that Americans have peace of mind knowing that cost
won’t be a barrier to testing during this national public health
emergency,” Medicare’s administrator, Seema Verma, said in April.

Congress passed laws requiring insurers to pay for tests, and the Trump
administration created a program to cover the [bills of the
uninsured](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/29/health/Covid-obamacare-uninsured.html).
Cities and states set up no-cost testing sites.

They are not alone. About 2.4 percent of coronavirus tests billed to
insurers leave the patient responsible for some portion of payment,
according to the health data firm Castlight. With [77 million
tests](https://covidtracking.com/) performed so far, it could add up to
hundreds of thousands of Americans who receive unexpected

“Whether it’s through legislative action or public statements, Congress
has made it really clear that there shouldn’t be cost sharing for
Covid-19 testing,” said Julie Khani, president of the American Clinical
Laboratory Association. “In practice, that’s not really the case.”

In some cases, the charges appear to violate new federal laws that aim
to make coronavirus tests free for privately insured patients. In other
cases, insurers are interpreting gray areas in these new rules in ways
that work in their favor.

When asked about these charges, health plans say they are doing their
best to follow the rules and cover all costs related to the testing. “If
a claim is submitted with the proper coding to demonstrate that a test
was given to diagnose Covid-19, or that a service was delivered to treat
Covid-19, generally the claims for those tests and services are being
covered at no cost to the patient,” said Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman
for America’s Health Insurance Plans.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The insurers faulted the complexity of American medical billing, which
can sometimes make it hard to tell when a coronavirus test is provided.
Insurers can’t know to cover a claim differently if hospitals and doctor
offices don’t use the right
codes.

The new rules that Congress wrote midyear do not slot neatly into
insurers’ billing systems. One health insurer said it was having to
manually revise each claim for a coronavirus test, deleting the charges
one by one.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

“This is legitimately a confusing area, and the coding is all evolving,”
said Christen Linke Young, a Brookings Institution fellow who helped
write federal billing rules during her time at the Department of Health
and Human Services. “Even if you’re an insurer or provider operating in
good faith, and think you know what the rules are, figuring out how to
identify relevant claims is a hurdle.”

Congress has legislated twice on coronavirus test billing. The [Families
First Coronavirus Response
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201/text),
passed in March, told insurers they could not charge co-payments or
apply deductibles to coronavirus tests and other “items and services
furnished” during the doctor visit. The rules apply to tests both to
detect the disease and to those for antibodies.

The [CARES Act](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares) built on
those protections. It created rules for how to handle out-of-network
coronavirus tests, telling insurers those, too, had to be covered at no
cost to the patient. Insurers estimate that about 10 percent of
coronavirus tests have been billed out of network so far, and that those
tests tend to be more expensive than those in
network.

Patients’ bills suggest that the rules aren’t always being followed.
Insurers have, for example, applied co-payments and deductibles to the
tests, claim documents show.

Ms. Bowes, from Maryland, was especially surprised to be charged a $50
co-payment for a coronavirus test at an urgent care center. She knew
from her work as a health policy analyst for the National Association of
Attorneys General that this wasn’t supposed to happen.

“I was really shocked when I got the bill,” she said. “It felt wrong,
and I was angry especially because we were being billed before even
receiving our results.” After protesting the fee to her insurer, the
charge was reversed and
covered.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak ›

#### Frequently Asked Questions

Updated September 4, 2020

  - #### What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
    
      - In the beginning, the coronavirus [seemed like it was primarily
        a respiratory
        illness](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-facts-history.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq#link-6817bab5) —
        many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and
        coughed a lot, though some people don’t show many symptoms at
        all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory
        distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now,
        doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In
        April, [the C.D.C. added to the list of early
        signs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) sore
        throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset,
        such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another
        telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution
        of one’s [sense of smell and
        taste.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) Teenagers
        and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and
        purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe”
        — but few other serious symptoms.

  - #### Why is it safer to spend time together outside?
    
      - [Outdoor
        gatherings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) lower
        risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can
        kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from
        building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can
        happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long
        stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the
        University of Leicester.

  - #### Why does standing six feet away from others help?
    
      - The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your
        mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C.,
        one of the organizations using that measure, [bases its
        recommendation of six
        feet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) on
        the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they
        cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six
        feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete
        protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot
        farther than six feet, [according to a recent
        study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).
        It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet
        apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at
        all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

  - #### I have antibodies. Am I now immune?
    
      - As of right now,[ that seems likely, for at least several
        months.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/health/covid-antibodies-herd-immunity.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) There
        have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to
        be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may
        have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a
        slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People
        infected with the coronavirus typically
        [produce](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9) immune
        molecules called antibodies, which are [protective proteins made
        in response to an
        infection](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq)[.
        These antibodies
        may](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) last
        in the body [only two to three
        months](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6),
        which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an
        acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist
        at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus
        again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a
        short window of time from initial infection or make people
        sicker the second time.

  - #### What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?
    
      - Employers have to provide [a safe
        workplace](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html) with
        policies that protect everyone equally. [And if one of your
        co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the
        C.D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_faq) has
        said that [employers should tell their
        employees](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) --
        without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may
        have been exposed to the
virus.

Some patients found that insurance covered the test but denied payment
for other services that went with it: another billing decision that
could violate federal law.

One mother in California was surprised that her daughter’s coronavirus
test was fully covered but that a $49 “after hours” fee was not — the
clinic said it provided tests only in the evening, so as to not infect
other patients.

Insurers have told some patients they are responsible for out-of-network
charges, even though federal law appears to require insurers to at least
partly cover them. This includes Ms. Goldstone from Massachusetts, who
went for a test after experiencing mild coronavirus symptoms.

UnitedHealth paid $160 for her coronavirus test, but denied the $250
doctor visit that went with it, stating that her plan did not come with
out-of-network benefits.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s upsetting and demoralizing,” said Ms. Goldstone, a musician who
has been largely out of work since the start of the pandemic. “I’ve
spent months being careful with my finances, and already pay $266 a
month for insurance.”

Federal law requires insurers to pay for any doctor visit associated
with a coronavirus test, specifically noting that visits to urgent care
centers are included. It is silent, however, on how much an insurer must
pay to an out-of-network facility — although most experts agree a health
plan would need to pay something rather than deny the fee.

“They shouldn’t be able to do that,” Ms. Young of Brookings said. “But I
have sympathy for them and their claims system. It probably has rules
that are saying: This person doesn’t have out-of-network coverage.”

UnitedHealth said it denied the charge because of how the urgent care
center did its billing: It divided the coronavirus test and the visit
into separate claims. After an inquiry from The Times, the insurer said
it would reverse the bill and review how the urgent care center billed
for its services.

“UnitedHealthcare is waiving cost share for Covid-19 testing, in
accordance with state and federal guidelines, including the test Ms.
Goldstone received,” a spokeswoman, Maria Gordon Shydlo, said. “She will
not be responsible for the
costs.”

Other bills present murkier situations. Ms. Daisley, from Brooklyn, had
coronavirus diagnostic and antibody tests last month. She was surprised
when she logged into her health insurance portal and saw four claims
associated with her tests: one for each test, one for the doctor visit,
and one for other tests she didn’t realize were being ordered.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Her insurance covered the visit and the diagnostic test. But it paid
nothing for an antibody test and the other lab services, which were both
sent off to out-of-network providers.

Experts say federal law requires the insurer to cover the antibody test
in full, even out of network. But the rules around the other tests are
less clear: The law states that insurers must cover services related to
obtaining a coronavirus test but doesn’t identify what type of care
makes the cut. Some providers seem to tack on unrelated lab tests.
Patients at a drive-through coronavirus testing site in Texas, for
example, were [unknowingly tested for sexually transmitted
diseases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/upshot/coronavirus-tests-unpredictable-prices.html).
Without clear federal guidance, insurers are left to sift through
charges to decide what is related to coronavirus and what isn’t.

Initially, Ms. Daisley was left with more than $2,000 to pay to
out-of-network labs: $210 for the antibody test and $2,508 for the other
lab services. Her health plan, Anthem, denied the larger charge because
her health benefits do not cover out-of-network care.

The insurer covered the charges after The Times inquired. “Seeing as Ms.
Daisley was unaware the treating provider would send her samples to
multiple out-of-network labs for what she understood was related to
Covid testing, Anthem is covering the costs of the outstanding claims,”
a spokeswoman for Anthem, Leslie Porras, said.
