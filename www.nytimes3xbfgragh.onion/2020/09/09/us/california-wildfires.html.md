*Good morning.*

**First, here’s an update on the wildfires burning across the state:**

After another weekend plagued by compounding disasters in California,
Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday pointed to his burning state as clear
evidence that climate change — and its most extreme manifestations — is
a major driver of the fires’ scale and severity.

And even as the Trump administration has pushed to roll back
regulations, Mr. Newsom said the state would push ahead with its
efforts.

“In the absence of federal leadership, California will continue to
lead,” he said. “The more we push into this space, more partners will
be forthcoming.”

*\[Read more about how* [*California’s “demonized”
winds*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/us/santa-ana-winds-diablo-saddleridge-fire-blackouts.html)
*shape wildfire season.\]*

Still, the picture he laid out of millions of burned acres, thousands of
homes and buildings destroyed, all with the looming threat of dangerous
[Santa Ana and Diablo
winds](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/14/us/santa-ana-winds-diablo-saddleridge-fire-blackouts.html)
in coming days, wasn’t encouraging.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Newsom said that 7,606
[fires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/fires-washington-california-oregon-malden.html)
have burned 2.3 million acres in California this year. That’s a record
in modern history.

Although last year’s was a less active
[fire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/wildfires-california-oregon-washington.html)
season — [it followed a rainy
winter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/01/us/california-today-extreme-weather-forecast.html)
— the governor noted that by this time last year, just 118,000 acres had
burned in 4,927 fires.

*\[Read the* [*latest
updates*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?name=styln-california-wildfires&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&impression_id=69d920f1-f259-11ea-bef8-f7a505c4b1e2&variant=1_Show)
*on the fires.\]*

And that’s just in California; wildfires were [burning across the
West](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?name=styln-california-wildfires&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&impression_id=68a81b00-f259-11ea-867a-a3448642d022&variant=1_Show).
And that’s just the early part of what is likely to be a highly active
and dangerous fire season.

As of Tuesday, Mr. Newsom said firefighters from not just the United
States but other countries were battling major fires, including the
Creek Fire, which prompted a dramatic rescue of hundreds of campers.

*\[Read* [*about the rescue
here*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/california-wildfires-helicopter-rescue.html?referringSource=articleShare)*.\]*

While he noted that a vast majority of the state’s fires had been
sparked by people — on purpose or inadvertently — Mr. Newsom said the
weekend’s extraordinary heat made fighting fires and preventing new ones
especially difficult.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Never have I felt more of a sense of obligation and a sense of purpose
to maintain California’s leadership not only nationally but
internationally to face climate change head on,” he said.

Pacific Gas & Electric on Monday started cutting power to 170,000
customers in an effort to [prevent its equipment from sparking
additional
blazes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?name=styln-california-wildfires&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&impression_id=69d920f1-f259-11ea-bef8-f7a505c4b1e2&variant=1_Show#link-ae8e448).

## A quick update on reopening

The governor on Tuesday announced the first handful of counties to move
from the most restrictive of the [state’s new reopening
tiers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html)
into a tier that allows more businesses to operate indoors at reduced
capacity, including restaurants, gyms and houses of worship.

*\[Read about the new,* [*color-coded tier
system*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html)*.\]*

The counties that were moved [to the less restrictive red tier from the
purple included](https://covid19.ca.gov/) Amador, Orange, Placer, Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz.

Although the news was encouraging, it seemed to depart from Mr. Newsom’s
emphasis a little more than a week ago when he unveiled the new system
that counties would be [required to spend at least three
weeks](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-s-new-rules-for-coronavirus-15522578.php)
in each tier before being allowed to further ease
restrictions.

**Now, as millions of kids around the** **[country return to
school](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/spotlight/schools-reopening?)**
**— virtually and not — my colleague** **[Marie Tae
McDermott](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/marie-tae-mcdermott)**
**looked into a question about school pods.**

Buffy Kinstle, a reader in San Francisco, asked us: “I’ve noticed a
surge in local families seeking to create micro schools and pandemic
mini pods, in some cases with plans to hire private teachers to manage
their kids’ educational and child care needs. What are school districts
doing to protect public access to free education for all, support
working families who cannot afford private small-group education, and
retain qualified educators?”

My colleague Abby Goodnough [wrote about how small-group education is on
the rise across the
country](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/us/covid-schools-learning-pods.html).
While many wealthy families are hiring private educators to teach their
children, some families are priced out of pods and virtual learning
alternatives, leading to a [widening education
gap](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html)
for students.

The solution, some say, is for school districts to provide small-group
learning to families for free. Alpine Union School District, a small
community in eastern San Diego County, was one of the first in the state
to offer families this option, according to the district’s
superintendent, Richard Newman.

*\[Read all of our* [*coverage of
schools*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/spotlight/schools-reopening?)
*reopening.\]*

Alpine’s learning pods started a little over two weeks ago. Parents take
turns supervising a fixed cohort of 12 students. The students receive
virtual instruction from their teachers, and one teacher assigned to the
pod provides face-to-face support. The district provides the physical
location, technology, curriculum and facilitates safety protocols.

The California Department of Public Health [released a set of health
guidelines for facilitating groups of
students](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx),
which Dr. Newman said his learning pods met. Alpine is also relatively
small, with only 1,700 students from kindergarten through **** eighth
grade.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On a larger scale, San Francisco is transforming recreation facilities,
libraries and community centers into learning hubs, where some 6,000
students will be able to go daily to complete their online schoolwork
and engage in programming and outdoor play.

In light of the [state’s new reopening
rules](https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/template/oakv2?campaign_id=49&emc=edit_ca_20200831&instance_id=21774&nl=california-today&productCode=CA&regi_id=68519573&segment_id=37216&te=1&uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fef87c1d8-ddb3-57ab-8f46-f3d9b9d9b92c&user_id=ac4ca2966d3316b2e2f6ffbb6a584192),
Mayor London Breed said in a news conference that the learning hubs
would open as planned in mid-September and that enrollment was nearly
full.

“Even when we provided them with devices and internet service, they are
still falling further behind,” Ms. Breed said. “It is so important we
opened these learning hubs, and we are almost at capacity.”

Still, Liana Chavarín, a single parent and director of the [Berkeley
Forest School](http://berkeleyforestschool.org), expressed frustration
over the lack of options currently available to families. Her school
district **** in Berkeley has a program that offers families a more
flexible schedule, but the program is already full.

“If a single parent like myself doesn’t have the option to work from
home and my family doesn’t have the option to enroll in the district’s
independent study program, that leaves me with no choice but to unenroll
my child,” she said.

Ms. Chavarín decided to incorporate the [Roots & Waters
Collective](http://www.berkeleyforestschool.org/roots-and-waters-collective),
a cohort of elementary school-age children, into her school. Many of her
students come from low-income households or are children of essential
workers, she said. **** Because students and teachers at her forest
school spend their days outdoors in small groups, they are able to learn
and explore at a safe distance from one another. The school offers
tuition on a sliding scale.

In Alpine, Dr. Newman said he planned on welcoming students back to
campus in the coming weeks in a hybrid learning model that combines
virtual and in-person classes. However, because students will be
attending campus only on certain days, the learning pods will stay in
place.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Newman said that single parents, parents of children with special
needs and families with means have all signed on to use the pods.

“I think this is a good example of how we might change education down
the road.” he said. The question now is: “How do we provide more
opportunities for students to learn, parents to be engaged and use the
resources of a school district?”
