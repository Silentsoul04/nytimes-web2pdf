Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading infectious diseases expert,
expressed concern Wednesday morning about the example President Trump
had set the night before when he held a large campaign rally in North
Carolina without wearing a mask.

\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/video/dr-anthony-fauci-on-the-race-for-a-covid-19-vaccine/\#x}{Appearing
on ``CBS This Morning}'' to discuss the hunt for a coronavirus vaccine,
Dr. Fauci was asked whether the sight of such rallies was frustrating
for him.

``Well, yes it is, and I've said that often,'' he said. ``We want to set
an example.''

Some North Carolina Republicans also said they hoped the president would
wear a mask.

Before the rally, Dave Plyler, chairman of the Forsyth County Board of
Commissioners,
\href{https://journalnow.com/news/local/president-trump-should-wear-a-mask-during-his-visit-to-winston-salem-county-republican-says/article_551be240-ee3c-11ea-aaac-07490e3d44da.html\#1}{was
quoted by The Winston-Salem Journal} as saying that he believed Mr.
Trump should wear a mask.

``It's been ordered by the governor,'' Mr. Plyler, a Republican, said.
``When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in North Carolina, do as the
governor says.''

But Mr. Trump, who has worn masks publicly only a handful of times, and
who
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/03/us/trump-vs-biden\#at-a-latrobe-pa-rally-trump-boasts-of-getting-along-with-russia}{mocked
his Democratic opponent,} Joseph R. Biden Jr., for wearing one just last
week, appeared without one.
\href{https://journalnow.com/news/columnists/red-hats-outnumber-masks-100-to-1-at-trump-rally-in-winston-salem/article_68b65640-f239-11ea-be2c-ab2e9b586707.html}{Scott
Sexton, a columnist at The Journal, wrote after the rally} that ``red
hats outnumbered masks and face coverings by at least a 100-to-1
ratio.''

Dr. Fauci said that measures such as wearing masks, keeping physical
distance, avoiding crowds and moving activities outdoors ``are the kind
of things that turn around surges and also prevent us from getting
surges.''

``So I certainly would like to see a universal wearing of masks,'' he
said.
