# Trump Admits Downplaying the Virus Knowing It Was ‘Deadly Stuff’

</div>

In taped interviews with the journalist Bob Woodward, the president said
as early as February that the virus was more dangerous than the flu,
even as he told the country otherwise.

President Trump acknowledged to the journalist [Bob
Woodward](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/politics/trump-woodward.html)
that he [knowingly played
down](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/03/18/us/trump-coronavirus-statements-timeline.html)
the coronavirus earlier this year even though he was aware it was
life-threatening and vastly more serious than the seasonal flu.

“This is deadly stuff,” Mr. Trump said on Feb. 7 in one of 18 interviews
with Mr. Woodward for his coming book, “Rage.”

“You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” the president
told Mr. Woodward in audio recordings [made available on The Washington
Post
website](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump/2020/09/09/0368fe3c-efd2-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html).
“And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also
more deadly than even your strenuous flus.”

But three days after those remarks, Mr. Trump [told the Fox Business
anchor Trish Regan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IWRP9fzY74): “We’re
in very good shape. We have 11 cases. And most of them are getting
better very rapidly. I think they will all be better.” A little less
than two weeks later, he told reporters on the South Lawn that “we have
it very much under control in this country.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

By Feb. 26, the president was publicly dismissing concerns about the
lethality of the virus. “It’s a little like the regular flu that we have
flu shots for,” he said at a White House news conference. “And ****
we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.”

And by Feb. 28, at a rally in South Carolina, Mr. Trump [denounced
Democrats for their
concerns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/28/us/politics/trump-accuses-media-democrats-coronavirus.html)
about the virus as “their new hoax,” after the Russia investigation and
his impeachment.

The audio recordings show that as Mr. Trump was absorbing in real time
the information he was given by health and national security experts, he
made a conscious choice not only to mislead the public but also to
actively pressure governors to reopen states before his own government
guidelines said they were
ready.

By March, Mr. Trump was straightforward with Mr. Woodward about his
tactics. “I wanted to always play it down,” the president said in an
audio recording of an interview on March 19. “I still like playing it
down, because I don’t want to create a panic.”

“This is deadly stuff,” the president repeated for emphasis.

Despite the president’s own words in the recordings, the White House
press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, told reporters on Wednesday that Mr.
Trump had never publicly played down the virus.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

[The
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump/2020/09/09/0368fe3c-efd2-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html)
and
[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/09/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump-coronavirus/index.html)
were given advance copies of the book and published details on
Wednesday. The New York Times obtained its own copy.

As part of the White House’s effort at damage control, Mr. Trump told
reporters that his recorded remarks to Mr. Woodward were vastly
different from what he was telling the public because he was worried
about frightening people.

“We don’t want to instill panic,” the president said on Wednesday. “We
don’t want to jump up and down and start shouting that we have a problem
that is a tremendous problem” and “scare everybody.”

But his acknowledgment that he was fully aware by early February of the
perils of the virus only intensified questions about why he was so slow
to respond, and why he did not tell Americans the truth to better
prepare them for the worst public health crisis in the United States in
more than a century.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

Mr. Woodward’s book also illustrated that as much as Mr. Trump tries to
change the subject before the November election to law and order and a
call for a crackdown on nationwide protests against police brutality, he
is unable to escape scrutiny for his response to a virus that has killed
[nearly 190,000 people in the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
and [upended the lives of millions
more](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html).

The president also told Mr. Woodward on March 19 of the virus: “Part of
it is the mystery. Part it is the viciousness. You know when it attacks
it attacks the lungs. And I don’t know — when people get hit, when they
get hit, and now it’s turning out it’s not just old people, Bob.” He
went on: “Just today and yesterday, some startling facts came out. It’s
not just old, older. Young people too — plenty of young people.”

And yet in an interview broadcast by “Fox and Friends” on Aug. 5, Mr.
Trump asserted: “If you look at children, children are almost, and I
would say almost definitely, but almost immune from this disease. I
don’t know how you feel about it, but they’ve got stronger immune
systems than we do somehow for this.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Two days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported
that “[children are at risk for severe
Covid-19](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932e3.htm).”

One question swirling in Washington on Wednesday was why Mr. Trump had
given Mr. Woodward such extensive access. Mr. Woodward, a longtime
editor and reporter at The Washington Post who with Carl Bernstein broke
the Watergate scandal that led to [the resignation of President Richard
M.
Nixon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1974/08/09/archives/the-37th-president-is-first-to-quit-post-speaks-of-pain-at-yielding.html),
has written books on most of Mr. Nixon’s successors, many of them
critical. Karl Rove, President George W. Bush’s former top political
adviser, noted on Fox News on Wednesday that nearly every president who
has cooperated with Mr. Woodward regretted it.

Current White House officials said that Mr. Trump opened his door to Mr.
Woodward in the hope that the eventual book would be positive. Mr. Trump
did not speak to Mr. Woodward for his first [book on the Trump
presidency,
“Fear,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/05/books/review-fear-trump-in-white-house-bob-woodward.html)
and the president has maintained that it would [have turned out
better](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/04/us/politics/trump-woodward-book-fear.html)
had he participated. Officials also said that Mr. Trump, who has great
faith in his ability to sell people on his version of events, was eager
to have Mr. Woodward’s seal on his time in office.

Although Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner,
spoke extensively to Mr. Woodward, White House officials were pointing
fingers at one another on Wednesday about who was responsible for giving
the journalist such access.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump repeatedly
bragged about [his limited ban on travel into the United
States](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html)
from China at the end of January, and falsely claimed that almost
everyone disagreed with him at the time. Mr. Woodward’s book documents
that the majority of the president’s advisers urged him to go ahead with
the ban during a meeting in the Oval Office before he ultimately did.

When pressed on why he did not do more in February and March, knowing
what he knew, Mr. Trump maintained that he had not expected the virus to
spread as far and as fast as it did.

“You didn’t really think it was going to be to the point that it was,”
he said. “All of a sudden the world was infected. The entire world was
infected. Everyone was scrambling around looking where to buy face masks
and all of the other things.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

On Capitol Hill, several Republicans defended the president.

“I don’t think he needs to go on TV and scream that we’re all going to
die,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an
ally of the president who White House aides said encouraged the
president to participate in the book. “But his actions of shutting the
economy down were the right actions. I think the tone during that time
sort of spoke for itself. People knew it was serious.”

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he had
not seen the book and directed questions to the White House.

Democrats were quick to slam Mr. Trump for his comments. Senator Chuck
Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said that the book offered
“damning proof that Donald Trump lied and people died.”
