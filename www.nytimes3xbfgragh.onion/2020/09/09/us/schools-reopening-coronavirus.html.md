## Corona dorms and student spreaders

Cases of
[coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/schools-reopening-coronavirus.html)
are [spiking on university
campuses](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/06/us/colleges-coronavirus-students.html),
leaving administrators with two unappealing options: Quarantine students
in dorms, or send them home.

The University of Alabama said it had recently posted university police
officers at its quarantine dorms while Notre Dame said it had [hired
guards](https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/education/notre-dame-hires-more-security-after-students-placed-in-quarantine-violate-rules/article_a9c04f36-e70a-11ea-a52e-e74b0cf9b0f3.html?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_1481931_nl_Daily-Briefing_date_20200831&cid=db&source=ams&sourceId=5289649)
to monitor students in quarantine in hotels and off-campus apartments.
And perhaps unsurprisingly, many schools [are having
trouble](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/22/nyregion/coronavirus-tiktok-college-quarantine-food.html)
running what are essentially disease containment units.

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brianna Hayes was
assigned to a quarantine dorm after developing a fever. Two days later,
the university informed her that she had tested positive and would need
to move again, to a Covid-19 isolation dorm.

There was no university staff in the dorm to help sick students, Ms.
Hayes said, and no elevator. Feverish and exhausted from the virus, she
made four trips up and down staircases to move her bedding and other
belongings to her isolation room. During her week in isolation, she
said, no one from the university came to check on her.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“I felt like everyone was only interested in how I was affecting others,
like who I came in contact with, and then I was just left to be sick,”
[she told our colleague Natasha
Singer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/business/colleges-coronavirus-dormitories-quarantine.html).

As our sister newsletter [The
Morning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/briefing/astrazeneca-california-wildfires-justice-department-your-wednesday-briefing.html)
noted, the alternative to quarantine dorms may be even worse: Sending
potentially sick students back home, where they may spread the virus.
“It’s the worst thing you could do,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal
government’s leading infectious disease expert, [said on the “Today”
show](https://www.today.com/video/dr-anthony-fauci-predicts-safe-and-effective-vaccine-by-end-of-2020-91005509862).

Susan Dynarski, a University of Michigan economist, [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/dynarski/status/1301950673286836224) that
“unloading students onto home communities” was “deeply unethical.”

As outbreaks bloom from illegal student parties and the virus spreads
through the dorms, colleges are [the new meatpacking
plants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/27/magazine/coronavirus-nebraska-unemployment-jobs.html).

## Hacking virtual learning

This school year already [looked
different](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/us/virtual-return-to-school-covid.html)
— instead of buses and homeroom, it’s Zoom rooms and social distanced
desks. Now, [even virtual spaces are feeling
precarious](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/school-districts-cyberattacks-glitches.html).

Administrators in Hartford, Conn., had prepared for a hybrid
[reopening](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/schools-reopening-coronavirus.html)
on Tuesday. But a [ransomware
attack](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/09/technology/ransomware-attacks.html)
— in which hackers locked people out of their networks and demanded big
payments to get back in — forced the district to postpone classes for
nearly 18,000 students. Schools [reopened
Wednesday](https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-ransomware-schools-20200908-zaq4q6n3pza47i4p6lv5lfefm4-story.html).

That’s not an isolated incident. Technology problems hindered [200,000
students in
Houston](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/education-news/2020/09/08/381355/back-to-school-begins-with-website-crash-for-houston-students-and-teachers/)
and thousands more in Virginia Beach. Kids can’t log on to supposedly
secure portals. Video chats kick them out. Computers stall. Error
messages multiply. Systems overload.

There were glitches and attacks well before Labor Day. There was a
[server
issue](https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/09/03/philadelphia-school-district-hoping-for-smoother-day-following-technical-glitches-on-first-day-of-virtual-learning/)
in Philadelphia. A [statewide
outage](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/education/article245014230.html)
in North Carolina. A [teenage
hacker](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/miami-dade-school-cyberattack.html)
choked the nation’s fourth-largest school district, Miami-Dade County,
for days.

Even without hacks, [students struggle to
concentrate](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/learning/school-hopes-concerns.html).
Those with learning challenges have an even harder time. Younger
children and children with special needs miss crucial social and
emotional development socializing on Zoom. Kids starting new schools
don’t know how to make friends. And lower-income children may not have
reliable internet or device access in the first
place.

school district. His dedication to the “babies,” his 48,000 students,

## Tests for kids? Good luck

As many parents have discovered, [getting a kid tested for Covid-19 is
no easy
task](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/upshot/children-testing-shortfalls-virus.html).
Even in large cities with many test sites, parents are spending hours on
the phone and driving long distances to get their kids swabbed.

Sarah Kliff, an investigative reporter at The Times, started looking
into the issue after an outbreak at her son’s day care center. “I just
assumed, because I live in a large city with a lot of testing sites,
that it would be easy,” she
said.

### School Reopenings ›

#### Back to School

Updated Sept. 11, 2020

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.

  -   - School officials in Des Moines are refusing to hold in-person
        classes, [despite an order from Iowa’s governor and a judge’s
        ruling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/des-moines-school-opening-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup),
        risking school funding and their jobs because they think it’s
        unsafe.
      - The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had one of the
        most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus
        under control. But it [failed to account for students
        partying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/health/university-illinois-covid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).
      - College students are [using apps to shame their
        schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/technology/coronavirus-quarantines-college.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup) into
        better coronavirus plans.
      - For some families, the pandemic [has meant a return to their
        native
        languages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/parenting/family-second-language-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).

Working with our colleague Margot Sanger-Katz, and with help from the
readers of this newsletter, Sarah found shortfalls across the country.

In Florida, the division of emergency management announced last month
that it would “prioritize” pediatric testing as students there began to
return to in-person school. Still, only a quarter of the [60 testing
sites](https://www.floridadisaster.org/news-media/news/20200803-state-of-florida-prioritizes-symptomatic-vulnerable-and-pediatric-populations-at-state-supported-covid-19-testing-sites/)
the agency supports will see children of all ages. The state’s 18
drive-through sites are limited to patients 5 and older.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some cities, like Los Angeles, offer public testing to anyone. But
others, like San Francisco and Dallas, have age cutoffs. In part, that’s
because of differences in health insurance and concerns about medical
privacy. The challenge of administering an invasive test to squirming
children also plays a
role.

“Kids weren’t really out in the wider world when this whole testing
infrastructure was set up,” Sarah said. “But now they are. Day cares are
reopening. Some students are going to school in person. We don’t really
have a testing infrastructure meant to handle that.”

Limited pediatric testing might stall a return to normalcy. Without
