Cases of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/schools-reopening-coronavirus.html}{coronavirus}
are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/06/us/colleges-coronavirus-students.html}{spiking
on university campuses}, leaving administrators with two unappealing
options: Quarantine students in dorms, or send them home.

The University of Alabama said it had recently posted university police
officers at its quarantine dorms while Notre Dame said it had
\href{https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/education/notre-dame-hires-more-security-after-students-placed-in-quarantine-violate-rules/article_a9c04f36-e70a-11ea-a52e-e74b0cf9b0f3.html?utm_source=Iterable\&utm_medium=email\&utm_campaign=campaign_1481931_nl_Daily-Briefing_date_20200831\&cid=db\&source=ams\&sourceId=5289649}{hired
guards} to monitor students in quarantine in hotels and off-campus
apartments. And perhaps unsurprisingly, many schools
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/22/nyregion/coronavirus-tiktok-college-quarantine-food.html}{are
having trouble} running what are essentially disease containment units.

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brianna Hayes was
assigned to a quarantine dorm after developing a fever. Two days later,
the university informed her that she had tested positive and would need
to move again, to a Covid-19 isolation dorm.

There was no university staff in the dorm to help sick students, Ms.
Hayes said, and no elevator. Feverish and exhausted from the virus, she
made four trips up and down staircases to move her bedding and other
belongings to her isolation room. During her week in isolation, she
said, no one from the university came to check on her.

``I felt like everyone was only interested in how I was affecting
others, like who I came in contact with, and then I was just left to be
sick,''
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/business/colleges-coronavirus-dormitories-quarantine.html}{she
told our colleague Natasha Singer}.

As our sister newsletter
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/briefing/astrazeneca-california-wildfires-justice-department-your-wednesday-briefing.html}{The
Morning} noted, the alternative to quarantine dorms may be even worse:
Sending potentially sick students back home, where they may spread the
virus. ``It's the worst thing you could do,'' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the
federal government's leading infectious disease expert,
\href{https://www.today.com/video/dr-anthony-fauci-predicts-safe-and-effective-vaccine-by-end-of-2020-91005509862}{said
on the ``Today'' show}.

Susan Dynarski, a University of Michigan economist,
\href{https://twitter.com/dynarski/status/1301950673286836224}{wrote on
Twitter} that ``unloading students onto home communities'' was ``deeply
unethical.''

As outbreaks bloom from illegal student parties and the virus spreads
through the dorms, colleges are

This school year already

different} --- instead of buses and homeroom, it's Zoom rooms and social

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/school-districts-cyberattacks-glitches.html}{even

Administrators in Hartford, Conn., had prepared for a hybrid

on Tuesday. But a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/09/technology/ransomware-attacks.html}{ransomware
attack} --- in which hackers locked people out of their networks and
demanded big payments to get back in --- forced the district to postpone
classes for nearly 18,000 students. Schools

Wednesday}.

That's not an isolated incident. Technology problems hindered
\href{https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/education-news/2020/09/08/381355/back-to-school-begins-with-website-crash-for-houston-students-and-teachers/}{200,000
students in Houston} and thousands more in Virginia Beach. Kids can't
log on to supposedly secure portals. Video chats kick them out.
Computers stall. Error messages multiply. Systems overload.

There were glitches and attacks well before Labor Day. There was a
\href{https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/09/03/philadelphia-school-district-hoping-for-smoother-day-following-technical-glitches-on-first-day-of-virtual-learning/}{server

County, for days.

Even without hacks,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/learning/school-hopes-concerns.html}{students
struggle to concentrate}. Those with learning challenges have an even
harder time. Younger children and children with special needs miss
crucial social and emotional development socializing on Zoom. Kids
starting new schools don't know how to make friends. And lower-income
children may not have reliable internet or device access in the first
place.

``I am at the point where I will have to let them fail Spanish, P.E. and

full-time job,'' said Ally Fonte, a parent whose two sons attend school

As many parents have discovered,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/upshot/children-testing-shortfalls-virus.html}{getting
a kid tested for Covid-19 is no easy task}. Even in large cities with
many test sites, parents are spending hours on the phone and driving
long distances to get their kids swabbed.

Sarah Kliff, an investigative reporter at The Times, started looking
into the issue after an outbreak at her son's day care center. ``I just
assumed, because I live in a large city with a lot of testing sites,
that it would be easy,'' she said.

\end{itemize}

Working with our colleague Margot Sanger-Katz, and with help from the
readers of this newsletter, Sarah found shortfalls across the country.

In Florida, the division of emergency management announced last month
that it would ``prioritize'' pediatric testing as students there began
to return to in-person school. Still, only a quarter of the
\href{https://www.floridadisaster.org/news-media/news/20200803-state-of-florida-prioritizes-symptomatic-vulnerable-and-pediatric-populations-at-state-supported-covid-19-testing-sites/}{60
testing sites} the agency supports will see children of all ages. The
state's 18 drive-through sites are limited to patients 5 and older.

Some cities, like Los Angeles, offer public testing to anyone. But
others, like San Francisco and Dallas, have age cutoffs. In part, that's
because of differences in health insurance and concerns about medical
privacy. The challenge of administering an invasive test to squirming
children also plays a role.

Brown late last month.~Credit...Elaine Thompson/Associated Press

``Kids weren't really out in the wider world when this whole testing
infrastructure was set up,'' Sarah said. ``But now they are. Day cares
are reopening. Some students are going to school in person. We don't
really have a testing infrastructure meant to handle that.''

Limited pediatric testing might stall a return to normalcy. Without
reliable testing, schools and day care centers cannot quickly isolate
and trace the virus following an outbreak.

\emph{Margot and Sarah also wanted to thank everyone who wrote in to our
call-out last week. Their story would not have been possible without
your thoughtful, candid reflections.}
