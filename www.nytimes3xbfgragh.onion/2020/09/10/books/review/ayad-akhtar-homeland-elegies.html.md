**HOMELAND ELEGIES**  
By Ayad Akhtar

The city of Abbottabad, in the former North-West Frontier Province of
Pakistan, was named after James Abbott, a 19th-century British Army
officer and player in the “Great Game,” the power struggle in Central
Asia between the British and Russian Empires. Today it’s perhaps best
known as the garrison town that sheltered Osama bin Laden before he was
[discovered and summarily
executed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2011/05/02/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-is-killed.html)
by American Special Forces in 2011. When the narrator of Ayad Akhtar’s
moving and confrontational novel “Homeland Elegies” goes there with his
father in 2008 to visit relatives, he gets a lecture from his uncle
about the tactical genius of 9/11, and his vision of a Muslim community
based on principles espoused by the Prophet Muhammad and his companions,
one that “does not bifurcate its military and political aspirations.”

The narrator, like Akhtar, is an American-born dramatist, whose own
politics have been formed by a childhood in suburban Milwaukee and a
liberal arts education. While he disagrees with his uncle, sitting in
the man’s Raj-era bungalow with William Morris wallpaper, the narrator
finds it easiest to listen without giving an opinion. His father, a
staunch American patriot and future Trump voter, is enraged. “Trust me,”
he snaps on the taxi ride home, “you don’t have a clue how terrible your
life would have been if I’d stayed here.”

The political complexities of Abbottabad are inseparable from the
tensions within the narrator’s family, and this fraught visit is just
one of a cascade of scenes and stories that vibrate with the stressful
contradictions of an American Muslim life. Like Akhtar’s dramas
(“[Disgraced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2012/10/23/theater/reviews/disgraced-by-ayad-akhtar-with-aasif-mandvi.html),”
“The Invisible Hand”), “Homeland Elegies” deals in ambiguities that were
beyond the pale of public discourse in the years after 9/11. The many
unacknowledged failures of American policy and the coarsening of popular
attitudes form the matrix in which Akhtar’s stories grow. He has an
unerring sense for the sore spots, the bitter truths that have emerged
from this history.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At one point, the narrator identifies as part of the “Muslim world,”
noting that “despite our ill usage at the hands of the American empire,
the defiling of America-as-symbol enacted on that fateful Tuesday in
September would only bring home anew to all the profundity of that
symbol’s power.” Then, in the same paragraph, he switches, to “speak as
an American” of how “the world looked to us … to uphold a holy image, or
as holy as it gets in this age of enlightenment.” The paradox is that
only people who see the United States as “the earthly garden, the
abundant idyll” would have such a jealous compulsion to destroy it. On
either side of the ideological one-way mirror, the spectacle of American
exceptionalism mesmerizes.

“Homeland Elegies” is presented as a novel, Akhtar’s second, but often
reads like a series of personal essays, each one illustrating yet
another intriguing facet of the narrator’s prismatic identity. Like all
autofiction, it induces the slightly prurient *frisson* of “truthiness,”
the genre’s signature affect. The narrator, like Akhtar, has won a
Pulitzer Prize for drama. What other parts are “true”? The syphilis? The
sudden windfall from shady investments? We are given a portrait of a
writer in the round, a sophisticated observer who is also a newly minted
member of the cultural elite, a little dazzled by the bright lights but
eager to heap his plate at the sexual and financial buffet. For a while,
he hobnobs with celebrities and billionaires, imagining that he is
“penning a coruscating catalog of the new aristocracy.” Eventually he
realizes that he is nothing more than a “neoliberal courtier.”

The narrator finds himself thinking of Walt Whitman, and in particular
the poet’s claims to be able to express through his “[simple separate
person](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48857/ones-self-i-sing)”
some kind of collective American experience. “My tongue, too, is
homegrown,” Akhtar writes, “every atom of this blood formed of this
soil, this air. But these multitudes will not be my own.” “Homeland
Elegies” is about being denied membership to the Whitmanian crowd, a
wound inflicted by 9/11 that has been painful for many American Muslims,
particularly those who feel “at home,” or assumed they were, or aspired
to be. The elegies of Akhtar’s title are sung for a dream of national
belonging that has only receded since
2001.

The reader’s experience of the book is one of fragmentation. Akhtar
tells stories that fracture and ramify and negate. Sometimes they’re
comic, like the visit to an absurd Sufi ceremony led by an Austrian
heiress. Sometimes they’re wrenchingly tragic. The narrator’s 9/11 tale
is one of abjection: He wets himself in terror after being harassed by
an Islamophobic man as he waits to give blood at St. Vincent’s Hospital
in the West Village. To protect himself from further attacks, he steals
a crucifix pendant from a Salvation Army store and wears it for several
months, a camouflage that carries more than a tint of cultural shame.
His Pakistani-American girlfriend is shocked when he confesses, years
later. She could never wear a cross. “We bought flags,” she says.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The book’s most memorable creation (or re-creation) is the narrator’s
father, a larger-than-life figure whose most cherished memory is of the
time he spent as Donald Trump’s doctor. He is a “great fan of America”
who keeps a copy of “The Art of the Deal” in the living room, “an imam’s
son whose only sacred names … were those of the big California cabernets
he adored.” The family fortunes rise and fall as he wastes the money he
makes as a cardiologist on Trumpian real estate scheming. Finally, after
a series of personal and professional disasters, his bluster fades, and
his son concludes that “he thinks he’s American, but what that really
means is that he still *wants* to be American. He still doesn’t really
feel like one.”

Akhtar arranges people and situations with a dramatist’s care to expose
the fault lines where community or communication cracks. Sometimes, the
pieces seem almost too carefully arranged. A Pennsylvania state trooper
stops the narrator and engages him in a probing conversation about
Lawrence Wright’s “[The Looming
Tower](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2006/08/01/books/01kaku.html).”
A cosmopolitan aunt, a university teacher of critical theory who makes
her young nephew read Fanon and Edward Said, draws the line at “The
Satanic Verses.”

The unease reaches a high pitch with the narrator’s trip to Los Angeles
to take meetings after he wins the Pulitzer. A Black Republican film
agent explains what he considers to be the fundamentally Jewish
character of Hollywood, “founded by families from New York’s garment
district,” who value “novelty, ephemerality, single use, mass
production.” The agent tells the narrator that if he wants to get hired,
he needs, as a Muslim, to “find ways to let them know up front that
you’re not coming for them. … Israel, the rest of it.” The narrator
splutters that “my favorite writers are all Jewish.” The absurdity of
this, essentially a version of “Some of my best friends are Black,” is
like that of a punchline in a brilliant but queasy racial farce, one
written to make the audience look away, and wonder when they’ll be able
to leave the theater.
