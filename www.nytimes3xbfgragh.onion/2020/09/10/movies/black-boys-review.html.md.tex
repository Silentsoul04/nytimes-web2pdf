\section{`Black Boys' Review: Young Lives in the
Balance}\label{black-boys-review-young-lives-in-the-balance}}

This documentary addresses the dehumanization of Black boys by
attempting the reverse: reconstructing them to show they are worth the
care they are denied.

Peacock film} ``Black Boys'' examines the beauty of Black boys but
suffers from a failure to police its own gaze.

Split into four sections --- Body, Mind, Voice and Heart --- the
documentary addresses the dehumanization of Black boys by attempting the
reverse: reconstructing them from these parts to show they are worth the
care and respect they're systematically denied in America.

Sports is the film's entry, though the subject is mostly forgotten after
it is broached. We begin with the former pro-football player Greg
Scruggs, who returns to his hometown. The film then segues into
discussing the trap of professional sports, and the commodification of
Black bodies.

The Mind section looks at the topic of education through a Black charter
school, Voice reflects on protests, and Heart discusses emotional
vulnerability, with the journalist Jemele Hill, the basketball player
Carmelo Anthony and others appearing as talking heads.

The director, Sonia Lowman, takes a commendable poetic approach. In one
arresting scene, intercut with violent clashes from a football game, a
dancer moves through a cotton field.

Lowman, who is white, is aware of her gaze. She appears on-screen as a
Black boy tells her about the racist reactions of white women who see
him.

And yet Lowman overcorrects. She indulges in metaphors (a boy compares
himself to an eagle and we see one soar through the sky) and lingers on
the faces of unnamed boys as though they're objects to stare at, as
though one long glance will illustrate a humanity that its audience is
blind to. Despite trying so hard to prove the worth of Black boys, the
film makes anonymous examples of them. (There are triggering images, too
--- police brutality, lynchings --- used without enough context to make
them warranted.)

``Black Boys'' does have moments of joy, like when three friends take
playful shots at each other during their interview, but these moments
work when the film's gaze is subdued, when it just lets Black boys be
boys.
