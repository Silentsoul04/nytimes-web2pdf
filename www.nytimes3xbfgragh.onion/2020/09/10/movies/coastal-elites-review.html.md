Legend has it that shortly after Shakespeare premiered “Macbeth,”
London’s theaters were shuttered by plague. Four centuries later, the
playwright and screenwriter Paul Rudnick’s “Coastal Elites,” [arriving
on HBO Sept. 12](https://www.hbo.com/specials/coastal-elites), has
embraced the soliloquy as the defining art form of the era of social
distance, where we poor players strut and fret our hours on the webcam.

With the director Jay Roach, Rudnick rejiggered five monologues
originally intended to be performed live at the Public Theater into
intimacies delivered straight to the lens as if venting to a therapist
on Zoom. As it was for the Bard, the topic is the tyrant king whose
outrages have pushed a Queens public-school teacher named Miriam (Bette
Midler) into madness. Midler’s scene is set in a police station, a hint
that even her character’s witty self-awareness about cultured women like
her, who signify their opinion on their tote bags, has its limits. (As
does the camera, which Miriam leans into urgently, distorting her face
as she describes ripping off a man’s MAGA hat and racing to the
sanctuary of a theater, as though she’s Quasimodo atop Notre Dame.) Has
she become the monster?

That question also haunts Mark (Daniel Levy), an actor guilt-stricken
that he played into stereotypes in his audition for a gay superhero,
while Clarissa (Sarah Paulson), an online mindfulness coach whose
serenity is as phony as her bucolic green screen backdrops wonders if
she’s wrong to walk away from her conservative family. Issa Rae delights
in the most fantastical piece as a billionaire’s daughter dragged to the
White House where, in the Lincoln Bedroom, her former boarding school
classmate — described as both “the Blonde Cloud” and “a 4-year-old in
the Haunted Mansion” — enlists her to rebrand her image in New York
society.

To cap these clever, spartan stories, “Coastal Elites” closes with a
plain-spoken address from Kaitlyn Dever, playing a nurse who’s just
wrapped a 14-hour shift at Mount Sinai. “If you start crying, you’ll
never stop,” she says. Her sigh holds no fury, but signifies everything.

**Coastal Elites**  
Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 27 minutes. [Watch on
HBO](https://www.hbomax.com/).
