\section{`Red, White \& Wasted' Review: Dirty
Driving}\label{red-white--wasted-review-dirty-driving}}

A beloved swampland subculture is under threat in this raucous yet
melancholy documentary.

Like a nature documentary ogling the strange habits of an endangered
species, ``Red, White \& Wasted'' takes us to Orlando, Fla., where the
revered pastime known as mudding is in danger of becoming extinct.

Or at least so regulated that it's no longer fun. Time was that anyone
with a monster truck, a brew and a few barely clothed babes could frolic
unharassed in Swamp Ghost, a popular mudhole that closed in 2017 after a
brush fire. That tragedy haunts Matthew Burns, our sad-eyed guide.

``Mud is like a drug to me,'' he confesses, eyeing the collection of VHS
tapes containing his filmed memories of decades of mudding. His wife
divorced him over his habit, and now he dumpster dives for scrap metal
to support his two daughters and an imminent grandchild.

Distracted by Confederate flags and twerking women, the directors,
Andrei Bowden Schwartz and Sam Jones, make only a halfhearted attempt to
illuminate a disappearing subculture. Depending on your viewpoint, their
efforts might arouse envy or horror; but for all the beer cans colliding
with foreheads, there's an insistent sadness here that muffles the
ubiquitous bigotry. Mudding, it seems, is just one more thing being
taken from people who have very little to begin with.

Filmed from 2015-19, ``Red, White \& Wasted'' is mostly a gawking
portrait of getting together and getting trashed. Late in the film, we
accompany Burns to a terrifying event known as the Redneck Yacht Club,
where pallid, mud-loving partyers chug and howl. Aiming his camera at
drunken brawls and jiggling behinds, Burns seems dazed, yet content.

``I like it,'' he nods, smiling.
