Major League Baseball will play most of its postseason at neutral sites
for the first time, with the World Series to be held this October at the
Texas Rangers’ new ballpark in Arlington, Texas. While the league is
still working out details of the plan with the players’ union, the
concept and location of postseason bubbles have been decided.

Multiple people with direct knowledge of the talks confirmed the plans
on condition of anonymity because no formal agreement has been reached.

The Rangers, who were 15-27 through Wednesday, are almost certain not to
qualify for the playoffs, which would make Globe Life Field a true
neutral site. The park, which stands beside the Dallas Cowboys’ AT\&T
Stadium and reportedly cost more than $1.1 billion to build, opened in
July and has a retractable roof and artificial turf.

It would become the first stadium to host the entire World Series since
1944, when Sportsman’s Park in St. Louis hosted both the Cardinals and
the Browns. The Polo Grounds also hosted both of its tenants — the
Yankees and the New York Giants — for each game of the 1921 and 1922
World Series.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The regular season, shortened to 60 games this year because of the
coronavirus pandemic, will end on Sept. 27. The league and the
union[agreed to an expanded playoff
format](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/sports/baseball/mlb-playoffs.html)
this season that will begin with eight best-of-three series, with teams
seeded 1 through 8 in each league.

M.L.B. expects those series to take place at the home parks of the
higher-seeded teams, partly to incentivize teams to play hard through
the end of the regular season. After the first round, though, the
postseason would shift to neutral sites: two ballparks in Southern
California — M.L.B. could choose among Los Angeles, Anaheim and San
Diego — for the American League division series and League Championship
Series, and the Texas ballparks — in Arlington and Houston — for the
National League series.

One issue holding up an official announcement is the health and safety
protocols regarding players’ families. The Athletic
[reported](https://theathletic.com/2055982/2020/09/09/rosenthal-dodgers-push-back-on-proposed-family-restrictions-for-the-postseason/)that
M.L.B. is pushing a requirement that the players’ family members must
quarantine for seven days before joining any of the
bubbles.

### The Coronavirus Outbreak

#### Sports and the Virus

Updated Sept. 11, 2020

Here’s what’s happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to
life:

  -   - Baseball plans to [hold its playoff
        games](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/sports/baseball/mlb-postseason-neutral-sites.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) at
        four stadiums in Southern California and Texas, with the World
        Series held at the Texas Rangers’ new ballpark.
      - N.F.L. teams have spent years trying to create over-the-top
        entertainment for fans inside stadiums. This year, they’ll just
        be [trying to cover up
        echoes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/sports/football/what-will-nfl-games-sound-like.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) from
        empty seats.
      - September Saturdays at Penn State are usually the apex of a week
        of hype. Now, as at other college football destinations, the
        approach of autumn has been [unusually
        quiet](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/sports/penn-state-college-football-canceled.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_2&context=storylines_keepup) there.

“We finish the last week of our season at home. I’d be at my house with
my wife,” Justin Turner, the Dodgers’ union representative, told the
website. “Then they’re like, ‘We’ve got to separate you guys.’ I don’t
understand why she would be quarantined. I lived with her the whole
season.”

Dr. Gary Green, baseball’s medical director, said last month that
keeping postseason teams in contained environments would be sensible,
cutting down on travel and limiting the risk of exposure to the virus.
After the best-of-three rounds, just eight teams will be remaining —
four in each state — which M.L.B. sees as a manageable number for a
bubble approach.

“If you were able to get down to a point where you had a limited number
of teams for a limited number of games, I think that type of thing could
work better,” Dr. Green [told The New York Times last
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/10/sports/baseball/rob-manfred-mlb-season-outbreaks.html).
“I think that’s certainly a lot more feasible than playing a whole
season in a bubble.”

Commissioner Rob Manfred acknowledged last month that the league was
doing “contingency planning with respect to the postseason,” which stood
to reason. With teams generating no money from ticket sales in the
regular season, the industry is counting heavily on revenue from
postseason rights fees, so the league does not want to take any chances
with those games.

For now, the best-of-three first round is in place only for this season.
It swells the overall field to 16 teams, from the usual 10, and replaces
the wild-card games that had taken place from 2012 through 2019. The top
two teams in each division would make it, along with the two teams with
the next best records in each league.

According to the standings entering play on Thursday, the A.L.
first-round matchups would be: the Yankees at Tampa Bay; Minnesota at
Oakland; Houston at the Chicago White Sox; and Toronto at Cleveland. In
the N.L., the matchups would be: Miami at Los Angeles; San Francisco at
Atlanta; St. Louis at the Chicago Cubs; and Philadelphia at San Diego.
