# N.F.L. Season Kicks Off With Players’ Protesting Racism

</div>

After an off-season of social turmoil, the Houston Texans chose not to
be on the field for the playing of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and “The
Star-Spangled Banner” before the league’s season opener in Kansas City,
Mo.

After an off-season of social and political turmoil, N.F.L. players made
it clear on the night of the season opener that they will continue to
shine a light on social injustice and police brutality against African
Americans.

The Houston Texans, who were in Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday to face
the Chiefs for the first game of the year, remained in their locker room
during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and “[Lift Every Voice
and Sing](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1304212564599955456?s=20),”
which is known as the Black national anthem. After the protests
following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in late May,
the league said the song would be played before every game in Week 1 of
the season.

The Texans stayed inside to keep the focus on systemic racism and to
avoid a debate over kneeling or standing during either or both songs.

“It’s really not about the flag, it’s about making sure that people
understand that Black lives do matter,” Texans Coach Bill O’Brien said
after the game.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Chiefs lined up along their sideline while “The Star-Spangled
Banner” played. One player, defensive end [Alex
Okafor](https://www.chiefs.com/team/players-roster/alex-okafor/), knelt
and raised an arm. A teammate put his hand on Okafor’s shoulder. Many
other players linked arms.

After the anthem was played, the Texans ran on to the field to a
smattering of boos from the Arrowhead Stadium crowd, which had been
reduced to 22 percent capacity because of the coronavirus. Some fans
also booed [as the players linked
arms](https://twitter.com/ComplexSports/status/1304216261904281600) in
the middle of the field for a moment of silence, which Texans defensive
lineman J.J. Watt called “unfortunate.” Chiefs quarterback Patrick
Mahomes and Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, who were both outspoken
this summer about the need for change, were at the center of the line,
arms linked.

The protests at the N.F.L. opener were the latest in a wave of
demonstrations by professional athletes that began late last month with
the widespread postponement of games as players in the N.B.A., the
W.N.B.A., Major League Baseball and other leagues chose to [walk out in
response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha,
Wis.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/sports/basketball/nba-boycott-bucks-magic-blake-shooting.html)

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Even though about 70 percent of its players are Black, the N.F.L. has
wrestled for several years with how to react to player protests and
calls to address systematic racism and social injustice. The league
largely ignored quarterback Colin Kaepernick when he knelt during the
national anthem throughout the 2016 season to protest police brutality
against African Americans.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But after President Trump in September 2017 called for teams to fire
players who did not stand for the anthem, the league and its owners
tried to tamp down protests while also pledging tens of millions of
dollars to groups fighting social injustice. The league backed off
trying to ban protests during the anthem after the players’ union filed
a grievance.

Kaepernick, once considered one of the sport’s rising stars, has not
been on an N.F.L. roster since the 2016 season, and in 2017 he accused
the league of blackballing him because of his protests. The N.F.L.
agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement of the case. In November, the
league organized a tryout for Kaepernick, but the two sides could not
agree on the terms of the audition. [Kaepernick held his own
workout](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/16/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout.html)
in front of about a half-dozen scouts, but he remains unsigned.

Only a handful of players protested the past couple of seasons. But the
issue was reignited this summer with nationwide demonstrations after
Floyd’s death. In early June, Commissioner [Roger Goodell apologized for
not listening
sooner](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/sports/football/trump-anthem-kneeling-kaepernick.html)to
the concerns of African-American players. At the same time, President
Trump renewed his attacks on the league.

Broadcasters, who pay the league billions of dollars for the rights to
show games, have largely tiptoed around the protests. But in a sign of
the new attitude, Cris Collinsworth, a former player who was one of the
announcers calling Thursday’s game for NBC Sports, lent his support to
the protesters.

“I stand behind these players 100 percent. 100 percent,” he said before
kickoff. “What they’re trying to do is create positive change in this
country that frankly is long, long overdue.”

The bulk of the N.F.L. games will be on Sunday, and it is already clear
there will be more protests. About an hour before the Chiefs and Texans
kicked off, members of the Miami Dolphins took aim at the league’s
efforts to address systematic racism and said they, too, would remain in
the locker room during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” and
“Lift Every Voice and Sing.”

[In a
video](https://twitter.com/realjaywilliams/status/1304186433054420992?s=12)
they posted on Twitter, and which was first reported by ESPN, the
players said they did not appreciate the league’s empty marketing
slogans, which they called “fluff and empty gestures.”

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We don’t need another publicity parade, so we’ll just stay inside until
it’s time to play the game,” the players said, referring to their game
against the New England Patriots on Sunday.

Playing “Lift Every Voice and Sing” before games, they said, “is just a
way to save face.”

“We need changed hearts, not just a response to pressure,” they added.

The video ended with Dolphins Coach Brian Flores, who is Afro-Latino and
one of just three Black head coaches in the league, repeating the
message, “We’ll just stay inside.”

The league this summer [approved a plan for players to wear
decals](https://www.seahawks.com/news/seahawks-to-wear-helmet-decals-supporting-social-justice-initiatives-honoring-vi)
on the backs of their helmets with the names of victims of racist
violence. Teams are stenciling the words “End Racism” in the end zones,
and the N.F.L. has encouraged teams to use their stadiums as polling
centers on Election Day.

Some of the league’s biggest stars are getting messages across in
advertisements. Mahomes, who in July signed a [10-year contract worth as
much as $500
million](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/sports/football/pat-mahomes-contract.html),
[appeared in an Adidas
ad](https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes/status/1303504412242071552) in
which he said: “We’re gonna be playing sports. But at the same time
we’re gonna be taking action, and we’re gonna be making change in the
world.”

Mahomes has been a vocal supporter of voter registration initiatives and
[fighting voter
suppression](https://chiefswire.usatoday.com/2020/06/23/kansas-city-chiefs-patrick-mahomes-lebron-james-more-than-a-vote/).

Like Goodell, some N.F.L. team owners have said they support the
players’ right to protest. Last week, John Mara, co-owner of the
Giants, [said he preferred that players
stand](https://www.giants.com/news/john-mara-joe-judge-daniel-jones-saquon-barkley-jabrill-peppers-training-camp)
for the national anthem, but that he would back those who did not.

“I’m going to support your right to do that because I believe in the
First Amendment, and I believe in the right of people, especially
players, to take a knee in silent protest if that’s what they want to
do,” he said.
