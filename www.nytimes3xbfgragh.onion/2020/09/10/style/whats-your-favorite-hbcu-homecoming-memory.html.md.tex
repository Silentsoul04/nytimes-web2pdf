For students and graduates of historically Black colleges and
universities, homecoming is more than just a football game. It's an
expression of pride, culture, food, music and fashion that attracts tens
of thousands of students, graduates, celebrities, supporters and fans
each year.

Homecoming festivities at H.B.C.U.s often include a weeklong lineup of
events: pregame tailgates, football games, parades, marching bands,
galas, concerts, parties, step shows and more. But this year, the
pandemic has caused many schools around the country to cancel in-person
events.

So we invite you to share your favorite homecoming memories with us.
(After all, what would an H.B.C.U. homecoming experience be without the
memories that it creates?) Please send us a photo and/or video of your
favorite H.B.C.U. homecoming experience and the story behind it.

You may be contacted by a reporter to appear in a video about the
subject. We will also publish a selection of the responses in an
upcoming article.
