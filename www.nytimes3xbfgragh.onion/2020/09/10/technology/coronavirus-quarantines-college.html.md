*This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can* [*sign up

receive it weekdays.*

We’ve all seen [social media used to shame people we disagree
with](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/arts/social-distance-shaming.html).
Those milliseconds of tsk-tsking might feel good, but I doubt they’re
helpful.

Then my colleague [Natasha
Singer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/natasha-singer) told me
about pandemic shaming I can get behind.

College students are using TikTok, Twitter and other apps to embarrass
their
[universities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/health/university-illinois-covid.html)
when they fail to care for people who have been isolated in special
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/health/university-illinois-covid.html)
dorms or are in quarantine units because of a possible exposure.

Natasha, who wrote this week about [universities botching on-campus
quarantines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/business/colleges-coronavirus-dormitories-quarantine.html),
talked to me about how young people — often being shamed for acting
irresponsibly in the pandemic — are now turning the tables on the
grown-ups, and how colleges are sometimes over-relying on technology
that doesn’t do much to protect students.

**Shira: Tell me your tales of students using social media to shame
their schools.**

**Natasha:** Many people have seen the online videos of students stuck
in quarantine or isolation documenting [crummy or nonexistent
university-provided
meals](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/22/nyregion/coronavirus-tiktok-college-quarantine-food.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But what I found went deeper: Sick students are making videos about how
they felt universities [abandoned
them](https://dailyiowan.com/2020/08/20/i-felt-like-a-guinea-pig-students-awful-quarantine-experience-prompts-university-of-iowa-apology/)
once they tested positive and moved into special Covid dorms.

And there are a bunch of students who shared online their shock that
virus-infected students or people who were waiting for tests were
[assigned to share a
room](https://twitter.com/volkporter/status/1295899925209899009),
bathroom or
[dorm](https://twitter.com/sarahortbal/status/1298099716127895553) —
conditions that they worried could foster infections. In some cases,
their colleges then improved services for quarantined students.

**College students are also being shamed on social media for their
behavior.**

Yes, some kids are
[partying](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/more-20-nyu-students-suspended-breaking-coronavirus-rules-school-says-n1239443)
or [going to bars in large numbers without
masks](https://www.al.com/news/2020/08/this-has-to-become-a-cause-careless-partying-at-ua-leads-to-campus-restrictions.html).
But epidemiologists said some schools also made the risks worse by
failing to make systemic changes to help curtail the virus. They also
said some schools have significantly reduced occupancy in dorms, a
change that could help hinder outbreaks.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_1_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

**Sending infected students home is dangerous because it** **[risks
spreading the coronavirus to their families and
communities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/briefing/astrazeneca-california-wildfires-justice-department-your-wednesday-briefing.html).
What should colleges do?**

Public health experts say the best practice is for schools to care for
the mental and physical health of students who are quarantined, and not
leave them to fend for themselves.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many schools didn’t seem to have a plan in place to closely monitor and
care for students in isolation dorms, and hadn’t envisioned what it’s
like for an 18-year-old who gets sick and feels cut off.

**What are examples of colleges that did make useful changes?**

Tulane University has nurses on staff 24-7 in a dorm for students with
infections. The nurses deliver meals three times a day and check on
students to make sure they’re OK.

Tufts University created modular, individual isolation housing units in
a parking lot for students with virus infections. School officials said
they didn’t want to put sick students in old dorms that lacked elevators
— which might be needed to transport a student to a hospital.

**You previously reported on workplaces** **[trying to protect
employees](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/business/virus-office-workplace-return.html)**
**from the coronavirus. How are colleges acting differently or the
same?**

One similarity is that workplaces have used a lot of [unproven or iffy
technology](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/technology/coronavirus-worker-testing-privacy.html),
like fever screening devices, that make people feel safer but might not
actually do much to mitigate coronavirus risks. Universities are now
[going ahead with some of the same
technologies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/business/alabama-uab-coronavirus-tests.html),
when they could be using a more proven technique: frequent virus
testing.

## Why your wildfire photos don’t look like real life

The sky in places on the West Coast turned a [murky orange this week
because of
wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/pictures-photos-california-fires.html).
But some people said that photos they took on their phones made their
apocalyptic skies look almost normal.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

What gives? Well, digital cameras try to take snapshots that look better
than reality.

“Any camera doesn’t see exactly what the human eye sees; it’s not an
exact duplication,” [James
Estrin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/james-estrin), a staff
photographer for The New York Times, told me. Most smartphones, he said,
are “programmed to make the most pleasing photos for people, and that
usually means a bright blue sky.”

Imagine the software in your smartphone camera digesting that [eerie
orange hue](https://twitter.com/AirDistrict/status/1303746736414883840),
and figuring that is not how the sky is supposed to look. That’s why
some people were having trouble capturing how scary it looked outside
their
windows.

### School Reopenings ›

#### Back to School

Updated Sept. 11, 2020

The latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.

  -   - School officials in Des Moines are refusing to hold in-person
        classes, [despite an order from Iowa’s governor and a judge’s
        ruling](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/des-moines-school-opening-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup),
        risking school funding and their jobs because they think it’s
        unsafe.
      - The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had one of the
        most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus
        under control. But it [failed to account for students
        partying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/health/university-illinois-covid.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).
      - College students are [using apps to shame their
        schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/technology/coronavirus-quarantines-college.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup) into
        better coronavirus plans.
      - For some families, the pandemic [has meant a return to their
        native
        languages](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/parenting/family-second-language-coronavirus.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&context=storylines_keepup).

James said that most of the time, we [want cameras to tinker with our
snapshots](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/14/your-smartphone-photos-are-totally-fake-you-love-it/).
People like me who aren’t capable photographers don’t want to think
about exposure times, shutter speeds or color balance. And I want my
phone to make my photos less blurry or brighten images from a dark
restaurant. Reality is overrated.

But for people who are frustrated that their smartphones aren’t
accurately capturing what they see, there are apps like Snapseed and
Halide that let people adjust the color on their smartphone-shot photos.
(Check out these [before-and-after app-adjusted
shots](https://twitter.com/sarahfrier/status/1303706996873461760) from a
Bloomberg News journalist in San Francisco.)

James said apps like Photos included on iPhones have edit options, and
choosing “warmer” colors will restore those photos of the orange skies
to something closer to what people see with their own eyes.

“They are extraordinary cameras in general,” James said about our
smartphones. Some of his iPhone photos have been published in The Times,
too.

## Before we go …

  - **Who is responsible for workers who aren’t employees?** Uber and
    other “gig” companies classify their workers as contractors and not
    employees, leaving a legal gray area about who is responsible for
    injuries or mistreatment on the job.
    
    My colleagues Kellen Browning and Kate Conger write that a civil
    rights nonprofit is asking California regulators to step up
    protections for house cleaners who booked work through a gig app
    called Handy and said they were [sexually harassed by
    clients](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/business/handy-service-cleaners-harassment.html)
    and couldn’t get Handy to address it.

  - **He helps make sure “the babies” can do remote school:** Online
    school stinks, but the education news website The 74 has a lovely
    article about the [head of information technology for San Antonio’s
    schools](https://www.the74million.org/article/from-i-t-guy-to-mvp-the-pandemic-thrusts-san-antonio-isds-ken-thompson-into-the-center-of-the-action/).
    He helped prep teachers for remote instruction and set up a tech
    support help desk that fielded up to 1,400 calls from families on
    the first day of virtual school. He and other staff members refer to
    students, affectionately, as “the babies.”
    
    (I first read about this in The Times’s [Coronavirus Schools
    Briefing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/schools-reopening-coronavirus.html),
    which you should [sign
    up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/newsletters/coronavirus-schools-briefing)
    for\!)

  - **“We need ways to politely disconnect.”** YES, PLEASE, to this
    OneZero columnist’s plea for [universal digital “away
    messages.”](https://onezero.medium.com/now-is-the-time-to-bring-back-away-messages-d53b3fcf0af3)
    These pop-up notices, popularized by 2000s-era AOL, automatically
    notify people who are emailing, messaging and texting us that we are
    trying not to be distracted and will read all that stuff later. Or
    never.
