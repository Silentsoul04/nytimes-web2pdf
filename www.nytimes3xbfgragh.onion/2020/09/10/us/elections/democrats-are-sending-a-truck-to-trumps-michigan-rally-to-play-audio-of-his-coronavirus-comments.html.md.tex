Ahead of President Trump's rally in Michigan on Thursday night,
Democrats are planning to use his own words to skewer him.

The Democratic National Committee is dispatching a mobile billboard
truck to MBS International Airport in Freeland, Mich., where the rally
will take place. The truck will play a brief audio clip of Mr. Trump
speaking to the journalist Bob Woodward about the coronavirus: ``I
wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down.''

As his words ring out, the truck will display statistics showing the
virus's toll. The back of the truck will carry a blunt message: ``Trump
Lied. Americans Died.''

Democrats, including Joseph R. Biden Jr., have long attacked Mr. Trump
over his handling of the virus. But the president's comments to Mr.
Woodward are giving the party a new and powerful way to raise the issue.

``While Trump will continue to use these rallies to lie to the American
people,'' said Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for the D.N.C., ``we're using
his own words to remind Michigan voters that when Americans needed the
facts during this pandemic, Donald Trump lied to them, costing an untold
number of lives and causing economic devastation.''
