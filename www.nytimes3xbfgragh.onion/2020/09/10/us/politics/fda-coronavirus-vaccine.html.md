WASHINGTON — As President Trump continues to suggest a coronavirus
vaccine could be ready before Election Day, top regulators at the Food
and Drug Administration issued an unusual statement on Thursday
promising to uphold the scientific integrity of their work and defend
the agency’s independence.

In [an opinion
column](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/09/10/sound-science-to-meet-covid-challenges-fda-career-officials-column/5756948002/)
published in USA Today, eight directors of the F.D.A.’s regulatory
centers and offices warned that “if the agency’s credibility is lost
because of real or perceived interference, people will not rely on the
agency’s safety warnings.” While they did not mention Mr. Trump or other
political leaders, the context appeared clear.

“We absolutely understand that the F.D.A., like other federal executive
agencies, operates in a political environment,” they wrote. “That is a
reality that we must navigate adeptly while maintaining our independence
to ensure the best possible outcomes for public health.”

They added, “We and our career staff do the best by public health when
we are the decision makers, arriving at those decisions based on our
unbiased evaluation of the scientific evidence.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The pledge by career scientists in the federal government came amid
mounting concerns over the role the White House has played in emergency
approvals for coronavirus therapies, including convalescent plasma and
the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which the agency [later
revoked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html).

A day before plasma [received emergency
approval](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/23/us/politics/fda-plasma-coronavirus.html)
last month, Mr. Trump [accused officials at the
F.D.A.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/22/politics/trump-fda-coronavirus-vaccine/index.html)
of being part of a “deep state” — his moniker for career civil servants
he believes betray his agenda — that was deliberately slow-walking
therapies and vaccines. Top officials at the agency, including political
appointees, have been frustrated in recent weeks by comments Mr. Trump
has made about his contact with pharmaceutical companies and his efforts
to speed progress on vaccines, giving the impression the White House is
playing a regulatory role.

The statement in USA Today was written in large part because of fears
over political influence on the F.D.A., including from the White House,
according to senior administration officials familiar with the
effort.

Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, praised the statement on
Thursday, [writing on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/SteveFDA/status/1304053712940339201) that
members of the group “took the initiative to independently express their
steadfast trust in the expertise and commitment of our organization.”

“I wholeheartedly agree with them,” he said.

The specter of political arm-twisting with vaccine approvals has grown
as several drugmakers entered large late-stage trials this summer. Mr.
Trump told reporters on Monday that “we’re going to have a vaccine very
soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I’m
talking about.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That timeline, framed around Election Day, has been [widely
challenged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/science/covid-vaccine-pharma-pledge.html)
by the administration’s top health officials, who have said that a
vaccine approval by early November was improbable. Nine pharmaceutical
companies [issued a joint
pledge](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/health/9-drug-companies-pledge-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
on Tuesday that they would “stand with science” and not put forward a
vaccine until it had been thoroughly vetted for safety and efficacy.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesman, said in a statement on
Thursday that “President Trump, his administration and the scientific
community are dedicated to delivering a safe and effective vaccine as
quickly as possible while ensuring that any approvals will be based on
data and thorough medical and scientific reviews by career professionals
and an independent review board.”

“This false narrative that Democrats and some in the media are
advancing, suggesting that politics is influencing approvals, is
unconscionable and dangerous,” he said.

Polling [published on
Thursday](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2020/)
by the Kaiser Family Foundation revealed that 62 percent of Americans
are concerned that political pressure from the administration will lead
the F.D.A. to rush a vaccine approval. Four in 10 adults said that the
agency was paying “too much attention” to politics in reviewing and
issuing approvals for therapies.

The F.D.A. is still defending its decision to issue an emergency use
authorization for blood plasma at an event with the president, where Dr.
Hahn [exaggerated the effects of the
treatment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/health/fda-blood-plasma.html)
with misleading data he [walked back a day
later](https://twitter.com/SteveFDA/status/1298071619236245504?). White
House officials had repeatedly pressed senior health officials to issue
the approval.

In an interview on Thursday with the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.,
Dr. Hahn said that the “totality of evidence was in support of that
authorization.”

“I want to reassure the American people, we will revisit that decision
when we have the data that justify re-looking at it,” he said.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Hahn also refused to commit to a particular timeline for a vaccine,
saying that data from clinical trials would first be evaluated by an
independent monitoring board. When the F.D.A. reviews data, it will not
“cut corners,” he said.

“I don’t have a crystal ball here,” he said. “It would be really
inappropriate for me to speculate, because, again, we haven’t seen the
clinical data.”

Asked whether the F.D.A. commissioner had the independence needed under
the law, Dr. Hahn promised that the agency would “independently call the
balls and strikes on medical products” and would lean on its career
scientists.

Dr. Hahn has also [publicly
committed](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200814.996612/full/)
to vet any vaccine approval through an advisory committee of outside
experts, who typically review clinical trial data before a new vaccine
is approved.

Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A.’s top vaccine regulator and one of the
authors of the USA Today column,[reiterated in an online
event](https://twitter.com/walidgellad/status/1304094686693425152) on
Thursday sponsored by Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health
Policy that an emergency authorization for a limited part of the
population would first go to such an advisory committee.
