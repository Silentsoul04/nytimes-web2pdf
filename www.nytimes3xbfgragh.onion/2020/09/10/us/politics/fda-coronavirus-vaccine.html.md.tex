Pressure}\label{fda-regulators-publish-rare-self-defense-amid-rising-vaccine-pressure}}

A group of career scientists at the Food and Drug Administration vowed
that their work would continue unimpeded and independent of political
influence.

WASHINGTON --- As President Trump continues to suggest a coronavirus
vaccine could be ready before Election Day, top regulators at the Food
and Drug Administration issued an unusual statement on Thursday
promising to uphold the scientific integrity of their work and defend
the agency's independence.

In
\href{https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/09/10/sound-science-to-meet-covid-challenges-fda-career-officials-column/5756948002/}{an
opinion column} published in USA Today, eight directors of the F.D.A.'s
regulatory centers and offices warned that ``if the agency's credibility
is lost because of real or perceived interference, people will not rely
on the agency's safety warnings.'' While they did not mention Mr. Trump
or other political leaders, the context appeared clear.

``We absolutely understand that the F.D.A., like other federal executive
agencies, operates in a political environment,'' they wrote. ``That is a
reality that we must navigate adeptly while maintaining our independence
to ensure the best possible outcomes for public health.''

They added, ``We and our career staff do the best by public health when
we are the decision makers, arriving at those decisions based on our
unbiased evaluation of the scientific evidence.''

The pledge by career scientists in the federal government came amid
mounting concerns over the role the White House has played in emergency
approvals for coronavirus therapies, including convalescent plasma and
the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which the agency
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html}{later
revoked}.

A day before plasma
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/23/us/politics/fda-plasma-coronavirus.html}{received
emergency approval} last month, Mr. Trump
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/22/politics/trump-fda-coronavirus-vaccine/index.html}{accused
officials at the F.D.A.} of being part of a ``deep state'' --- his
moniker for career civil servants he believes betray his agenda --- that
was deliberately slow-walking therapies and vaccines. Top officials at
the agency, including political appointees, have been frustrated in
recent weeks by comments Mr. Trump has made about his contact with
pharmaceutical companies and his efforts to speed progress on vaccines,
giving the impression the White House is playing a regulatory role.

The statement in USA Today was written in large part because of fears
over political influence on the F.D.A., including from the White House,
according to senior administration officials familiar with the effort.

Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, praised the statement on
Thursday,
\href{https://twitter.com/SteveFDA/status/1304053712940339201}{writing
on Twitter} that members of the group ``took the initiative to
independently express their steadfast trust in the expertise and
commitment of our organization.''

``I wholeheartedly agree with them,'' he said.

The specter of political arm-twisting with vaccine approvals has grown
as several drugmakers entered large late-stage trials this summer. Mr.
Trump told reporters on Monday that ``we're going to have a vaccine very
soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I'm
talking about.''

That timeline, framed around Election Day, has been
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/science/covid-vaccine-pharma-pledge.html}{widely
challenged} by the administration's top health officials, who have said
that a vaccine approval by early November was improbable. Nine
pharmaceutical companies
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/health/9-drug-companies-pledge-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{issued
a joint pledge} on Tuesday that they would ``stand with science'' and
not put forward a vaccine until it had been thoroughly vetted for safety
and efficacy.

Brian Morgenstern, a White House spokesman, said in a statement on
Thursday that ``President Trump, his administration and the scientific
community are dedicated to delivering a safe and effective vaccine as
quickly as possible while ensuring that any approvals will be based on
data and thorough medical and scientific reviews by career professionals
and an independent review board.''

``This false narrative that Democrats and some in the media are
advancing, suggesting that politics is influencing approvals, is
unconscionable and dangerous,'' he said.

Polling
\href{https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2020/}{published
on Thursday} by the Kaiser Family Foundation revealed that 62 percent of
Americans are concerned that political pressure from the administration
will lead the F.D.A. to rush a vaccine approval. Four in 10 adults said
that the agency was paying ``too much attention'' to politics in
reviewing and issuing approvals for therapies.

The F.D.A. is still defending its decision to issue an emergency use
authorization for blood plasma at an event with the president, where Dr.
Hahn
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/health/fda-blood-plasma.html}{exaggerated
the effects of the treatment} with misleading data he
\href{https://twitter.com/SteveFDA/status/1298071619236245504?}{walked
back a day later}. White House officials had repeatedly pressed senior
health officials to issue the approval.

In an interview on Thursday with the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.,
Dr. Hahn said that the ``totality of evidence was in support of that
authorization.''

``I want to reassure the American people, we will revisit that decision
when we have the data that justify re-looking at it,'' he said.

Dr. Hahn also refused to commit to a particular timeline for a vaccine,
saying that data from clinical trials would first be evaluated by an
independent monitoring board. When the F.D.A. reviews data, it will not
``cut corners,'' he said.

``I don't have a crystal ball here,'' he said. ``It would be really
inappropriate for me to speculate, because, again, we haven't seen the
clinical data.''

Asked whether the F.D.A. commissioner had the independence needed under
the law, Dr. Hahn promised that the agency would ``independently call
the balls and strikes on medical products'' and would lean on its career
scientists.

Dr. Hahn has also
\href{https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200814.996612/full/}{publicly
committed} to vet any vaccine approval through an advisory committee of
outside experts, who typically review clinical trial data before a new
vaccine is approved.

Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A.'s top vaccine regulator and one of the
authors of the USA Today
column,\href{https://twitter.com/walidgellad/status/1304094686693425152}{reiterated
in an online event} on Thursday sponsored by Duke University's Margolis
Center for Health Policy that an emergency authorization for a limited
part of the population would first go to such an advisory committee.
