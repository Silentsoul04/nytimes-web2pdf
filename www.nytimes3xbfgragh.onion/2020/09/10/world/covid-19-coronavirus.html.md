## A new study warns the virus is ‘a life-threatening disease in people of all ages.’

The coronavirus may be best known for the brutal toll it has taken on
older adults, but a new study of hospital patients challenges the notion
that young people are impervious.

The [research letter from
Harvard](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2770542?guestAccessKey=87e8344a-8e2f-4ca8-8e1a-95be53bbf71e&utm_source=silverchair&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=article_alert-jamainternalmedicine&utm_content=olf&utm_term=090920)
found that among 3,222 young adults hospitalized with Covid-19, 88 died
— about 2.7 percent. One in five required intensive care, and one in
10 needed a ventilator to assist with breathing.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Among those who survived, 99 patients, or 3 percent, could not be sent
home from the hospital and were transferred to facilities for ongoing
care or rehabilitation.

The study “establishes that Covid-19 is a life-threatening disease in
people of all ages,” wrote Dr. Mitchell Katz, a deputy editor at JAMA
Internal Medicine, [in an accompanying
editorial](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2770541?guestAccessKey=8633865c-3c11-4ce2-9449-887ca6580677&utm_source=silverchair&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=article_alert-jamainternalmedicine&utm_content=olf&utm_term=090920).

“Social distancing, facial coverings and other approaches to prevent
transmission are as important in young adults as in older people,” it
said.

Nearly 60 percent of younger patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were
men, and a similar percentage were Black or Hispanic. Men were more
likely to need a ventilator than women, and more likely to die. Extreme
obesity and hypertension were also linked to a greater risk of
mechanical ventilation or death.

The study, which was peer reviewed and published in JAMA Internal
Medicine on Wednesday, looked at young adults discharged from more than
400 hospitals in the United States between April 1 and June 30. Over
all, just over one-third were obese, and one quarter extremely so.
Roughly one in five had diabetes, and about one in seven had
hypertension.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The senior author of the research letter, Dr. Scott D. Solomon, a
professor of medicine at Harvard, emphasized that despite the rise in
coronavirus cases among young people, the proportion who become so sick
that they require hospitalization remains low.

At the same time, he said, some will become seriously ill, and Black and
Hispanic people are overrepresented among them.

“We talk a lot about how young people can transmit the disease to others
who are more vulnerable, but we want to make the point that some young
people — it’s not a huge number compared to those getting infected — but
a finite number are going to have serious consequences of this disease,”
Dr. Solomon said.

Those with chronic health problems are at greater risk, but some with no
apparent vulnerabilities also become acutely ill, he said.

“There are factors that we don’t understand that put people at risk with
this disease,” Dr. Solomon said. “They may be genetic, they may be
environmental, they may be the other viruses we’ve been exposed to in
our lives. There is a randomness there.”

And researchers know very little about the long-term consequences for
the young adults who recover. “What are the effects they are going to
have weeks, months, even years down the line?” Dr. Solomon
asked.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A near-united front by Republicans. En masse opposition by Democrats.
And when the vote by the Senate was over Thursday, the conclusion was
just as foregone as anyone might have imaged: The Republicans’ so-called
skinny stimulus plan went down.

The failure of the measure to advance spoke to the rapidly dwindling
chances that Congress will enact another recovery measure to ease the
economic toll of the pandemic before November’s elections.

After months of struggling to overcome deep internal divisions over the
scope of another relief package, Republicans put the pared-down bill
forward knowing it was almost certainly going nowhere. It needed 60
votes to advance — and Democrats, who says the measure is far too
stingy, were not inclined to oblige.

Republicans held the vote largely because it allowed them to foist blame
on Democrats for the lack of progress on a compromise stimulus bill.

“They can tell American families they care more about politics than
helping them,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the
majority leader. “Senators who want to move forward will vote yes. They
will vote to advance this process so they can shape it into a bipartisan
product and make a law for the American people.”

The 52-47 vote was mostly along party lines, with Democrats uniformly in
opposition and one Republican, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, joining
them in seeking to block the measure from advancing.

The Republican plan slashed hundreds of billions of dollars from their
original $1 trillion proposal unveiled in July. It included federal aid
for unemployed workers, small businesses, schools and vaccine
development.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Democrats, who have refused to accept any proposal less than $2.2
trillion, argued that it did little to address the economic devastation
of the pandemic.

The measure did not include another round of stimulus checks for
taxpayers or aid to state and local governments facing financial ruin,
omissions that cut down the overall price tag of the legislation in a
bid to appease fiscal conservatives.

And while it would have revived weekly federal jobless benefits that
lapsed at the end of July, it set them at $300 — half the original
amount. Democrats are pressing to reinstitute the full payment.

“This bill is not going to happen because it is so emaciated, so filled
with poison pills — it is designed to fail,” said Senator Chuck Schumer
of New York, the minority leader, on the Senate floor. “It’s
insufficient. It’s completely inadequate.”

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been a point man in
negotiations with Democrats on a recovery package, cast doubt Wednesday
on whether any agreement could be reached, saying he was not sure
whether there was still a chance.

“We’ll see,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “I hope there is. It’s important to a lot
of people out
there.”

The pledge by career scientists in the federal government came amid
mounting concerns over the role the White House has played in emergency
approvals for coronavirus therapies, including convalescent plasma and
the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which the agency [later
revoked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html).

The specter of political arm-twisting has grown as several drugmakers
entered large late-stage vaccine trials this summer. President Trump
told reporters on Monday that “we’re going to have a vaccine very soon,
maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I’m talking
about.”

That timeline, framed around Election Day, has been [widely
challenged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/science/covid-vaccine-pharma-pledge.html)
by the administration’s top health officials, who have said that a
vaccine approval by early November was improbable.

The statement in USA Today was written in large part because of fears
over political influence on the F.D.A., including from the White House,
according to senior administration officials familiar with the effort.

“We absolutely understand that the F.D.A., like other federal executive
agencies, operates in a political environment,” the regulators wrote.
“That is a reality that we must navigate adeptly while maintaining our
independence to ensure the best possible outcomes for public
health.”

A wide receiver who was cut from the New York Jets on Tuesday has been
charged with fraudulently obtaining a $1.2 million loan from the
Paycheck Protection Program and using the proceeds to buy luxury goods,
prosecutors said on Thursday.

The former player, Joshua J. Bellamy, 31, was charged with wire fraud,
bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud,
[prosecutors
said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nfl-player-charged-role-24-million-covid-relief-fraud-scheme#:~:text=Joshua%20J.%20Bellamy%2C%2031%2C,wire%20fraud%20and%20bank%20fraud.).
He was arrested on Thursday morning and made an initial appearance via
Zoom in federal court in Florida.

Mr. Bellamy, of St. Petersburg, Fla., signed with the Jets in 2019 but
was [sidelined with a shoulder
injury](https://www.newyorkjets.com/news/jets-place-wrs-quincy-enunwa-josh-bellamy-on-reserve-pup)
in March after playing in seven games. He was cut from the team on
Tuesday, according to a Jets spokesman. He had played for the Chicago
Bears from 2014 to 2018.

In [a federal
complaint](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1315621/download),
prosecutors said that Mr. Bellamy had taken part in a scheme with 10
other defendants who collectively filed at least 90 fraudulent loan
applications seeking more than $24 million in coronavirus relief loans.
Many of those loan applications were approved and funded by financial
institutions, paying out at least $17.4 million, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said Mr. Bellamy had obtained a Paycheck Protection Program
loan of $1.25 million for his own company, Drip Entertainment L.L.C.,
which he used to buy more than $104,000 in luxury goods from Dior, Gucci
and other merchants.

Diego Weiner, Mr. Bellamy’s lawyer, said it was “very early in the case,
and Mr. Bellamy is presumed
innocent.”

North Korea has deployed crack troops along its border with a
shoot-to-kill order to prevent smugglers from introducing the
coronavirus into its isolated and malnourished population, the United
States’ top general in South Korea said on Thursday.

North Korea
[insists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html)
that it has not confirmed a single case of Covid-19. But outside experts
are skeptical, citing the country’s decrepit public health capabilities
and the long border it shares with China, where the epidemic first
erupted. More than 90 percent of the North’s external trade normally
goes through its land and sea borders with China.

North Korea shut its borders with China in late January, as fear of the
virus spread. As an added precaution, it has also deployed special
forces troops to create “a buffer zone, one or two kilometers up on the
Chinese border,” said Gen. Robert B. Abrams, commander of the American
military in South Korea.

“They’ve got shoot-to-kill orders in place,” General Abrams said during
an[online conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XkZScCeCWQ) on
Thursday, organized by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies. “This is fundamentally about preventing Covid
from getting into North Korea.”

Given the North’s poor medical systems and its chronically malnourished
population, “a very large outbreak could be devastating,” he said.

As United Nations sanctions have choked North Korea’s economy in recent
years, illegal smuggling across the border with China has increasingly
become a lifeline. But fear of Covid-19 has curbed smuggling as well as
legal trade.

Covid-19 “has[accelerated the effect of
sanctions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/world/asia/north-korea-sanctions-coronavirus.html)
on North Korea,” General Abrams said.

North Korea’s trade with China has plummeted this year, according to
official numbers. To make things worse, the North was hit by three
typhoons in rapid succession that caused extensive damage to homes,
farmland, roads, bridges and mines.

In a series of emergency meetings of the ruling Workers’ Party in recent
weeks, the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un,
has[admitted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/world/asia/north-korea-economy-coronavirus.html)
that his five-year plan to rebuild the economy failed. But he has
ordered the government to undertake recovery efforts [without accepting
outside

and instructed the military to lead the recovery
work.

The federal government next week will halt its policy of screening
international travelers for coronavirus symptoms at 15 designated
airports across the country, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Passengers from regions of the world that were
previously deemed hot spots for the virus will also no longer be
funneled to those airports, beginning Monday.

The C.D.C. said that the federal government would instead commit
resources to a different — and vague — set of procedures, including
“health education” before, during and after flights, “illness
response” at airports, and “potential testing.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

In [a
statement](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/s-0909-covid-19-entry-strategy-air-passengers.html),
the C.D.C. said that the health screenings, which involved temperature
checks and interviews about possible symptoms of the coronavirus, were
no longer a sound way of detecting infections in the “current phase of
the pandemic.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“We now have a better understanding of Covid-19 transmission that
indicates symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because
people with Covid-19 may have no symptoms or fever at the time of
screening, or only mild symptoms,” the agency wrote.

A federal official familiar with the policy change said that another
component of the health screenings at American airports would also be
eliminated: the collection of contact information in case a passenger is
discovered to have been exposed to the virus on a flight. But the
official said that the C.D.C. can still gather passenger information
from airlines to help local health departments with contact tracing
efforts.

Airlines for America, a trade group that represents major airlines, said
on Thursday that it supported the policy change. “We continue to support
spending scarce screening resources where they can best be utilized and,
given the extremely low number of passengers identified by the C.D.C. as
potentially having a health issue, agree that it no longer makes sense
to continue screening at these airports,” said Katherine Estep, a
spokeswoman for the group.

The Department of Homeland Security earlier this year instituted the
policy for travelers who had been in parts of the world ravaged by the
virus, including China and much of Europe, where many of the earliest
outbreaks in the United States were traced back to. The department
required that the passengers be screened at 15 large metropolitan
airports, including Chicago O’Hare, Washington Dulles and Newark Liberty
International.

In the days following the president’s ban on travel from Europe,
employees at 13 designated airports, a number that was later expanded to
15, scrambled to roll out the new health screenings, causing confusion
at airports around the country. Crowds formed as people rushed to get
back into the country from Europe and travelers who could enter the
U.S., including those who showed signs of being physically ill, said
that [the screening
process](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/13/us/politics/coronavirus-travelers-screening.html)
was lax or
nonexistent.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Stanford University doctors and researchers are sounding the alarm about
one of their colleagues, Dr. Scott W. Atlas, a newly influential member
of the White House coronavirus task force.

Dozens of infectious, epidemiological and health policy experts
[published an open
letter](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenttools/read-the-open-letter-from-stanford-doctors-on-scott-atlas/813b50f72b6543b4/full.pdf)
on Wednesday, saying they “have both a moral and an ethical
responsibility to call attention to the falsehoods and
misrepresentations of science recently fostered by” Dr. Atlas.

“Many of his opinions and statements run counter to established science
and, by doing so, undermine public-health authorities and the credible
science that guides effective public health policy,” they wrote.

Dr. Atlas, a radiologist and senior fellow at the university’s
conservative Hoover Institution, has become a proponent of controversial
ideas on how to combat the virus. He has gone against recommendations
put forward by top government doctors and scientists like Anthony S.
Fauci, Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response
coordinator, and Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, promoting
instead ideas embraced by Mr. Trump that have [not been proven
scientifically](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/climate/trump-coronavirus-climate-science.html).

Dr. Atlas has argued that the science supporting mask wearing is
uncertain and that children cannot pass along the virus. He was part of
the decision in early September to modify C.D.C. testing guidelines [to
exclude asymptomatic
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/health/covid-19-testing-cdc.html)
— despite the fact that [research
shows](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission.html)
that people with no symptoms can still carry a high virus load.

He also has supported purposefully creating “herd immunity,” a
questionable strategy that would require mass exposure to the virus.

The letter refutes his assertions point by point.

Encouraging unchecked virus transmission to reach herd immunity would
create “a significant increase in preventable cases, suffering and
deaths, especially among vulnerable populations, such as older
individuals and essential workers,” the faculty members wrote. The
safest path to herd immunity, they said, “is through deployment of
rigorously evaluated, effective vaccines that have been approved by
regulatory agencies.”

Myanmar has locked down half of its largest city, Yangon, and halted
travel between regions in an effort to halt the rapid spread of the
coronavirus.

Myanmar’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has suspended her
election campaign appearances because of the virus, has urged the public
to follow health protocols as the new restrictions go into force.

“You all need to follow the rules and if not, we will take action by
law,” she said Thursday night in a nationally televised address. “The
law is not to punish people. It’s to protect the stability of society.”

Skyrocketing infection rates have worried health officials in Myanmar.
The number of confirmed cases has gone up fivefold in less than three
weeks, reaching 2,265 on Friday morning, according to government
figures. The number of deaths has more than doubled over the past eight
days, to 14.

The chief of Yangon General Hospital, Dr. Maw Maw Oo, said that many
patients who had lost their senses of taste and smell — [both symptoms
of the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html)
— were coming to the hospital. Beds would soon be at capacity, he said,
and health care workers were having to quarantine after exposures.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“If the rate continues to increase like this, I don’t think we will be
able to control it,” he said.

The Yangon lockdown affects about 2.5 million people, who were ordered
not to go to work or school. Airlines suspended all domestic flights
starting Friday.

Myanmar, long ruled by the military and torn by decades of armed
conflict with ethnic groups, remains one of the poorest countries in
Southeast Asia despite its vast wealth in natural resources.

Officials say the country’s beleaguered health care system, with only
16,320 doctors for a population of 54 million people, is poorly prepared
for a major outbreak.

The government ordered a lockdown last month in Rakhine State but the
virus popped up at a karaoke club in Yangon and quickly spread from
there.

Official campaigning for Nov. 8 national elections period began Tuesday,
but Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is seeking re-election to her seat in
Parliament, was forced to suspend her campaign after the virus infected
people on her personal staff and in top government offices.

She and the president, U Win Myint, tested negative this week, but
members of his staff were placed in isolation after some were found to
be infected. Three dozen journalists who report on the government were
also ordered into
isolation.

director, she was beginning her fifth year at Windsor Elementary in
Columbia, S.C., teaching remotely in front of a computer at her home.

Before the end of that first week, Ms. Bannister, 28, had tested
positive. On Monday, a week after the first day of school, she died.

Ms. Bannister had last been at school on Aug. 28 for a teachers’ work

school district said in a statement. Her parents, with whom she lived,
found out they had tested positive on the day that she died, her uncle,
Heyward Bannister said. Her mother is in the hospital.

Bannister said. “She missed that, she missed that.”

Ms. Bannister was just one of a number of educators who died from

Seven months into the pandemic, the virus has been detected in almost

The true death toll may be higher; The Times has found underestimates in
[the official death tallies in the United

The United States has the highest number of cases, followed by India,
which reported more than 95,000 new cases on Thursday, and Brazil. In
deaths, the United States is also first, with Brazil second and India
third.

The pandemic is ebbing in some countries that were hit hard early on,
but the number of new cases is growing faster than ever worldwide, with
more than 200,000 reported each day on average. Cases are worryingly
high in the India, the United States and Israel. In Brazil, cases are
high but appear to be decreasing.

The thousands of asylum seekers crammed into [Europe’s largest refugee
camp](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/02/world/europe/greece-lesbos-moria-refugees.html),
on the Greek island of Lesbos, had for years bridled at their squalid
conditions and the endless delays in resolving their fates. Then came
the coronavirus and strict containment measures, which compounded their
misery.

The combination proved explosive, pushing frustrations over a tipping
point this week, when some camp residents burned down the camp, called
Moria, during a protest over quarantine.

That desperate act has challenged Europe’s leaders once again to come up
with a lasting solution to the migration crisis.

By Thursday afternoon, a third fire in two days had erupted at Moria,
destroying what little was left untouched by [arson attacks earlier in
the
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/world/europe/fire-refugee-camp-lesbos-moria.html)
and stranding nearly 12,000 people in nearby roads and fields.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Almost if not all of the accommodation in and around the site has been
destroyed,” said Theodoros Alexellis, a Lesbos-based official for the
United Nations’ refugee agency.

More than 400 unaccompanied children were transferred off the island.
But no other Moria refugees will be allowed to leave, said Stelios
Petsas, a Greek government spokesman.

“They thought that if they burn Moria they would be able to leave the
island undetected,” Mr. Petsas said. “This is not going to happen.”

He said the whereabouts of most of the 35 Moria residents who tested
positive for the virus were unknown.

Around 1,000 residents will be temporarily housed on a passenger ferry,
and hundreds more will be placed on two naval vessels. It was unclear
where the remaining 10,000 migrants would go.

In other developments around the world:

  - **France**, which is battling a resurgence of the virus, reported a
    daily record for new cases on Thursday. The French Health Ministry
    said there had been 9,843 in the past 24 hours. Hospital admissions
    were also up, with 5,096 patients being treated for the virus, more
    than 600 of them described as having life-threatening infections.

  - **India** on Friday reported a record 96,551 new coronavirus cases,
    pushing the country’s total caseload above 4.5 million, [according
    to a Times
    database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html).
    More than 76,000 deaths have been linked to Covid-19.

  - The U.S. extradition hearing of **Julian Assange**, the embattled
    WikiLeaks founder, which [began in London this
    week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/world/europe/assange-court-extradition-london.html),
    was abruptly halted on Thursday because a member of the prosecution
    team may have been exposed to the coronavirus. The judge decided to
    postpone the hearing until at least Monday, pending the test results
    of the lawyer. Mr. Assange, 49, has been indicted in the United
    States on charges that he conspired with Chelsea Manning, a former
    Army intelligence analyst, to hack into a Pentagon computer network,
    and that he published the secret documents.

  - **Spain’s** return to school has so far been “very positive,” the
    country’s education minister said on Thursday, praising the
    management and staff of schools for their efforts. Isabel Celaá, the
    education minister, told Spanish national television that as of
    Wednesday, there had only been 53 “incidents” related to Covid-19
    across the 28,600 schools that have gradually been reopening. She
    did not provide a specific tally of new cases among children. She
    also welcomed the fact that only “a minority” of parents had so far
    decided not to send back their children.

  - The Chinese city of **Wuhan**, where the coronavirus was first
    detected, is resuming international flights. The first is a Sept. 16
    T’way Airlines flight between Wuhan and Seoul, the South Korean
    capital, China’s state-run media reported on Thursday. Several
    carriers are applying for permission to restart direct flights
    between Wuhan and other major cities in the region, according to a
    report in People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese
    Communist Party.

## Americans worry that political pressure by Trump will lead the F.D.A. to rush to approve a vaccine.

A clear majority of American adults are worried that political pressure
from the Trump administration will lead the Food and Drug Administration
to rush to approve a coronavirus vaccine without making sure it is safe
and effective, and nearly half hold at least one serious misconception
about coronavirus prevention and treatment, according to [a new
poll](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2020/)
released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The poll, which tracks public attitudes about a range of issues, found
that Americans are feeling more optimistic. More than six months into
the pandemic, 38 percent now say “the worst is yet to come,” down nearly
half from 74 percent in early April. And another 38 percent say “the
worst is behind us,” up from 13 percent in April.

The poll, a nationally representative random sample of 1,199 adults, was
conducted between Aug. 28 and Sept. 3, and had a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points. It found that 62 percent of adults are
worried about political pressure on the F.D.A. to approve a vaccine,
with Democrats being far more worried than Republicans.

At the same time, Americans hold misconceptions about prevention and
treatment of Covid-19. One in five believe wearing a face mask is
harmful to your health, and one in four say hydroxychloroquine — an
anti-malaria drug touted by Mr. Trump — is an effective treatment for
coronavirus infection, despite clear evidence to the contrary and the
F.D.A.’s [decision to revoke an emergency waiver for use of the
medicine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html).

At the same time, trust in some official sources of information on the
coronavirus is declining. About two in three adults — 68 percent — now
say they have at least a fair amount of trust in Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,
the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, down from 78 percent in April. An equal 68 percent say they
now have trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, down
16 percentage points from April.

In other U.S. news:

  - **The Justice Department** said that between May and September, its
    criminal division had charged 57 people with attempting to steal
    [more than $175 million in funding from the Paycheck Protection
    Program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/politics/ppp-fraud-coronavirus.html),
    a federal small business relief initiative.

  - More than four months after Americans began emerging from lockdown
    across most states, the job market remains treacherous, according to
    new data from the Labor Department. More than **[857,000 workers
    filed new
    claims](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/business/economy/unemployment-claims.html?searchResultPosition=1)**
    for state unemployment insurance last week, before seasonal
    adjustments, a slight increase from the previous week. Although the
    unemployment rate [has fallen to 8.4
    percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/business/economy/jobs-report.html),
    the level of layoffs reflects the challenges for many workers in the
    fitful
recovery.

## N.Y.C. public transit riders can be fined $50 for not wearing a face covering.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

New York City’s public transit riders will soon face $50 fines for not
wearing a face covering, officials announced on Thursday.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The rule will go into effect on Monday and will be enforced by the New
York Police Department and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
police force, both of which patrol [the sprawling
system](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/nyregion/nyc-subway-bus-service-cuts.html).
The transportation authority runs the subway, buses and two commuter
rails.

“This is really a last resort for people who refuse to wear a mask when
offered,” said Sarah Feinberg, interim president of New York City
Transit, which runs the subway and buses. “We believe this will get us
closer to the goal of 100-percent mask compliance.”

In April, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo mandated that people wear face coverings
when they ride public transportation — or risk being ejected. Since
then, the transit agency has rolled out digital posters and P.S.A.
announcements reminding straphangers of the mandate. And millions of
free masks have been handed out to riders.

Observational studies conducted by the transit agency have found that 90
percent of riders wear masks, though 15 percent of those riders are not
wearing them properly.

Transit officials hope the new fines will encourage New Yorkers [wary of
riding public
transportation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/10/nyregion/nyc-subway-coronavirus.html)
to return to the system. Ridership on the subway is still just 25
percent of pre-pandemic levels.

“If they’re not wearing a mask, we will enforce the mask-wearing rule,”
Mr. Cuomo, who controls the M.T.A., said Thursday. “We have to be able
to say that to give riders comfort to re-engage the system.”

Since the peak out of the outbreak in New York City, residents who break
social distancing rules could be issued fines up to $1,000. Businesses
that allow patrons to violate state social distancing and face covering
guidelines can also face
fines.

Before classes began in August at the University of Alabama, the
administration issued a set of rules for the coming semester, mandating
physical distancing and mask wearing in most places and prohibiting
large gatherings and off-campus parties. It warned that violators would
face sanctions, including the possibility of a one-year suspension.

Several weeks and more than [2,000 positive virus
tests](https://uasystem.edu/covid-19-dashboard/) later, the penalties
have kicked in.

According to a university spokeswoman, the university has issued 639
individual student sanctions as of Sept. 8. Thirty-three students have
effectively been suspended from campus, Deidre Stalnaker wrote in an
email message, “while their conduct cases proceed through due process.”

Three student organizations, she said, have received “Covid-related
sanctions,” and one organization is pending suspension.

College campuses across the country have had to invent on the fly a
whole new enforcement regime for the coming semester, [trying, and often

tuition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/05/world/coronavirus-covid.html).

The University of Alabama spokeswoman did not identify what types of
violations had led to the sanctions.

In late August, the university announced a moratorium on in-person
student events outside classrooms. Common areas in dorms and fraternity
and sorority houses have been closed, and visitors prohibited.
