# Travis Scott Meets McDonald’s (It’s Lit\!)

</div>

A partnership between the rapper and the fast-food chain is a melding of
the merchandising minds.

During my childhood years, my family’s kitchen cabinets used to be lousy
with the sorts of commemorative glassware you’d get at Burger King or
McDonald’s — a Luke Skywalker here, a Snoopy there. These were part of
huge global marketing pushes for creative projects being milked for
every last ounce of intellectual property, but also savvy positioning by
the restaurants. Fast-food companies have long attempted to stave off
disposability by piggybacking on broader cultural moments, hoping to
extend their reach beyond the comestible into the permanently tangible.

In 2020, a fast-food chain looking for equivalent big-tent cultural
relevance has few more compelling places to turn than hip-hop, the
cultural arena with the most natural and ambitious gift for
merchandising. And in hip-hop, there are fewer more ambitious personal
branders than Travis Scott, who has his own festival, several Nike
collaborations, a cereal, a Hot Wheels and much more [to his
name](https://www.complex.com/style/travis-scott-brand-collaboration-timeline).

That said, the collaboration between McDonald’s and Scott, which began
this week and includes a range of merchandise and a limited-edition
[meal](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/travis-scott-meal.html),
initially seems preposterous — what does McDonald’s know about the right
singing-to-rapping ratio? What does Scott know about the right
salt-to-fry ratio?

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Juggernauts gonna juggernaut, though. And each gets something from the
other. For Scott, it’s the scale of the flex — a partnership with a
brand the magnitude of McDonald’s is essentially unheard-of. (What’s
next: Walmart? Berkshire Hathaway?) It’s a way to slip his aesthetics
into the global mainstream through ads and products, and also something
that doesn’t exist in music anymore: physical distribution locations.
(There are over 13,000 McDonald’s restaurants in the United States.)

<div class="css-53u6y8">

In exchange, McDonald’s gets some refracted cool and the satisfaction of
knowing that thousands of young people might find their way — through
the co-branded merchandise — into becoming walking billboards,
especially crucial given that while McDonald’s remains among the most
valuable fast-food restaurant brands on the planet, with total global
revenue of around $21 billion each of the last two years, it’s still a
business in [overall
decline](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCD/mcdonalds/revenue),
from a high of $28 billion in 2013. Partnering with Scott is a way to
advertise to young people without all the burdens and potential misfires
of actually advertising to young people.

It would all be so sinister, so savagely instrumental, if it weren’t so
effective. The range of products in the [merchandise
drop](https://shop.travisscott.com/) is frankly staggering. There are
umpteen T-shirts — some insert Scott’s imprint name, Cactus Jack, into
the Golden Arches; some are inspired by early 1990s sports aesthetics.
There are rugs, a lunchbox, socks, a tie, a $90 McNugget body pillow. As
with most of Scott’s merch, it’s well-designed, colorful, playful. The
brown work jacket with “Billions and Billions Served” embroidered on the
back ($128) could have been right out of a dawn-of-the-’90s Beastie Boys
video.

These garments are likely to look better in the rearview a couple of
decades from now. Though they’re well-designed, wearing clothing
advertising the leading fast-food brand is, in a Sweetgreen era, an
unprogressive choice — nostalgia tends to soften capitalist excesses,
though.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

There’s a television commercial, too, in which an action figure version
of Scott — speaking in his real(?) voice — showcases his meal: “same
order since back in Houston.” Here, too, a mutual compromise:
McDonald’s, potentially still skittish about aligning with a rapper,
swaps in an animated version in the ad. (Some franchisees apparently
[opposed](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/marketing/mcdonalds-reveals-its-multi-level-deal-travis-scott#)
the partnership, citing Scott’s risqué lyrics.)

And Scott retains a bit of personal mystery. From this action figure
commercial to his recent [concert on the video game
Fortnite](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report),
he has been moving toward full time avatar territory. He is already
among the most reluctant of hip-hop stars, almost never photographed
with his eyes engaging the camera. And his voice is generally digitally
processed practically beyond recognition, merely shrugging off the
texture of reality. He is becoming an A.I. musician long before the
algorithms take over.

His aesthetics, though, he’s willing to share. A collaboration at this
scale is maybe a final stop before a full-fledged brand of one’s own — a
Yeezy or a Fenty. Despite hip-hop’s complete dominance of pop culture,
there is still a bit of a lag when it comes to the willingness of large
mainstream brands to work with hip-hop stars. It’s still a light shock
to see DJ Khaled hawking for Geico, or Snoop Dogg for Corona (or Dunkin’
or the General or Tostitos).

McDonald’s partnership with Scott may well be the savviest music/food
pairing since the Starbucks music program, which [placed CDs from its
Hear Records
label](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2004/11/03/arts/music/would-you-like-an-extra-shot-of-music-with-that-macchiato.html)
next to its registers. Which brings us back to food. There is of course
also a Travis Scott Meal, which costs $6 — a specialty burger something
like an amped-up Quarter Pounder With Cheese, fries with barbecue sauce
and a Sprite — that sadly does not come with a toy. Part of why the
Scott/McDonald’s alliance feels different is because of the intimacy of
food — it’s one thing to attach a celebrity to a luxury item, but to
attach one to a commodity product is a far bolder statement.

A couple of days ago, Scott had a not very socially distanced [launch
event at a
McDonald’s](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/09/08/rapper-travis-scott-mobbed-by-fans-at-downey-mcdonalds/)
in Downey, Calif. Scott’s buddies wore special shirts made for employees
and cheesed for pictures [over the
griddle](https://www.instagram.com/p/CE5af3pJCR3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

At the McDonald’s closest to my house on Wednesday, though, there was
little hubbub — just another day in the fry-guy trenches. A sign in the
outer window featured a glam shot of the meal and referred to it as a
“limited time collab.” On the video menu screen inside, a picture of
the sandwich appeared next to a scrawled Travis Scott catchphrase: “It’s
Lit\!” I bought one and can confirm the sandwich tasted … exactly like
McDonald’s. I lasted one bite — the Sprite was a deeply necessary palate
cleanse.

As merch goes, the Travis Scott Meal is imperfect in that it disappears
— you’ve got nothing to show for it apart from oily skin and a mild
gastric hangover. As a collector, I was much more interested in the
grill slip, the small, grease-mottled piece of paper stuck to the top of
the box that indicates a special order, and which was marked “The Travis
Scott.” It is peak ephemera, utilitarian debris of a peculiar cultural
moment. I threw out the sandwich, and pocketed the slip.
