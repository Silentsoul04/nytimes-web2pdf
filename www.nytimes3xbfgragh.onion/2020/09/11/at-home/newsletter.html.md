<div class="css-53u6y8">

Welcome. I like to get up while it’s dark, before anyone else has begun
to stir, walking through the apartment on tiptoe with the world on mute.
I fix my coffee in the dark and wake up slowly. There are fewer
variables, minimal stimuli. At 5 a.m., New York’s famed sleeplessness is
repudiated.

This morning, I used the time to sit and think. I tried to remember the
early morning on this date 19 years ago, but found many details were
lost. That day, in my memory, begins at 8:50 a.m., when I left the house
for work. My recollection is limited to the broad strokes of the
narrative I’ve retold over the years: I went here, I saw this, I felt
this. I know I bought dried figs on the walk home, but only because I’ve
recounted that one detail so many times.

**If only I’d kept a log book then.** I learned about the log book from
[the artist Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/2010/01/31/logbook/),
who recommends keeping “a calendar of past events,” a notebook where you
record the ordinary facts of the day. It’s a very simple form of
[commonplacing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Commonplace_book), of
setting aside information for your future self. I love the simplicity of
this practice, how it’s distinct from [a
diary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/smarter-living/why-you-should-start-a-coronavirus-diary.html),
which to me implies commitment and complete sentences. As Mr. Kleon
writes:

> Keeping a simple list of who/what/where means I write down events that
> seem mundane at the time, but later on help paint a better portrait of
> the day, or even become more significant over time. By “sticking to
> the facts” I don’t prejudge what was important or what wasn’t, I just
> write it down.

The log book excites me because its simple lists of small details might,
when I reread them someday, **unlock troves of memory**. If I jot down
that on Sept. 11, 2020 I bought oat milk from the deli on the corner,
then perhaps, decades from now, that shorthand will remind me of the $5
bunches of hyacinths I bought every spring at that deli, how I once saw
a handwritten sign taped to the shelf there that said **“PLEASE STOP
BITING THE BREAD,”** that I used to go there late at night and chat with
the owner through masks, that I once saw a famous musician there in his
pajamas and slippers. I’ll be able to **access the particulars of this
period** and not just the synopsis of a year in quarantine.

### <span>Tell us.</span>

**What would you write in your log book today?** What bit of info will
you jot down that you would otherwise forget? **Write to us:**
<athome@NYTimes.com>. Include your first and last name, age and city.
We’re [At Home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/spotlight/at-home).
We’ll read every letter sent. And thank you for sending your favorite
cover songs; I’m listening to and loving so many of them and will share
them next week. As always, more ideas for living an agreeable life at
home and near it this weekend appear
below.

    Song,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/arts/music/sam-hunt-hard-to-forget.html)
    the host Joe Coscarelli goes deep on Sam Hunt’s country radio No. 1,
    “Hard to Forget.” The song samples Webb Pierce’s “There Stands the
    Glass,” a fixture of the Grand Ole Opry from 1953, as well as 808
    drums borrowed from rap.

  - New York Fashion Week this year will consist of “digital
    activations,” which, in most cases, means live shows will be
    replaced by videos, online lookbooks or a combination of the two. In
    Europe, some cities are still committed to holding in-person shows,
    despite travel advisories. We break it all down for you in [our
    opinionated guide to Fashion
    Month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/style/fashion-month-schedule.html).

    Stories,” is due out today. Have a look at her 10 [cultural
    must-haves](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/arts/music/suzanne-vega-favorites.html),

  - “I think that being a provocateur, in the good sense, means to
    challenge the status quo,” says the “Call Me by Your Name” director
    [Luca
    Guadagnino](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/arts/television/luca-guadagnino.html),
    who has a new series coming to HBO next week. The show, “We Are Who
    We Are,” follows a group of teens who are exploring their gender and
    sexual identity. Guadagnino was inspired by the teenagers whom he
    worked with, relying on them as creative forces.

  - If you’re in the mood for a political documentary this weekend,
    consider [“Jimmy Carter Rock & Roll
    President,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/movies/jimmy-carter-rock-roll-president-review.html)
    a musical chronicle of Carter’s campaign, presidency and beyond. And
    Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic candidate for governor of
    Georgia, was a producer on [“All In: The Fight for
    Democracy,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/movies/all-in-the-fight-for-democracy-review.html)
    which interweaves the history of disenfranchisement in the United
    States with her own story.

  - And if you’re in the mood to stream something but you can’t decide
    what to watch, check out our selections for the [best movies on
    Amazon Prime

  - Now that many people are at home for much of the week, the concept
    of [“time off” has lost some of its
    meaning](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/style/what-should-i-do-this-weekend.html).
    For some, every day looks like a weekday, replete with chores and
    looking after children. For others, it’s an endless weekend, free of
    Sunday scaries and early-morning commutes.

  - People who have acquired dogs during the pandemic are taking their
    new pooches with them when they travel. [“Corona puppies” are
    joining their owners on road
    trips](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/travel/virus-dogs-vacation.html),
    staying with them in Airbnbs and snuggling into sleeping bags with
    them at campsites around the country.

  - And we visited stores around the country and spoke with the [people
    waiting in long
    lines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/style/line-waiting-pandemic-shopping.html)
