They'll unlock a cascade of memory in the future.

Welcome. I like to get up while it's dark, before anyone else has begun
to stir, walking through the apartment on tiptoe with the world on mute.
I fix my coffee in the dark and wake up slowly. There are fewer
variables, minimal stimuli. At 5 a.m., New York's famed sleeplessness is
repudiated.

This morning, I used the time to sit and think. I tried to remember the
early morning on this date 19 years ago, but found many details were
lost. That day, in my memory, begins at 8:50 a.m., when I left the house
for work. My recollection is limited to the broad strokes of the
narrative I've retold over the years: I went here, I saw this, I felt
this. I know I bought dried figs on the walk home, but only because I've
recounted that one detail so many times.

\textbf{If only I'd kept a log book then.} I learned about the log book
from \href{https://austinkleon.com/2010/01/31/logbook/}{the artist
Austin Kleon}, who recommends keeping ``a calendar of past events,'' a
notebook where you record the ordinary facts of the day. It's a very
simple form of
\href{https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Commonplace_book}{commonplacing}, of
setting aside information for your future self. I love the simplicity of
this practice, how it's distinct from
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/smarter-living/why-you-should-start-a-coronavirus-diary.html}{a
diary}, which to me implies commitment and complete sentences. As Mr.
Kleon writes:

\begin{quote}
Keeping a simple list of who/what/where means I write down events that
seem mundane at the time, but later on help paint a better portrait of
the day, or even become more significant over time. By ``sticking to the
facts'' I don't prejudge what was important or what wasn't, I just write
it down.
\end{quote}

The log book excites me because its simple lists of small details might,
when I reread them someday, \textbf{unlock troves of memory}. If I jot
down that on Sept. 11, 2020 I bought oat milk from the deli on the
corner, then perhaps, decades from now, that shorthand will remind me of
the \$5 bunches of hyacinths I bought every spring at that deli, how I
once saw a handwritten sign taped to the shelf there that said
\textbf{``PLEASE STOP BITING THE BREAD,''} that I used to go there late
at night and chat with the owner through masks, that I once saw a famous
musician there in his pajamas and slippers. I'll be able to
\textbf{access the particulars of this period} and not just the synopsis
of a year in quarantine.

  In the latest installment of
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/arts/music/sam-hunt-hard-to-forget.html}{``Diary
  of a Song,''} the host Joe Coscarelli goes deep on Sam Hunt's country
  radio No. 1, ``Hard to Forget.'' The song samples Webb Pierce's
  ``There Stands the Glass,'' a fixture of the Grand Ole Opry from 1953,
  as well as 808 drums borrowed from rap.
\item
  New York Fashion Week this year will consist of ``digital
  activations,'' which, in most cases, means live shows will be replaced
  by videos, online lookbooks or a combination of the two. In Europe,
  some cities are still committed to holding in-person shows, despite
  travel advisories. We break it all down for you in
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/style/fashion-month-schedule.html}{our
  opinionated guide to Fashion Month}.
\item
  Suzanne Vega's new live album, ``An Evening of New York Songs and
  Stories,'' is due out today. Have a look at her 10
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/arts/music/suzanne-vega-favorites.html}{cultural
  must-haves}, which include William James's ``The Varieties of
  Religious Experience'' and Revlon ``Cherries in the Snow'' lipstick.

  ``I think that being a provocateur, in the good sense, means to
  challenge the status quo,'' says the ``Call Me by Your Name'' director
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/arts/television/luca-guadagnino.html}{Luca
  Guadagnino}, who has a new series coming to HBO next week. The show,
  ``We Are Who We Are,'' follows a group of teens who are exploring
  their gender and sexual identity. Guadagnino was inspired by the
  teenagers whom he worked with, relying on them as creative forces.
\item
  If you're in the mood for a political documentary this weekend,
  consider
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/movies/jimmy-carter-rock-roll-president-review.html}{``Jimmy
  Carter Rock \& Roll President,''} a musical chronicle of Carter's
  campaign, presidency and beyond. And Stacey Abrams, the former
  Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia, was a producer on
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/movies/all-in-the-fight-for-democracy-review.html}{``All
  In: The Fight for Democracy,''} which interweaves the history of
  disenfranchisement in the United States with her own story.
\item
  And if you're in the mood to stream something but you can't decide
  what to watch, check out our selections for the

  Now that many people are at home for much of the week, the concept of
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/style/what-should-i-do-this-weekend.html}{``time
  off'' has lost some of its meaning}. For some, every day looks like a
  weekday, replete with chores and looking after children. For others,
  it's an endless weekend, free of Sunday scaries and early-morning
  commutes.
\item
  People who have acquired dogs during the pandemic are taking their new
  pooches with them when they travel.
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/travel/virus-dogs-vacation.html}{``Corona
  puppies'' are joining their owners on road trips}, staying with them
  in Airbnbs and snuggling into sleeping bags with them at campsites
  around the country.
\item
  And we visited stores around the country and spoke with the
  \href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/style/line-waiting-pandemic-shopping.html}{people
  waiting in long lines} to enter them. Have a look.
