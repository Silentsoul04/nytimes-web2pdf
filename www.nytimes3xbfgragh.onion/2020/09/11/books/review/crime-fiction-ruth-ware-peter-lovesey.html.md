What’s a wobble? you ask. In Victorian England, it was a grueling,
six-day speedwalking race, a fad that also became popular in America.
This eccentric sport inspired Peter Lovesey’s first murder mystery,
“[Wobble to
Death](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/jun/19/sports-doping-victorian-style),”
originally published in 1970.

To mark the 50th anniversary of the novel, Lovesey has written a
companion piece, **THE FINISHER (Soho Crime, 353 pp., $27.95),** about
another footrace and another murder that becomes a baffling case for his
enduring series detective, Peter Diamond of the Bath police. That
classically designed English city might not seem like the ideal setting
for a marathon. But Lovesey knows his city intimately, and once the
5,000 or so entrants are off and running — along with “the pirates,
pantomime horses, fairies, carrots, bananas, spacemen, dinosaurs” and
other costumed entrants running for the fun of it — he treats us to
lovingly detailed descriptions of the civic highlights. The runners he
follows are an interesting cross section of the citizenry, from Maeve
Kelly, a primary schoolteacher whose drab life gets its sparkle after
she takes up running, to an illegal immigrant named Spiro, who escapes
virtual slavery in his native Albania only to find himself running for
his life in Bath.

Lovesey is careful to remind us that Bath holds hidden secrets behind
its gracious Georgian architecture. “It offers unrivaled facilities for
getting rid of unwanted corpses,” he says. “Beneath the creamy,
sun-kissed squares, crescents and terraces is a rat-infested underworld
undreamed of by most visitors.” This is the secret world traveled by
“the Finisher,” a murderer who leaves no traces because of his
intimate knowledge of the city’s “dark, dank warren of cellars, vaults,
culverts, sewers and drains.” The light and dark imagery is a fixture of
Lovesey’s Bath novels, in which life is lived on many levels, some in
full sunshine and others buried in shadow.

It’s the middle of winter in Matt Goldman’s **DEAD WEST (Forge, 320 pp.,
$26.99),** and Minnesota temperatures are below zero. That’s reason
enough for Goldman’s engaging private eye, Nils Shapiro, to jump on an
assignment that will take him to warm and sunny Los Angeles. The job
seems like a no-brainer; all he has to do is reassure his client that
her grandson, Ebben Mayer, hasn’t blown his $50 million inheritance on
something stupid, like the movie business. But when he gets to
California, Shapiro finds Ebben mourning the suspicious death of his
fiancée and deeply invested in a film.

Always a clever writer, Goldman is flat-out hilarious when he’s
satirizing Hollywood hustlers and their outlandish projects. In this
town, he notes, even a Russian gangster has a screenplay in his trunk.
(“Russian tragedy. Will make you cry.”) Individually, these agents,
managers, writers, producers, et al. are endearingly awful; but
observing them in groups — pitching ideas, taking meetings and poisoning
their best friends — is too funny for words.

Let’s say you want to isolate a group of people from the outside world.
Where would you put them? A ship at sea would work. [So would a mansion
in the Scottish
Highlands](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/17/books/review/the-whisper-man-alex-north-turn-of-the-key-ruth-ware-adrian-mckinty-chain.html).[Ruth
Ware](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/07/books/review/inside-the-list.html)
has already used those settings, so she sets the bar higher in **ONE BY
ONE (Scout Press, 372 pp., $27.99)** by burying her principal players in
an Alpine chalet beneath an avalanche.

“There is a definite gilded quality to this group,” Ware writes. They’re
an insufferable lot for the most part, especially when they’re fighting
over stock shares, so that lovely avalanche can’t arrive soon enough.
One awed observer sees “what looks like a wall of snow coming down. But
not a wall — that implies something solid. This is something else. A
boiling mass that is air and ice and earth all rolled together.”

Happily, most of these twits know how to ski, so there are stunning
scenes on the mountain as, one by one, they fall off cliffs, plunge into
ravines and tumble into snowbanks. Readers will recognize the obvious
homage to Agatha Christie’s “And Then There Were None,” but with enough
ingenious twists to make this whodunit another triumph for Ware.

My idea of a good psychological suspense story is one that messes with
your head. No cheap thrills, just lots of disorienting plot twists that
have you doubting your own mental faculties. **AN INCONVENIENT WOMAN
(Scarlet, 312 pp., $25.95),** a remarkably polished first mystery by
Stéphanie Buelens, succeeds at these mind games with a taut plot about
Claire Fontaine, a woman who can’t convince anyone that her ex-husband,
Simon, had abused her daughter and caused her death. But in her
determination to keep him from doing the same thing to another woman’s
daughter, Claire devotes herself to stalking him. Another strong woman
enters the story when Simon hires Sloan Wilson, a “sin eater” who makes
her clients’ problems go away.

So, what’s the story here? Is Simon a monster? Is Claire delusional,
“the madwoman in the attic”? And will the marvelous Sloan Wilson come
back to fix more broken souls? One hopes.
