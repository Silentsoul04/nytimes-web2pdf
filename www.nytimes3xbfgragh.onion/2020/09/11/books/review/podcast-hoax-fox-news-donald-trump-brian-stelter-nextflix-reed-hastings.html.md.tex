In his new book,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/books/review/brian-stelter-hoax.html}{``Hoax:
Donald Trump, Fox News and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth,''} the CNN
journalist Brian Stelter provides what our reviewer David Enrich called
``a thorough and damning exploration of the incestuous relationship
between Trump and his favorite channel.'' Stelter talks about ``Hoax''
on this week's podcast.

``Fox's influence is constant,'' he says. ``When Trump threatened North
Korea and said he had a bigger button than Kim Jong-un, it was because
of a Fox segment. When he grants pardons, it's because of Fox. When he
attacks big technology companies, it's because of Fox. When he raged
about migrant caravans, it was because of Fox.'' Stelter contrasts this
with previous presidents, who may have taken cues from the media but not
in such an overwhelming way. ``Barack Obama watched ESPN in the evening
rather than MSNBC. George W. Bush might have watched some Fox, but he
wasn't \emph{consumed} by it the way that this president is. So it's an
unprecedented relationship, it really is.''

Reed Hastings, the co-chief executive of Netflix, visits the podcast to
talk about his new book, written with Erin Meyer,
\href{https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/606529/no-rules-rules-by-reed-hastings-and-erin-meyer/}{``No
Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention.''} ``I think all
forms of entertainment, including video games and YouTube and books and
television, compete for people's attentions,'' Hastings says. ``But any
one form is not going to achieve success by imitating another. So we
don't sit around and say, `Let's make our movies to be more like
Fortnite, the video game.'''

Also on this week's episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the
publishing world; and MJ Franklin and John Williams talk about what
people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
