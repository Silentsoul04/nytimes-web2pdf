China is still most likely months away from mass producing a vaccine
that is safe for public use. But the country is using the prospect of
the drug's discovery in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/business/china-vaccine-diplomacy.html}{a
charm offensive aimed at repairing damaged ties} and bringing friends
closer in regions China deems vital to its interests.

Latin American and Caribbean nations will receive loans to buy the
medicine, and Bangladesh will get over 100,000 free doses from a Chinese
company.

In the Philippines, where China is competing with the United States for
influence, President Rodrigo Duterte
\href{https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3094918/duterte-seeks-chinese-coronavirus-vaccine-rules-out-us-bases}{told
lawmakers} in July that he had ``made a plea'' to China's leader, Xi
Jinping for help with vaccines. He also said he would not confront China
over its claims to the South China Sea.

A day later, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said
China was willing to give the Philippines priority access to a vaccine.

China's vaccine pledges, on top of earlier shipments of masks and
ventilators around the world, help it project itself as a responsible
player as the United States retreats from global leadership. Beijing's
moves could also help it push back against accusations that the ruling
Communist Party should be held responsible for its
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/world/asia/china-coronavirus-beijing-trump.html}{initial
missteps} when the coronavirus first emerged in China in December.

The ability to develop and deliver vaccines to poorer countries would
also be a powerful signal of China's rise as a scientific leader in a
new post-pandemic global order.

``People are very willing to take a Chinese vaccine,'' said Ghazala
Parveen, a senior official at the National Institute of Health in
Pakistan, where two Chinese vaccine makers are conducting trials. ``In
fact, we are being asked by people to have the vaccine ready as soon as
possible.''
