As the global economy absorbs the most punishing reversal of fortunes
since the Great Depression,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/business/covid-hunger-food-insecurity.html}{hunger
is on the rise}.

Those confronting potentially life-threatening levels of so-called food
insecurity in the developing world are expected to nearly double this
year to 265 million, according to the
\href{https://www.wfp.org/news/covid-19-will-double-number-people-facing-food-crises-unless-swift-action-taken}{United
Nations World Food Program}.

Worldwide, the number of children younger than 5 caught in a state of
so-called wasting --- their weight so far below normal that they face an
elevated risk of death, along with long-term health and developmental
problems --- is likely to grow by nearly seven million this year, or 14
percent, according to a recent paper published in
\href{https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31647-0/fulltext}{The
Lancet}, a medical journal.

The largest numbers of vulnerable communities are concentrated in South
Asia and Africa, especially in countries that are already confronting
trouble, from military conflict and extreme poverty to climate-related
afflictions like drought, flooding and soil erosion.

The unfolding tragedy falls short of a famine, which is typically set
off by a combination of war and environmental disaster. Food remains
widely available in most of the world, though prices have climbed in
many countries.

Rather, with the
\href{https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/06/24/WEOUpdateJune2020}{world
economy expected to contract} nearly 5 percent this year, households are
cutting back sharply on spending. Among those who went into the pandemic
in extreme poverty, hundreds of millions of people are suffering an
intensifying crisis over how to secure their basic dietary needs.

The pandemic has reinforced basic economic inequalities, none more
defining than access to food.

``I'm increasingly concerned about the socioeconomic impacts of the
pandemic on the nutrition situation of children,'' said Victor Aguayo,
chief of nutrition programs at UNICEF in New York. ``It's a perfect
storm to see an increase in malnutrition rates if appropriate measures
and programs are not put in place.''
