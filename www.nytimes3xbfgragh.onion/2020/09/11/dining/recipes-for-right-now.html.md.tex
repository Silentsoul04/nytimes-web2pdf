Hello and welcome to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/column/five-weeknight-dishes}{Five
Weeknight Dishes}. Celestially speaking, we are still in summer, but as
soon as we pass Labor Day, I start thinking of roast chicken, squash and
apple cakes. (This may have something to do with the fact that your
hard-working NYT Cooking staff is currently preparing for Thanksgiving.)

But I'm not yet ready to part with peaches, or plums, or berries,
tomatoes and corn. So here are recipes that merge summer produce and
fall cravings, or that would just be really delicious right now. Tell me
whether I hit the mark at
\href{mailto:dearemily@NYTimes.com}{\nolinkurl{dearemily@NYTimes.com}}.

Here are five dishes for the week:

Chicken With Roasted Plums and Onions}}

Golden chicken! Juicy plums! I will be making this Melissa Clark recipe
for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which begins on Friday, Sept. 18.
The meal traditionally calls for some sweetness, which those plums
provide. You can make this with bone-in thighs, rather than a cut-up
whole chicken, if that simplifies cooking or shopping.

Mei Faan (Cantonese Creamed Corn With Tofu and Rice)}}

This is one of the best recipes I've cooked in a long time. Hetty
McKinnon uses fresh corn in place of the canned creamed corn you'd
typically find in this Cantonese dish, and she swaps in silken tofu for
the meat or fish. The simple flavors here are delectable together,
especially with chile oil, but the way the textures mingle makes the
dish.

Meatballs With Peaches, Basil and Lime}}

Here's another recipe from Melissa Clark that combines meat with stone
fruit --- a time-tested and superb combination --- and I like that she
finishes the dish with a long squeeze of lime. The gingery meatballs can
be made with any ground meat, including chicken and turkey, but pork is
best.

Cucumbers With Yogurt, Lemon and Herbs}}

A salad this special can anchor a meal. Don't wait too long to make this
spicy, herby recipe by Yewande Komolafe --- it will taste best at the
end of a hot day, with something utterly simple on the side. (I'd grill
or pan-fry fish.)

With Chickpeas and a Negroni}}

I could use a negroni right now. I appreciate Sam Sifton for writing it
directly into this simple pasta recipe --- which, to be technical, is
one of his no-recipe recipes, meaning that the instructions are written
out in the text of the headnote beside the photo.
