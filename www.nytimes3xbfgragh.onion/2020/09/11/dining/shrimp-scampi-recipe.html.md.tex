Shrimp}\label{this-is-the-path-to-perfect-weeknight-shrimp}}

This twist on a buttery, garlicky scampi gets a sweet-tart lift from
burst Sungold tomatoes and tangy fresh lime.

For the occasional shrimp eater, it can be hard to get past the scampi
trap.

After all, if you're not cooking shrimp very often, why stray from it?
With its buttery, garlicky, wine-kissed sauce,
\href{https://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/9101-classic-shrimp-scampi}{shrimp
scampi} is arguably the most perfect way to savor the crustaceans.

But, as excellent as the combination of shrimp, butter and garlic may
be, it does lack one quintessentially shrimp-friendly ingredient: juicy
ripe tomatoes. And adding a handful of small Sungolds (or other cherry
tomatoes) to your skillet --- along with plenty of that garlic and
butter --- makes for a bright, full-flavored meal that's speedy and
complex.

Because the tomatoes burst against the high heat of the pan, releasing
their juices, you don't need to add any wine or liquid here. Some grated
fresh ginger, along with a little lime squeezed on top at the end, give
the dish enough sharpness to balance the sweetness of tomatoes and
shrimp.

The lime is especially important if you do use the Sungolds, though.
This low-acid, orange-hued variety can have a concentrated, sugary
character, especially when very ripe. Gradually squeeze in the lime,
tasting as you go, and don't stop until the flavors shimmer on your
tongue, darting between bracing and bold, mellow and buttery.

Then there are the spices, which add an aromatic dimension to the mix.
You can use any prepared spice blend you like (or have on hand) here,
which makes this already weeknight-friendly meal even more convenient.
Garam masala, curry powder, Baharat, five-spice powder or a mild chili
powder blend will all round out the dish, adding their distinct, deep
and earthy notes. Just keep in mind that if you're using a spice mix
that's on the fiery side, you might want to cut the amount by ¼ to ½
teaspoon at the beginning of the recipe. Then add more to taste just
before serving to give you more control over the heat level.

Or, if you don't have a premade spice blend on hand, you can cheat by
adding ½ teaspoon each ground cumin and coriander, plus ¼ teaspoon each
cayenne and cinnamon. Although it won't have quite the nuanced character
of a more deliberate blend, it will help you get a tasty and colorful
shrimp dinner on the table quickly and easily. And for this delightful
one-pan dinner, that's exactly the point.
