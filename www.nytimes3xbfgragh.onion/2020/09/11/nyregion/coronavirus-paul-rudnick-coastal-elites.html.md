# How Paul Rudnick, Humorist, Spends His Sundays

</div>

In his new socially distanced HBO satire, “Coastal Elites,” five New
Yorkers and Angelenos handle the curveballs of 2020.

In 1993, Paul Rudnick made his mark as a comedic writer who took on
serious issues with
“[Jeffrey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1993/01/21/theater/review-theater-laughs-that-mask-the-fears-of-gay-manhattan.html?searchResultPosition=7),”
a play that captured the strained social tenor of AIDS-ravaged
Manhattan. At first, producers refused to stage the production, but it
eventually became an award-winning Off Broadway hit, followed by a movie
version, starring Patrick Stewart.

Mr. Rudnick’s newest project, “[Coastal
Elites](https://www.hbo.com/specials/coastal-elites),” a series of
monologues, was also intended for the stage. But when theaters shut down
in March, he turned it into a comedy special for HBO. Streaming this
weekend, the star-studded event (including Bette Midler and Issa Rae)
will feature various “elites” speaking to others via screens as they
navigate the pandemic and the current political landscape. They Zoom
with therapists and friends, or record YouTube segments. At one point, a
mindfulness coach has a breakdown while filming a meditation video.

“There isn’t anything funny about death or terrible illnesses, but human
beings are funny,” Mr. Rudnick said. “And we were able to assemble an
extraordinary cast because theater people like to work but nobody can
right now.”

Mr. Rudnick, 62, also a novelist, screenwriter and regular contributor
to [The New
Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/paul-rudnick), spends
much of his time in the West Village, in an apartment he has owned for
25 years, with his partner, Dr. John Raftis, 67, who specializes in
rehabilitative medicine. They also have an apartment near City Hall and
a home in Port Jefferson, Long Island.

**WORK FROM HOME** My happiest Sunday in a very long time was in July —
our final day of filming: 6 a.m., spread out with all my Zoom and
[QTake](https://qtakehd.com/) screens, texting with the director Jay
Roach, while we watched Bette go from comic bliss to total tears. These
days, entertainment occurs with a distilled efficiency you didn’t get on
a movie set with tons of people around. You’re rarely just sitting
around waiting anymore. But it’s sad there are no brunches, and very
little gossip, usually show-business plasma.

**CARBS** On a more usual Sunday, John gets up around 7; I stumble out
of bed by 8. Before the pandemic, we were big
[IHOP](https://www.ihop.com/en/restaurants-new-york-ny/235-e-14th-st--237-3357)
guys. Sometimes you feel you have to defend it — and I will to the death
because I was raised in New Jersey. But we haven’t become big outdoor
dining guys, so I’ll just heat up a Thomas’s [corn
Toast-R-Cake](https://thomasbreads.com/products/corn-toast-r-cakes).
It’s like a large poker chip made out of
cornbread.

**PERSONAL WEATHER REPORT** I can’t claim to understand this, but John
is a weather junkie. Saves the log from our New York Times every Sunday
going back decades, archived on our bookshelves. You can ask him, what
was the weather like in 1982? It’s like living with Wikipedia.

**TO EACH HIS OWN** One secret of any lasting relationship is to not try
to change each other. John knew from our first date 27 years ago that I
have the strangest diet of almost any human. So John cooks for himself
with balsamic vinegars and other things I would never go near. We have
our separate ends of the table.

**THE DINING ROOM TABLE** You look at John’s end of the table: a plate,
utensils, stemware. My end usually looks more like a child’s birthday
party: sprinkles, frosting, paper goods. This has never bothered me in
the slightest, and I think some people have a secret envy because I can
subsist pretty much on crap. For example, I go through very extreme
Pringles phases. Not the flavored varieties, though. Your classic
Pringle. I love that it’s a food that stacks. I went through a period
where I saved all those canisters because I had this idea of creating
furniture out of them. And still feel that’s a valid — and eco-friendly
—
idea.

**SERENITY LATER** I’m a big Gothic guy. Visual artists I know —
painters, sculptors, filmmakers — tend to work in serene backdrops. In
big white rooms without any clutter. I’m the opposite. I like to look up
and see lots of color and distractions. Gothic is real good for that.
Gnomes and knights and dragons staring right back at you. I come from a
big family of shoppers, whom I paid tribute to in my novel [“I’ll Take
It.”](https://www.amazon.com/Ill-Take-Paul-Rudnick/dp/034536225X/ref=tmm_mmp_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1598973991&sr=1-1)
But I’ve only been buying surgical gloves and books lately. I’ve had
this apartment for 25 years; at this point it’s overstuffed with gothic
everything.

**THE PROCESS** In a way, everybody’s on this freelance schedule now
where — as with most writers — you’re never sure if you’re allowed a
weekend. My first and most emotional draft is always longhand in big
yellow legal pads, lying on the living room couch with a big pen. Just
grabbing Frosted Flakes out of the box and water out of the big Poland
Spring. Then I think, “OK, it might be lunchtime.” But I just keep
going.

**FRESH AIR** I miss going to the gym. Though I do run *to* and *around*
the gym every day. The mile-long stretch up the Hudson to Chelsea Piers
centers me, even though I don’t go in. It’s big and above ground — New
York gyms can sometimes feel subterranean. It’s been fascinating passing
[Little Island](https://littleisland.org/) that Barry Diller’s putting
in the river there — it’s being landscaped with enormous trees now.
Getting to watch architecture happen is part of what I love about living
here. [Jefferson Market
Library](https://timesmachine.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/timesmachine/1967/05/07/83598670.html?pageNumber=386)
on Sixth Avenue at Christopher Street is my favorite building. There is
a big Victorian Gothic tower and turret; it’s an inspiring little Harry
Potter corner. I walk by there when I’m getting Gristedes
groceries.

**WARDROBE** By the time evening rolls around, we’re ready for Netflix.
Wish this were only true during the pandemic, but I tend to go to bed in
whatever I wore that day. The great American uniform: ancient navy blue
J. Crew sweatpants and white socks. That’s where we all are right now —
the line between sleepwear and workwear, erased. John has insomnia, but
before I conk out at 1 a.m. we’ll also watch a little “[House
Hunters](https://www.hgtv.com/shows/house-hunters)” on HGTV, which acts
as the ideal narcotic.
