Before the coronavirus pandemic, Britain’s tortuous debate on how to
exit the European Union — while maintaining all the perks of membership
— was a perennial of global news. The long-running political drama
went from one “final” Brexit deadline to the next until, at 11 p.m.
Coordinated Universal Time on Jan. 31, 2020, Britain left the union.

But not entirely. That moment started an [11-month
transition](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50838994) period during
which British and E.U. leaders were supposed to negotiate their future
relationship. Until that period is concluded, Britain remains in the
E.U. customs union and single market, and is bound by E.U. law, though
it is without a seat on any E.U. institution.

The talks have made no progress, and this week they descended into a
nasty dispute over a proposed British law that, in the words of an E.U.
executive, amounts to “an extremely serious violation” of international
law. E.U. leaders have demanded that the law be withdrawn; the British
say no way.

Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, who got elected 10 months ago
on the claim that he had an “oven-ready” Brexit deal, is now
[threatening to leave the European
Union](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-ireland.html),
with or without a deal, on Oct. 15. Mr. Johnson says that leaving
without a deal would be a “[good
outcome](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/world/europe/boris-johnson-brexit-northern-ireland.html)”
for Britain, a claim as ill-founded today as it was when the British
were on the brink of a deal-less exit last year.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The latest twist in the saga revolves around a bill recently introduced
by Mr. Johnson’s Conservative government that proposes to override a key
element in the withdrawal agreement that Mr. Johnson signed in January.
Not surprisingly, the problem is over Northern Ireland, the Gordian knot
that has bedeviled all negotiations past.

The question has been how to keep the border across Ireland open once
Britain, of which Northern Ireland is part, leaves the European Union.
As a fallback, the withdrawal treaty created some complex customs
arrangements between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain that would
go into effect if other arrangements were not agreed to. With that
possibility looming large, Mr. Johnson’s new law would effectively allow
Britain to decide on its own how to manage the movement of goods across
the Irish Sea. That, a Cabinet minister conceded, would break
international law, though only “[in a very specific and limited
way](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54073836).”

That qualifier has failed to prevent a brouhaha. Theresa May, who
wrestled bravely and futilely with Brexit as Mr. Johnson’s predecessor,
questioned why any future partner would trust Britain if it openly
violated its legal obligations.

Across the Atlantic, American politicians declared they would not permit
anything that might undo the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which ended
decades of sectarian strife in Ireland. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic
speaker of the House, warned on Wednesday that if Britain violated the
treaty there would be “absolutely no chance” of getting a U.S.-British
trade agreement through Congress. Mr. Johnson, it will be recalled, had
argued that leaving the European Union would allow Britain to strike a
better deal with the United States.

So much of the Brexit serial is back, yet again: the “final” deadlines,
the brinkmanship, the talk of a “hard” (read no-deal) Brexit, the
grumbling in Brussels about British intransigence, the spat over the
Irish border.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

If the soundtrack is familiar, however, the background is far different.
An economic crisis spawned by the coronavirus pandemic has diminished
the popularity of Mr. Johnson and his Conservatives. The European Union
has shown no sign of yielding on key issues — state subsidies for
British industry and fishing rights. President Trump, an ardent
supporter of Brexit, is facing a tough re-election battle. The
opposition Labour Party is now led by [Keir
Starmer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/04/world/europe/labour-party-keir-starmer.html),
who is regarded as a greater challenge to Conservatives than his
predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. And with a no-deal exit looking more likely,
polls in Scotland have shown a sharp uptick in support for independence.

The hard fact is that without a deal there can be no good outcome. A
no-deal Brexit would mean that as of Jan. 1, 2021, there will be tariffs
and border checks, higher prices for many goods, long lines of trucks at
the English Channel. The British service industry would lose guaranteed
access to the European Union, affecting numerous people ranging from
bankers to musicians.

All these consequences have been endlessly hashed over since the British
voted for Brexit in a referendum in June 2016. But four years of
anguished debates and wrenching negotiations appear to have done little
to close the gap between those who see membership in the European Union
as a leash on British sovereignty — as demonstrated recently when
Britain’s chief negotiator, David Frost, snapped that Britain would
never become a “[client
state](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54045653)” of the union —
and those who view the union as a community of shared economic rules and
common values that benefit both sides.

Mr. Johnson was thrust into office less on the strength of his often
theatrical speaking skills than on fatigue with the Brexit process.
Breaking the withdrawal treaty is not the way forward, and that dodge
should be abandoned. There is still time, and it would be best for
Britain and the Continent if Mr. Johnson were to use that time to reach
a deal that would adhere to international law and minimize the
disruption of a painful separation.
