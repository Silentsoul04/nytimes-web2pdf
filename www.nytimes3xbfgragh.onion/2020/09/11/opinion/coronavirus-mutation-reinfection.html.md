SYDNEY, Australia — No doubt you have read the recent headlines about
patients who recovered from Covid-19 only to be infected with SARS-CoV-2
again later — purportedly by a different
“[strain](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200803105246.htm)”
of the virus.

In late August came news alerts about the world’s first
“[documented](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/health/coronavirus-reinfection.html)”
or
“[confirmed](https://www.physiciansweekly.com/worlds-first-confirmed-case-of-covid-19-reinfection-reported-in-hong-kong/)”
case of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2: a man from Hong Kong, diagnosed in
March, had contracted “[a new
virus](https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/covid-19-reinfection-first-instance-recorded-in-hong-kong)”
circulating in Western Europe this summer. The very next day, news broke
that [two people in
Europe](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html#link-f61c099)
also appeared to have been reinfected.

After that, it was
[stories](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-19-reinfection-reported-nevada-patient-researchers-say-n1238679)
about the [first American case of the
kind](https://www.foxnews.com/health/first-coronavirus-reinfection-case-us-nevada)
— involving a patient in Nevada said to have suffered worse symptoms the
second time around. The preprint study (not peer-reviewed) on which
those reports were based [seems to no longer be
available.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3681489)

All this talk about new, perhaps more virulent, forms of SARS-CoV-2 is
unnecessarily sparking fear and sowing confusion.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Let’s consider the evidence and the science.

For one thing, isolated cases of reinfection also happen with other
viruses. That fact is not [necessarily
alarming](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/opinion/coronavirus-antibodies-immunity.html?searchResultPosition=3).
Reinfection usually tells us something only about how the human immune
system works. It is not, on the face of it, evidence that a virus has
mutated in ways that make it more dangerous.

For another thing, viruses routinely mutate — and most of these changes
are bad for the virus or even fatal, [according to some
studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC420405/). (A
minority of mutations are neutral, and only a tiny minority beneficial.)
The word “mutation” may sound ominous, but it is a humdrum fact of viral
life and its implications most often aren’t nefarious for humans.

And yes, SARS-CoV-2 is mutating, too. So what?

The real question is this: Has it become more virulent or more
infectious than it was when it was first detected in Wuhan, central
China, in December? The evidence suggests that it has not.

Like the viruses that give us influenza or measles, SARS-CoV-2 has a
genetic code made up of RNA, or ribonucleic acid. But RNA is highly
mutable, and since SARS-CoV-2 infects us by using our body’s cells to
replicate itself again and again, every time its genome is copied, an
error might creep in.

Most mutations are quickly lost, either by chance or because they damage
some part of the virus’s main functions. Only a small proportion end up
spreading widely or lasting. Mutation may be the fuel of evolution but,
especially for an RNA virus, it also is just business as usual.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

RNA viruses tend to evolve rapidly — about [a million times faster than
human
genes](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000003).
Yet if SARS-CoV-2 stands out among them, it is for evolving more slowly
than many: about [five times less rapidly than the influenza
viruses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.077735v1.abstract),
for example.

According to [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/), an open-source
project that tracks the evolution of pathogens in real time, and [other
sources](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/pandemic-virus-slowly-mutating-it-getting-more-dangerous),
SARS-CoV-2 is accumulating an average of about two mutations per month —
which means that the forms of the virus circulating today are only about
15 mutations or so different from the first version traced to the
outbreak in Wuhan.

This is a tiny number considering that the SARS-CoV-2’s genome is about
30,000 nucleotides long. And it means, too, that the versions of the
virus today are roughly 99.95 percent the same as the Wuhan original.
For an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is in the slow lane of evolution.

(So talk about SARS-CoV-2 having developed into however many different
“strains” is
[misleading](https://www.virology.ws/2020/05/07/there-is-one-and-only-one-strain-of-sars-cov-2/).
Scientists tend to reserve the word for versions of a virus that differ
in major biological ways. SARS-CoV-2’s different forms are very similar;
better to call them “variants.”)

The coronavirus’s sluggish pace of mutation is good news for us: A virus
that evolved more rapidly would have a greater chance of outrunning any
vaccines or drugs developed to counter it.

That said, have even the small mutations so far changed SARS-CoV-2 in
any important ways?

For example, has it become more deadly?

To my knowledge, there is to date no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has become
more virulent or more lethal — nor, for that matter, that it has become
less so.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

For example, a recent [preprint
paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20166082v2)
(not yet peer-reviewed) by Erik Volz, of the faculty of medicine at
Imperial College in London, and numerous colleagues at other
institutions — including members of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium
— which analyzed 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in
the United Kingdom, found that one particular mutation in the virus,
known as D614G, had not increased mortality in patients.

What about infectivity?

There has
[been](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/science/coronavirus-mutation-genetics-spike.html)
[much](https://medium.com/microbial-instincts/what-the-d614g-mutation-means-for-covid-19-spread-fatality-treatment-and-vaccine-7dda1c066f0d)
[discussion](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/new-coronavirus-strain-infectious-does-not-make-people-sicker-study-2020-7?r=US&IR=T)
over whether the D614G mutation — which affects the so-called spike
protein of the virus — has made SARS-CoV-2 more infectious.

The spike protein sits on the surface of the coronavirus, and it matters
because it’s the part of the virus that attaches to the host’s cells.
“D614G” is shorthand for a change at position 614 of the spike
protein, from an aspartic acid (D) to a glycine amino acid (G). (The
technical literature refers to “D614” as the earlier configuration and
“G614” as the later one.)

The D614G mutation, which probably initially arose in China, first
appeared to become more and more frequent in the outbreak in northern
Italy in February. The G614 form of the virus has since spread all over
the world and has become the dominant variant.

The D614G mutation does seem to have increased the infectivity of the
coronavirus — [at least in cells grown in
laboratories](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2020/20200611-choe-farzan-sars-cov-2-spike-protein.html),
according to [a recent paper by the computational biologist Bette Korber
and others](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674\(20\)30820-5.pdf)
published in the journal Cell.

Apparently based partly on this and [other
studies](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2020/20200611-choe-farzan-sars-cov-2-spike-protein.html),
[health
authorities](https://www.todayonline.com/world/10-times-more-infectious-d614g-coronavirus-strain-detected-malaysia)
in [various
countries](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ten-times-more-infectious-than-coronavirus-all-you-need-to-know-about-d614g/articleshow/77586073.cms)
have claimed that the G614 form of the coronavirus may be 10 times more
infectious than the version first detected in Wuhan.

But as [some epidemiologists have
warned](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\(20\)30817-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420308175%3Fshowall%3Dtrue),
it is difficult, not to mention unwise, to extrapolate from lab results
to explain how the virus actually spreads in a real population.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I do not believe that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is what’s driving the
virus’s continued spread. The coronavirus remains good at propagating
itself because most of us still are susceptible to it; we are not
immune, and it can still find new hosts to infect relatively easily.

In the same issue of Cell that published the Korber paper, the viral
epidemiologist Nathan Grubaugh and colleagues argued that the “increase
in the frequency of G614 could be explained by chance and the
epidemiology of the pandemic.”

I agree.

In other words: The next time you compare different outbreaks and start
wondering or worrying about the variations, assume first that those
variations have to do with conditions on the ground, rather than
anything about the virus itself, like a new mutation.

Consider, for example, the wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections that has hit
Australia since June. While there has been a major outbreak in the state
of Victoria (peaking [at around 700 cases per
day](https://www.covid19data.com.au/victoria)), the one in the state of
New South Wales has been minor so far (with [a daily case count usually
around 10](https://www.covid19data.com.au/transmission-sources-states))
— yet both have been caused by the same variant of the coronavirus,
the one with the D614G mutation.

The precise reasons for these differences are still being investigated,
but one may be, simply, that because [the outbreak hit Victoria
first](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/28/victoria-covid-hotel-quarantine-inquiry-hears-guest-escaped-to-lobby-as-security-guard-was-on-his-phone),
the health authorities of New South Wales had more time to prepare.

Mortality rates, too, [differ between
locations](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), and in some
places the virus may appear to kill more people. But again, these
variations probably say less about the virus than about differences in
how the disease is being treated, or where the virus has spread mostly
among vulnerable populations, like [people in nursing
homes](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/07/revealed-more-than-40-of-victorian-coronavirus-aged-care-deaths-were-residents-in-just-10-homes).

What’s more, even if the D614G mutation does increase the virus’s
infectivity in humans, that fact probably doesn’t have any major
implications for our prospects of developing an effective vaccine. The
mutation does affect the spike protein, but [not the part of it that the
neutralizing antibodies of the human immune system
target](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/28/2008281117) when
the body defends itself against infection.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Viruses mutate constantly; SARS-CoV-2 is no different. And it’s
essential that we continue to monitor when and how, and with what
effects, it is evolving.

Whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more infectious or more deadly are
important questions, all the more so because it doesn’t look like this
virus will be eradicated any time soon. More likely, it will become a
pathogen endemic in humans, as everyday as influenza.

For now, though, SARS-CoV-2 essentially is the same virus that emerged
in December. Sure, it has mutated, but not, so far, in ways that **
should change how scientists think about how to tackle it — and not in
ways that should worry you.
