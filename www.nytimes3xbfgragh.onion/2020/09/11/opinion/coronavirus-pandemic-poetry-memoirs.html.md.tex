Memoirs}\label{the-pandemic-in-six-word-memoirs}}

``The world has never felt smaller.''

By Larry Smith

Mr. Smith is the creator of Six Word Memoirs.

Since 2006, I've been challenging people to describe their lives in six
words, a form I call \href{https://www.sixwordmemoirs.com/}{the six-word
memoir} --- a personal twist on the legendary six-word story attributed
to Ernest Hemingway: ``For sale: baby shoes, never worn.''

I've found that some of the most memorable six-word stories arise in the
extremes --- during our toughest and most joyous moments. So over the
past several months, I've asked adults and children around the country
to use the form to make sense of this moment in history: one person, one
story, and six words at a time.
