# Remembering the Presidency of Donald Trump

</div>

I wish it were a fever dream in my Covid-clouded mind. But, no, our
president believes empathy, like patriotic sacrifice, is for suckers.

After two weeks of battling Covid-19 — thank you, dear readers, for all
the good wishes — I can report that the droning discomfort has passed,
some energy has returned, I can taste again, and, for better or worse, I
am recovering my personality from whoever hijacked it. I can also
certify that the virus is a devilish addition to life on earth. Do not
mess with it.

My memory is also returning, a mixed blessing as it turns to familiar
obsessions, like Trump’s ego.

You know that ego could not resist 18 interviews with Bob Woodward, just
as you know that he spent some of those interviews detailing his lies to
the American people about the virus (he preferred “[to always play it
down](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/bob-woodward-finally-got-trump-to-tell-the-truth-about-covid-19)”),
just as you know that he said in 2018 that the Aisne-Marne American
cemetery in France he declined to visit was “[filled with
losers](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/),”
just as you know that [in 2017 he
said](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html)
Haitians “all have AIDS” and Nigerian immigrants wouldn’t ever “go back
to their huts.”

You know because the president’s personality is consistent: a mix of
coward, racist, liar, con artist, narcissist, grifter, and blowhard,
with uncanny antennae for the worst instincts of humanity, and for how
to use the media to channel insecurity and hatred into a mass political
movement galvanized by his fiendish energy.

Yes, you just know with Trump. You know he insisted that Sean Spicer say
his inauguration was “[the largest audience to ever
witness](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/20/sean-spicer-may-be-done-with-press-briefings-here-are-his-greatest-hits/)”
the ceremony, and that the former senior White House counselor Kellyanne
Conway used the Trump playbook when she said the statement was not false
but “[just alternative
facts](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/conway-press-secretary-gave-alternative-facts-860142147643),”
and that when Trump started insisting (falsely) that there [had been
voter
fraud](https://apnews.com/f5f6a73b2af546ee97816bb35e82c18d/Report:-Trump-commission-did-not-find-widespread-voter-fraud)
*in the election he had won*, he was laying the groundwork for real
voter suppression in November 2020, and that downplaying the virus was
about getting the [Dow
to 30,000](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html)
so he would not suffer an *impossible defeat* in the coming election.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Alternative facts have been the diet of Americans for 44 months now. No
democracy, built on accountability and law, can survive such an
onslaught indefinitely. That is why Joe Biden’s most effective slogan is
a simple one: “You deserve a president who tells you the truth.”

Biden has a fight on his hands. Millions of Americans have lost their
jobs. Militarized police confront angry mobs. Insecurity is rampant, as
is racial tension. A plague stalks the land. These are near perfect
conditions for a proto-fascist like Trump who seeks a disoriented
populace.

You just know, and the knowledge is that cloying glob of sludge that can
never quite be washed off in the Trump era, however hard you scrub. It
permeates existence.

You know he doesn’t believe climate change is a threat, that he has done
his best [to
eviscerate](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/trump-administration-environmental-rollbacks-epa-coronavirus/)
the Environmental Protection Agency, that he does not believe in
science, that he thought “disinfectant” might [knock
out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfLZOkn0chc) the virus “in a
minute,” that he has hobbled the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, that he [couldn’t care
less](https://transequality.org/the-discrimination-administration)about
transgender people, that he loathes immigrants he has described as
“animals,” and that he authorized [the
separation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/14/the-weekly/trump-immigration-border-separation-family.html)
of thousands of immigrant children from their parents at the border. You
know that in textbook totalitarian fashion, calls a free press “the
[enemy of the American
people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/07/donald-trump-war-on-the-media-oppo-research).”

Yes, you know, and you also know that Trump wants you to know all this
so well, and so relentlessly, ** that you don’t care. He has always
gotten away with it. He has no reason to believe he will not continue to
bat 1.000.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The fact is, we’re here, and they’re not,” [he
taunted](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DMevLAJjmhIk&sa=D&ust=1599842045176000&usg=AFQjCNF2cwD4C8GClxHCHqhBtBoTu_iNPg)
his opponents at the White House last month. It is a fact, alterable
only through an immense summoning of American character and will.

You know Trump thought there were “[very fine people on both
sides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmaZR8E12bs&feature=emb_title)”
at the 2017 neo-Nazi Charlottesville rally, and that he thinks any Jew
who votes for a Democrat shows “[great
disloyalty,](https://apnews.com/1bc3065eb2e4414289ef0ac1ac4ebaf7)” and
that he winks daily at millions of Americans who believe he is their
savior from a takeover by Black and brown people, Jewish finance,
cosmopolitans, and leftist radicals. You know Trump is “[very much
behind](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/us/politics/100000005024000/trump-we-are-very-much-behind-egypt.html)”
President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt because he has yet to meet a
dictator he does not dream of emulating. You know Trump must be
compromised with President Vladimir Putin to the point of
[ignoring](https://www.axios.com/trump-russia-bounties-taliban-putin-call-4a0f6110-ab58-41c0-96fc-57b507462af1.html)
Russian bounties on American troops in Afghanistan.

American deaths, as this year’s virus death toll has shown, are a matter
of indifference to a president who believes empathy, like patriotic
sacrifice, is for suckers.

It’s important not just to know, to be aware, but to remember. It’s hard
to remember. It’s like looking for the way out of a labyrinth in the
mist.

It’s important to remember that Trump
[believes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/05/trumps-claim-that-hes-done-more-blacks-than-any-president-since-lincoln/)
he has done more for Black Americans than any president since Abraham
Lincoln and that [he
claims](https://apnews.com/5707eb98847a3c69632a2eea2e03a475) he will
preserve coverage for pre-existing conditions even as he is asking the
Supreme Court to destroy Obamacare.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Because Trump is delusional and a world already on the brink of
an armed Chinese-American confrontation may not survive a second Trump
term without disaster. Nor will the oldest democracy on earth.
