If your idea of a dream home includes a combination of golf, nature,
quality architecture and fine wine, there are master-planned communities
around the world offering the best of all four.

“Some of the top golf clubs in the world also have some of the finest
wine cellars,” said Greg Nathan, chief business officer of the [National
Golf Foundation](https://www.ngf.org/).

Perhaps the combination shouldn’t be a surprise: The British Open’s
coveted trophy is in the shape of a claret jug after all — traditionally
used to serve Bordeaux wine in the 19th century. And top golfers like
Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Ernie Els, David Frost and Luke Donald all
have their own wine labels, said Paul T. Stringer, president of
[Nicklaus Design](https://www.nicklausdesign.com/).

Here is a selection of lifestyle-driven communities tailored to bons
vivants looking for world-class chipping and sipping in breathtaking
settings.

## Italy

Set in the Tuscan hills where the Medici family used to holiday,
[Toscana Resort Castelfalfi](https://www.castelfalfi.com/) offers a
taste of la dolce vita. The fertile 2,700-acre retreat is a patchwork of
vineyards, olive groves, lakes and woodlands centered on a medieval
village of stone structures outfitted with modern amenities.

“Unlike other golf-driven communities, this doesn’t have a suburban
feel,” said Marco Boni, a homeowner who lives in Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates.

Six sites for villas overlooking the golf course start at 1.7 million
euros (about $2 million) for a 2,580-square-foot property. New
constructions (a rarity in Tuscany) must adhere to strict green-building
codes. For those looking for a fixer-upper, 14 additional farmhouse
ruins, some dating to the 15th century, are scattered throughout the
property and are available for restoration. Refurbishment (conducted
through the resort) costs about €740 per square foot. (Homeowners’
resort fees start at €4,000 per year.)

Two hillside golf courses span about 32,000 square feet across varied
terrain. Designed by Wilfried Moroder and Rainer Preissmann, the 18-hole
Mountain Course tests veteran golfers while the nine-hole Lake Course
caters to beginners.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“If I didn’t play golf, I’d walk the course every day because the views
are so visually arresting,” said Tim Wade, a homeowner who lives in
London.

To enjoy the literal fruits of Tuscany, homeowners can adopt a row of
grape vines or an olive grove to receive personalized bottles of wine or
extra-virgin olive oil refined at the on-site organic winery. Homeowners
also have exclusive access to wine tours, tastings and discounts on the
resort’s various wine labels.

## South Africa

The 2,265-acre [Val de Vie](https://valdevie.co.za/) estate is in the

of Val de Vie and owner of the on-site winery, [L’Huguenot
Cellar](https://valdevie.co.za/wine/cellar/), which produces the

“Our house is low-slung and built with local schist stone, dark-stained
timber and a flat roof covered with pebbles to blend into the natural
landscape,” said Jude Roberts, a full-time resident whose sun-drenched
four-bedroom home overlooks the vista.

The developer said residents were attracted to Jack’s Point for its four
distinct seasons and recreational facilities, which include tennis,
water sports, 15.5 miles of trails, local golf courses and ski resorts.

Oenophiles can taste the terroir at Gibbston, a nearby wine-growing
region famous for its pinot noir and home to dozens of wineries and wine
