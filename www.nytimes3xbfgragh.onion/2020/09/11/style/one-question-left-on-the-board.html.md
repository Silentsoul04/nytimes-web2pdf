Shortly after they began dating, Lina-Marie Mano and Andrew Silvestri
started playing a game called 20 questions.

“We made individual lists of 20 questions that we could ask each other
any time we wanted,” said Mr. Silvestri, 34, the head of data center
public policy and community development at Google in Oklahoma City.

“We made a rule that no matter the question, we had to be totally honest
with our answers,” he said. “It was a nice way to clear the air about a
lot of things, or to simply learn new things, or to possibly come to
know more about each other than we had previously known.”

Ms. Mano learned just how good Mr. Silvestri was at playing the game
when he fielded her first question — “Do you prefer dating blondes or
brunettes?,” a little too smoothly.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

“Well,” he said, proceeding to burn a short, exaggerated stare at her
long dark hair, “I definitely prefer brunettes.”

Ms. Mano wasn’t thrilled. “I guess I wasted that question,” she said.

Several other questions, especially those regarding past relationships,
produced the kind of delicate answers that took the couple from
frivolity to fragility.

“Those questions didn’t always go over so well, but that was the point,”
said Ms. Mano, 35, the senior merchandise planner in fine apparel and
couture collections for the Neiman Marcus Group in Dallas. “The whole
idea was to create question-and-answer sessions that brought new
information into our conversations,” she said, “or at the very least,
added much more depth and insight to anything we chatted about. It was
great.”

Ms. Mano and Mr. Silvestri met in Oklahoma City on Halloween in 2016.

Mr. Silvestri had just returned from a failed date, and began telling
anyone within earshot, including Ms. Mano, all about it. “I was on a
Bumble date, appropriately enough,” he said. “The plan was to go out for
drinks and then to dinner, but midway through the date, we both knew it
wasn’t going anywhere, so we decided to cut the evening short right then
and there.”

After the woeful tale, he was introduced to Ms. Mano.

“Hey, are you single,” he asked, “Why don’t we go out?”

Ms. Mano recalled “laughing it off and then ignoring him.”

“I actually thought he was funny and very cute,” she added, “but I
didn’t think he really meant what he said, because he lived in
Oklahoma City and I lived in Dallas.”

Yet before going their separate ways, they both felt they had made an
immediate connection, having spent a few hours telling stories and
laughing with one another.

They began building a friendship via text messages, and began learning
even more about each other.

Mr. Silvestri was born to a Mexican mother, Rosana Elias Silvestri, and
an Italian father, Dr. Paul Silvestri, a psychologist, who lived in
Tucson, Ariz. He told Ms. Mano that he graduated from Oklahoma Christian
University and received a Master in Public Policy from Harvard.

Ms. Mano is a daughter of a French mother, Marie-Pierre Mano, and a
Japanese father, Dr. Noriyuki Mano, an orthopedic surgeon, who lived in
Orlando, Fla. Ms. Mano had graduated from Auburn University and received
a master’s degree in international business at Grenoble Graduate School
of Business in
Paris.

“I was really more interested in her than she was in me,” Mr. Silvestri
said. “But she was so beautiful and smart, and well worth pursuing.”

On Nov. 18 2016, Mr. Silvestri’s 31st birthday, he decided to call Ms.
Mano and ask her to dinner. When her voice began to sputter, he said,
“Come on, you can’t say no, it’s my birthday.”

She said yes, setting into motion a long-distance relationship that
began with a first date at a restaurant in Oklahoma City. They were part
of a larger group that night, all of whom heard Ms. Mano continually
call Mr. Silvestri, “Alex,” the name of a mutual friend who was already
a part of the group.

Mr. Silvestri laughed it off, as did Ms. Mano, and the next night, he
took her to an Oklahoma City basketball game against the visiting
Phoenix Suns.

“My big fear was that we were going to end up on the Kiss Cam,” Ms. Mano
said. “Thankfully that didn’t happen.”

Kiss or no kiss, Mr. Silvestri said: “I fell for her pretty fast and
pretty
hard.

In January 2017, he asked her to be his girlfriend, and her response had
them both laughing once more. “She told me that she would not officially
become my girlfriend until we went on 25 dates,” Mr. Silvestri said. “So
I started keeping track.”

Through chuckles, Ms. Mano denied issuing the 25-date edict, and began
seeing Mr. Silvestri on a fairly regular basis.

One morning in March 2017, Ms. Mano and Mr. Silvestri began making plans
for a trip to the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, one of Mr. Silvestri’s
favorite places.

“There is always such a hectic scene there,” he said. “But if you go
around to the back of the memorial, which faces Virginia and the river,
it’s like a different world, so peaceful and quiet.

“When I was in college, I always imagined bringing my future wife
there,” he added.

On the day of the trip, Mr. Silvestri delighted in telling Ms. Mano that
it just so happened to be Date No. 25, reminding her, as per their
arrangement, that she was officially his girlfriend.

“I had no idea he was actually counting our dates,” Ms. Mano said.

They were soon walking hand in hand behind the Lincoln Memorial, where
Mr. Silvestri told his newly minted girlfriend for the very first time
that he loved her.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

She returned the L-word immediately.

“When Lina came into my life, I was running around about 100 miles per
hour, like a madman, always dealing with work or education-related
issues,” Mr. Silvestri said. “But she centered my spirit, allowing me to
calm down and refocus, and to realize that nothing is more important
than family.”

Ms. Mano credited Mr. Silvestri “with kind of pushing me to be a more
open and strong person.”

“I’m sort of shy,” she said, “but Andrew pushes me out of my comfort
zone sometimes and allows me to have a voice.”

Two years later, in January 2019, the couple returned to the Lincoln
Memorial, and this time, Mr. Silvestri dropped to one knee, and asked
Ms. Mano Question No. 19 on his 20-question list: “Will you marry me?”

Then, in August 2019, Mr. Silvestri, the youngest of three children, was
dealt a crushing blow when his mother died from complications of
pancreatic cancer.

“Our getting engaged was a moment for us to really celebrate life and
take advantage of family, then suddenly, my mom was not there to help us
celebrate,” said Mr. Silvestri, beginning to cry. “It was just
devastating.”

Ms. Mano, who has an older sister, said “losing his mother only made
Andrew lean heavier on family.”

“If he’s not around family,” she said, “he’s usually trying to get
family together.”

They were married July 25 at the Oklahoma Contemporary Arts Center in
Oklahoma City before 100 guests. The groom’s father, Paul Silvestri, who
was ordained by Church of Christ, officiated. The coronavirus forced the
couple to drop their original wedding date, March 21, and to shave 150
family members and friends from their guest list.

“Andrew and Lina, in just a few minutes you are going to step into a
life that is full of new possibilities, new dreams and new hopes,” the
groom’s father said. “You see, this marriage was in the making nearly 35
years ago beginning on the day Andrew was born.

“I don’t think a day passed by where we didn’t pray and ask God to bring
just the right woman for Andrew to marry and asking God to also prepare
Andrew to be the right man for the woman he chose,” he told the bride.
“You are God’s answer to all these years of prayer and we couldn’t be
happier.”

Neither could the newlyweds, who, according to the rules of a game they
began playing four years earlier, still have one question left to ask
each
other.
