# Fauci Says It Could Be a Year Before Theater Without Masks Feels Normal

</div>

Dr. Anthony Fauci said a vaccine would need to exist for nearly a year
before people might feel comfortable returning to theaters unmasked,
which he said would likely be mid- to late 2021.

As theaters look to see how they might reopen with safety accommodations
including mask use, Dr. Anthony Fauci says it will likely be more than a
year before people feel comfortable returning to theaters without masks.

“If we get a really good vaccine and just about everybody gets
vaccinated,” he said in an [Instagram Live
interview](https://www.instagram.com/p/CE7tWzinTI8/) with Jennifer
Garner on Wednesday, “you’ll have a degree of immunity in the general
community that I think you can walk into a theater without a mask and
feel like it’s comfortable that you’re not going to be at risk.”

He said that would likely not be until mid- to late 2021.

But that doesn’t mean he is saying when it would be safe to go to the
theater without a mask. Dr. Fauci, the country’s leading infectious
disease expert, clarified in a phone interview on Friday that he was
referring to when people could return to theatergoing at their
pre-coronavirus comfort levels. “Words like ‘safe’ are charged,” he
said. “I’m talking about the general trend of when we’ll start to feel
comfortable going back to normal if we get a safe and effective
vaccine.”

Dr. Fauci said that although a vaccine might be available as early as
the end of this year or the beginning of 2021, it would likely be well
into next year before enough people were vaccinated to ensure broad
protection.

But Dr. Fauci said that in [green-zone
areas](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/01/885263658/green-yellow-orange-or-red-this-new-tool-shows-covid-19-risk-in-your-county)
— those with very low community transmission — indoor theaters may be
able to return sooner if people wear masks. “As long as there is
infection in the community, you do not want indoor spaces with crowds,”
he said Friday. “But in states, cities or counties in the green zone
with low levels of infection, I imagine theaters could maybe open at 25
percent capacity, with people wearing masks, sometime as early as next
year.”

Experts said Dr. Fauci’s comments help set the expectation that the
coronavirus will be around for some time. “We should not be thinking of
the vaccine as a silver bullet,”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor
at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore’s
health commissioner, said Friday. “It will take months to vaccinate
hundreds of millions of people, and the vaccine may be, at best, 75
percent effective.”

Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at
Baylor College of Medicine, said the first vaccines “are not magic
solutions.”

“So we’ll likely still need to continue masks and contact tracing,” he
said.

The Broadway League said in a statement on Friday that it would continue
to put the health of employees and audiences first as it works to help
theaters reopen. “We are working closely with medical experts and
members of Governor Cuomo’s recovery team to ensure that all proper
health and safety protocols will be in place when the time comes to
reopen our theaters,” it said.

Producers have said they will refund all tickets purchased for
performances through Jan. 3. Some Broadway theaters are hoping to reopen
as soon as March — the earliest planned opening night right now is for
the Tracy Letts play “The Minutes,” which [is currently set for
March 15](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/theater/when-broadway-reopening-coronavirus.html).

Two more shows, a revival of David Mamet’s play “American Buffalo” and a
new show about Michael Jackson, “MJ the Musical,” aim to follow nearly a
month later on April 14 and 15. The much-anticipated revival of “The
Music Man,” headlined by Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, which was
originally set for the fall, now plans to open May 20.
