Normal}\label{fauci-says-it-could-be-a-year-before-theater-without-masks-feels-normal}}

Dr. Anthony Fauci said a vaccine would need to exist for nearly a year
before people might feel comfortable returning to theaters unmasked,
which he said would likely be mid- to late 2021.

As theaters look to see how they might reopen with safety accommodations
including mask use, Dr. Anthony Fauci says it will likely be more than a
year before people feel comfortable returning to theaters without masks.

``If we get a really good vaccine and just about everybody gets
vaccinated,'' he said in an
\href{https://www.instagram.com/p/CE7tWzinTI8/}{Instagram Live
interview} with Jennifer Garner on Wednesday, ``you'll have a degree of
immunity in the general community that I think you can walk into a
theater without a mask and feel like it's comfortable that you're not
going to be at risk.''

He said that would likely not be until mid- to late 2021.

But that doesn't mean he is saying when it would be safe to go to the
theater without a mask. Dr. Fauci, the country's leading infectious
disease expert, clarified in a phone interview on Friday that he was
referring to when people could return to theatergoing at their
pre-coronavirus comfort levels. ``Words like `safe' are charged,'' he
said. ``I'm talking about the general trend of when we'll start to feel
comfortable going back to normal if we get a safe and effective
vaccine.''

Dr. Fauci said that although a vaccine might be available as early as
the end of this year or the beginning of 2021, it would likely be well
into next year before enough people were vaccinated to ensure broad
protection.

But Dr. Fauci said that in
\href{https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/01/885263658/green-yellow-orange-or-red-this-new-tool-shows-covid-19-risk-in-your-county}{green-zone
areas} --- those with very low community transmission --- indoor
theaters may be able to return sooner if people wear masks. ``As long as
there is infection in the community, you do not want indoor spaces with
crowds,'' he said Friday. ``But in states, cities or counties in the
green zone with low levels of infection, I imagine theaters could maybe
open at 25 percent capacity, with people wearing masks, sometime as
early as next year.''

Experts said Dr. Fauci's comments help set the expectation that the
coronavirus will be around for some time. ``We should not be thinking of
the vaccine as a silver bullet,'' Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician
and public health professor at George Washington University who
previously served as Baltimore's health commissioner, said Friday. ``It
will take months to vaccinate hundreds of millions of people, and the
vaccine may be, at best, 75 percent effective.''

Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at
Baylor College of Medicine, said the first vaccines ``are not magic
solutions.''

``So we'll likely still need to continue masks and contact tracing,'' he
said.

The Broadway League said in a statement on Friday that it would continue
to put the health of employees and audiences first as it works to help
theaters reopen. ``We are working closely with medical experts and
members of Governor Cuomo's recovery team to ensure that all proper
health and safety protocols will be in place when the time comes to
reopen our theaters,'' it said.

Producers have said they will refund all tickets purchased for
performances through Jan. 3. Some Broadway theaters are hoping to reopen
as soon as March --- the earliest planned opening night right now is for
the Tracy Letts play ``The Minutes,'' which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/theater/when-broadway-reopening-coronavirus.html}{is
currently set for March 15}.

Two more shows, a revival of David Mamet's play ``American Buffalo'' and
a new show about Michael Jackson, ``MJ the Musical,'' aim to follow
nearly a month later on April 14 and 15. The much-anticipated revival of
``The Music Man,'' headlined by Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, which
was originally set for the fall, now plans to open May 20.
