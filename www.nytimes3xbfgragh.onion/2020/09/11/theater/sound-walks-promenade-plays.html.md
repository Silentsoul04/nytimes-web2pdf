# For These Shows, Take a Hike

If you participate in a sound walk and no one is there to applaud, does
it count as theater? Our critic argues that it does. Or at least that it
can.

There’s a moment late in [“Cairns,”](https://here.org/shows/cairns/) a
lovely, peaceable sound walk created by the singer and scholar [Gelsey
Bell](https://gelseybell.com/) and presented by Here, in which Bell will
ask you to do something drastic: Take out your earbuds. Maybe that
doesn’t seem so extreme, but when was the last time you put away your
phone, shut your eyes, stilled the mental whirl of worries, statistics
and undone errands, and just listened?

People who have tired of Zoom plays (don’t raise your hands all at once,
please\!), will welcome the opportunity to listen — outdoors and
screen-free. After all, if a sound walk doesn’t get you into the
theater, at least it gets you out of the house.

[Promenade
plays](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/theater/promenade-theater-walking-pandemic.html),
in which audience members walk from physically distanced scene to
physically distanced scene, have become a mainstay of pandemic theater.
In “Cairns” and [“Intralia, the Weird
Park,”](https://www.inversiontheatre.com/park) another recent audio
play, you still walk — for miles — but the scenes are staged in your
mind’s eye and mind’s ear only. These are participatory shows, but in a
solitary and covert way that seems like some kind of theatrical koan. If
you participate and no one is there to applaud, does it even count? I’d
argue that it does. Or at least that it can.

Since both sound walks take place in Brooklyn — “Cairns” in [Green-Wood
Cemetery](https://www.green-wood.com/) and “Intralia” in [Prospect
Park](https://www.prospectpark.org/), neither too far from my apartment
— I hiked them one after the other on a sunny Thursday. Actually, I
began the night before, buying Bell’s album on
[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) and downloading the tracks, plus a
map, onto my faltering Samsung Galaxy. The next morning, before the heat
kicked in, I slid on some sneakers, reached for a mask, tramped the two
and a half miles to Green-Wood’s Sunset Park entrance and clicked play.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

I’d seen Bell onstage, severe and sylphlike in the musicals [“Natasha,
Pierre and the Great Comet
of 1812”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/15/theater/natasha-pierre-and-the-great-comet-of-1812-review.html)
and [“Ghost
Quartet,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/11/theater/dave-malloys-ghost-quartet-at-the-bushwick-starr.html)
and knew enough of her experimental music to feel curious. Still, with
the anxieties of the last several months, a morning spent contemplating
mortality, however vanguard the accompaniment, didn’t hugely appeal.
Because at the end of the day, Green-Wood, a nature preserve and
sculpture garden — and in the 1850s, an insanely popular tourist
attraction — is still a
cemetery.

I shouldn’t have worried. Bell couches her work in deeply humane terms,
even as she looks beyond the human and toward the natural world. Even
the grimmer observations are somehow delightful. Passing beneath some
purple-leafed beeches, she wonders what these trees might think,
“watching us short-lived meat bags the way we watch humming birds.”

During the walk, which lasts a little over an hour, Bell stays virtually
by your side. An informed, supportive friend, she casts you as her
companion, lending an aural hand to pull you onto each new gravel path.
She gives precise and particular directions — take a soft left, make a
sharp right — and even someone like me, with the directional acumen of a
demagnetized compass, never felt lost.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Generously, Bell wants you to notice what she has noticed, and in that
spirit, she takes you past a few graves like that of Do-Hum-Me, an
Indigenous woman exhibited by the showman P.T. Barnum; or Eunice Newton
Foote, a 19th-century climate scientist; or Susan McKinney Smith
Steward, the first Black woman to become a doctor in New York state.
Bell also directs your eyes toward Lady Liberty, far away in the harbor,
and to the bottom of a headstone that reads, “Have an egg
cream.”

But she also leaves space for your explorations, encouraging you to
pause the audio whenever needed. Often, in music composed with Joseph
White, she lets her own talk give way to whispering, humming, chanting
as her voice loops atop itself. Moving from tree to tree and plot to
plot, she encourages you to make your own sense, your own story, your
own theater. And even though I’m a meditation dud, the five minutes she
asked me to spend just listening — to birds, leaves, an airplane,
insects that chittered like a bicycle with a playing card in its spokes
— left me feeling quieter.

Another two miles took me to the Ocean Avenue entrance to Prospect Park
and the opening track for “Intralia,” from [InVersion
Theater](https://www.inversiontheatre.com/), with music and sound design
by Jordan Hall. At least, I think that was where I was meant to begin.
“Intralia” exists as an app for iPhone users, but for the rest of us,
it’s a SoundCloud link and a sketchy map. The catch: There are nine
tracks and only six locations marked on the map.

The piece begins with an instrumental — ominous strings — then offers
some language apparently borrowed from E.P.A. Superfund site reports
regarding the nearby Gowanus Canal, describing dangerous contaminants.
What this has to do with Prospect Park, fed by the city’s aqueducts and
not the canal, is anyone’s guess. (Though the cyanobacteria that has
turned some of the park’s lakes and ponds a retina-jolting green seems a
likely source of
inspiration.)

A press released had described “Intralia” as a story of two municipal
workers, Eve and Ash, who confront strange doings. Except for a
throwaway line about the “good luck to be assigned here, Prospect Park,”
I would never have known it as the piece never bothers to establish
character or place. Other tracks reveal the discovery of entrails and
hanging goat heads. Which failed to feel creepy. Because while “Cairns”
entrenches itself in its surroundings, “Intralia” disregards them.

Those strings and scares elide what is authentically strange and really
beautiful about this particular urban park. Walking on what was maybe
the path, I saw anglers, bicyclists, CrossFit enthusiasts, children on
scooters, teenagers smoking weed, a man air-drying his laundry on a
piece of park equipment, and a lady acrobat balancing atop her partner’s
head. I saw a memorial for the [Battle of
Brooklyn](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/B073/highlights/19641) and
an [extremely pretty composting
toilet](https://www.prospectpark.org/news-events/news/alliance-transforms-historic-wellhouse/).
“Intralia” ignores them all.

The best examples of environmental theater (I’m thinking of pieces like
[“The Angel
Project”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2003/07/03/theater/theater-that-uses-the-city-as-a-stage.html)
and [“The Dreary
Coast”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/31/theater/the-dreary-coast-on-the-banks-of-the-gowanus-canal.html))
take a familiar place and make you see it through new eyes. But
“Intralia” didn’t seem to see the park at all, with no consideration
given to who you are and how and why you might be
listening.

I had hiked to the top of Lookout Hill — for a final track that never
mentioned it — and when “Intralia” ended, I hiked down then walked the
mile or so back home, alone again with my own internal soundtrack. (My
Samsung battery held out until I reached the road that rings the park,
then died.) I thought about how generous traditional theater is and how
the actors, designers and directors conspire to deliver a total work of
art. Sound walks don’t do that, but even within these constraints, a
good one, like “Cairns,” can conjure a world and a worldview, too.

Maybe this form seems stingy — no costumes, no lights, no tap numbers,
just a few words murmured in your ear — but advance the track and think
of it as generous instead, a reminder not only of how much theater can
give us, but how much it trusts us to imagine, too.
