Nonurgent medical procedures have seemed worth postponing in a pandemic.
This could pose long-term risks, health officials fear.

When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Americans vastly scaled back their
preventive health care, and there is little sign that this deferred care
will be made up.

Vaccinations dropped by nearly 60 percent in April, and almost no one
was getting a colonoscopy, according to new data from the nonprofit
Health Care Cost Institute.

The data, drawn from millions of health insurance claims, shows a
consistent pattern, whether it was prostate screenings or
contraceptives: Preventive care declined drastically this spring and, as
of late June, had not yet recovered to normal levels. Many types of such
care were still down by a third at the start of this summer, the most
recent data available shows, as Americans remained wary of visiting
hospitals and medical offices.

“The thing that jumped out at me was how similar all the patterns were,”
said Niall Brennan, the institute’s president. “The bottom was deeper
for some services than others, but the slope of the lines was pretty
similar no matter what service you picked.”

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Americans continued seeking care they couldn’t avoid — hospital
admissions for childbirth, for example, held steady — but skipped care
they could put off. More invasive preventive procedures, such as
mammograms and colonoscopies, showed the greatest
decline.

Colonoscopies, which are generally used to screen for colon cancer,
declined by 88 percent in mid-April and were still 33 percent lower than
normal at the end of June. Mammograms, which fell 77 percent at the
height of the pandemic, are still down 23
percent.

The numbers could change slightly as insurers continue to process health
providers’ claims. A small time lag probably explains why the data
currently shows births declining in June. As more data becomes
available, preventive services may show stronger recent increases.

The data shows how the pandemic has rippled outward from the intensive
care units that have cared for coronavirus patients to primary care
doctors and pediatricians, who have seen their practices upended by
patients’ reduced demand.

Critical childhood vaccinations for hepatitis, measles, whooping cough
and other diseases also declined significantly, a
[trend](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/health/coronavirus-measles-vaccines.html)
that had already begun to worry pediatricians earlier in the pandemic.
Of particular concern, measles vaccinations fell 73 percent in mid-April
and were still down 36 percent at the end of
June.

Measles was already [on the
rise](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1905099)in the United
States before this year, coinciding with the growing strength of the
anti-vaccination movement. The fact that fewer children have been
vaccinated because of coronavirus fears could worsen the trend.

But one preventive service stayed relatively steady through the
pandemic: pregnancy-related ultrasounds. Those declined slightly in
March and April but never fell more than 20 percent below 2019 levels.
Insertions of IUDs, one of the most effective birth control methods,
declined like other preventive care — raising the possibility of an
increase in pregnancies in coming months.

When the pandemic began, some experts predicted that a decline in care
would be followed by a boom in demand. Doctor’s offices might see
higher-than-normal visit numbers as patients made up for deferred care.

Six months into the pandemic, that hasn’t happened. Doctor visits appear
to be inching toward normal levels but not exceeding volumes seen in
recent years. Even if demand does increase in coming months, health
providers may have difficulty meeting it, as social distancing protocols
limit their capacity.

“The pandemic has not played out like any of us would have hoped, and we
don’t see that pattern,” said Ateev Mehrotra, associate professor of
health policy at Harvard Medical School. “Now it seems that the vast
majority of that deferred care will never come back.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Mehrotra has[recently
studied](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2020/aug/impact-covid-19-pandemic-outpatient-visits-changing-patterns-care-newest)
trends in doctor office visits using a different data set, and his work
also shows a significant drop-off in doctor visits, followed by an
incomplete rebound through mid-August.

While doctor visits for adults are much closer to normal numbers, those
for children were still 26 percent lower than normal as of a month ago.

Health researchers say it will take years to understand how the deferred
preventive care might affect health outcomes for Americans. Will fewer
colonoscopies, for example, translate into more cases of advanced colon
cancer? Will there be more outbreaks of communicable diseases because of
lower vaccination rates?

“Some of these are time-sensitive services,” said Eric Schneider, senior
vice president for research at the Commonwealth Fund. “Are we going to
see a little baby boomlet because women were unable to get family
planning services? These are services where you’d want to see a rebound
above the baseline, to get a sense the backlog was clearing. We don’t
see that, and it’s a concern.”
