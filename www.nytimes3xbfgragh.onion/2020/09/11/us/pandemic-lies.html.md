# Are You Lying More in the Pandemic? Some Certainly Are

The rate at which people are lying during the pandemic has increased,
experts suggest, perhaps because health-related matters are particularly
difficult to share.

As much of the United States moves toward reopening in phases, some
people are enjoying little bites of pre-pandemic life, such as dining in
restaurants, exercising in gyms and learning in classrooms. With the
gradual return comes a set of intrusive health questions: Are you
experiencing any symptoms? Have you been exposed to anyone who has
tested positive for the coronavirus? Answering those questions is where
it gets tricky.

People usually tell one to two lies a day, [according to a 1996
university
study](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.597.8906&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
Consistent with the belief that lying is an everyday social interaction,
participants said they did not view their lies as serious and did not
worry about being caught, the researchers said.

But what about lying during a pandemic that has [brought widespread
economic
damage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/upshot/virus-lasting-economic-effects.html)
and produced a [national health
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/12/us/covid-deaths-us.html)?

Incidents in which people were dishonest about their health have been
well documented over the last several months. In March, [a New York man
lied about his Covid-19
symptoms](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/03/31/rochester-ny-hospitals-tighten-visitor-policy-dad-hides-covid-19-symptoms-strong-highland/5085892002/)
to gain access to a maternity ward to see his wife, who later developed
flulike symptoms. The same month, a woman who flew from Massachusetts to
Los Angeles and then to Beijing [was placed under
investigation](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-18/woman-who-flew-from-u-s-to-china-for-coronavirus-test-faces-criminal-charges)
after she was accused of lying about her symptoms. In August, a woman in
Washington State was shamed for lying to her manicurist about [testing
positive for the
virus](https://www.allure.com/story/nail-client-exposes-manicurist-to-covid-19-virus-washington).

A recent Brock University study of 451 adults ages 20 to 82 living in
the United States found that people who believed they had contracted the
virus weren’t always honest. Thirty-four percent of Covid-19-positive
participants said they had denied having symptoms when asked by others,
and 55 percent reported some level of concealment of their
symptoms.

Twenty-five percent of participants reported that they had in some way
concealed their physical distancing practices; that rate increased among
those with Covid-19, according to the study, [published last month in
The Journal of Health
Psychology](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105320951603).
Women were more likely to disclose health symptoms than men were,
researchers said, and older adults were more honest about their Covid-19
status and behaviors.

But the exact reasoning behind lying during the pandemic is complicated
and may be related to the environment, according to David M. Castro, a
psychotherapist and adjunct professor of psychology at Adelphi
University and the City College of New York.

“I think that so much is barred from someone right now,” Dr. Castro
said. “There’s a lot of loneliness, a lot of depression stemming from
loneliness.” The fact that the current social environment may not
provide people what they need could tempt people to act in ways that get
them what they need, he added.

Robert Feldman, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst and the author of “[The Liar in Your
Life: The Way to Truthful
Relationships](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/robert-feldman/the-liar-in-your-life/9780446552196/),”
said that his research showed that people typically tell three lies
within the first 10 minutes of meeting someone else.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It’s part of what we do as members of society,” Professor Feldman said.
“We tell people that we’re feeling well when we’re not feeling so well.”

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Another common example of lying, he said, is saying that you liked a
gift you didn’t like.

“Society operates on lies in many ways,” Professor Feldman said. “Most
of these lies are probably fairly trivial in the grand scheme of things,
but they are lies.”

Professor Feldman said that he believed the number of lies people tell
had gone up during the pandemic and that there were incentives to being
dishonest.

“It’s important, during the course of this pandemic, to be honest, stay
at home and to wear a mask, to do social distancing,” he said. “But I
also think there are a lot of subtle pressures that push people to not
be totally truthful.”

When people do lie, he said, they sometimes give themselves excuses that
it’s OK because they’re just trying to cope with the pandemic.

Dr. Castro said people might be more inclined to lie about their health
because it’s such a personal matter.

People ask for honesty about their health “to protect others, and that
becomes very difficult because there is a moral element of that,” he
said.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

When people lie, Professor Feldman said, they make a risk-reward
calculation: “If you’ve been in lockdown for months, you begin to feel
like you deserve to be free,” he said.

“Because you tell yourself, ‘I’ve suffered, I’m still suffering — who
knows when life is going to get back to normal?’” he said. “The fact
that we’ve been through a period, and are still in it, of such
uncertainty and lacking in clarity of when it’s going to end, it sort of
gives us permission to be less honest.”
