\section{Are You Lying More in the Pandemic? Some Certainly
Are}\label{are-you-lying-more-in-the-pandemic-some-certainly-are}}

The rate at which people are lying during the pandemic has increased,
experts suggest, perhaps because health-related matters are particularly
difficult to share.

As much of the United States moves toward reopening in phases, some
people are enjoying little bites of pre-pandemic life, such as dining in
restaurants, exercising in gyms and learning in classrooms. With the
gradual return comes a set of intrusive health questions: Are you
experiencing any symptoms? Have you been exposed to anyone who has
tested positive for the coronavirus? Answering those questions is where
it gets tricky.

People usually tell one to two lies a day,
\href{https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.597.8906\&rep=rep1\&type=pdf}{according
to a 1996 university study}. Consistent with the belief that lying is an
everyday social interaction, participants said they did not view their
lies as serious and did not worry about being caught, the researchers
said.

But what about lying during a pandemic that has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/upshot/virus-lasting-economic-effects.html}{brought
widespread economic damage} and produced a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/12/us/covid-deaths-us.html}{national
health crisis}?

Incidents in which people were dishonest about their health have been
well documented over the last several months. In March,
\href{https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2020/03/31/rochester-ny-hospitals-tighten-visitor-policy-dad-hides-covid-19-symptoms-strong-highland/5085892002/}{a
New York man lied about his Covid-19 symptoms} to gain access to a
maternity ward to see his wife, who later developed flulike symptoms.
The same month, a woman who flew from Massachusetts to Los Angeles and
then to Beijing
\href{https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-18/woman-who-flew-from-u-s-to-china-for-coronavirus-test-faces-criminal-charges}{was
placed under investigation} after she was accused of lying about her
symptoms. In August, a woman in Washington State was shamed for lying to
her manicurist about
\href{https://www.allure.com/story/nail-client-exposes-manicurist-to-covid-19-virus-washington}{testing
positive for the virus}.

A recent Brock University study of 451 adults ages 20 to 82 living in
the United States found that people who believed they had contracted the
virus weren't always honest. Thirty-four percent of Covid-19-positive
participants said they had denied having symptoms when asked by others,
and 55 percent reported some level of concealment of their symptoms.

Twenty-five percent of participants reported that they had in some way
concealed their physical distancing practices; that rate increased among
those with Covid-19, according to the study,
\href{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105320951603}{published
last month in The Journal of Health Psychology}. Women were more likely
to disclose health symptoms than men were, researchers said, and older
adults were more honest about their Covid-19 status and behaviors.

But the exact reasoning behind lying during the pandemic is complicated
and may be related to the environment, according to David M. Castro, a
psychotherapist and adjunct professor of psychology at Adelphi
University and the City College of New York.

``I think that so much is barred from someone right now,'' Dr. Castro
said. ``There's a lot of loneliness, a lot of depression stemming from
loneliness.'' The fact that the current social environment may not
provide people what they need could tempt people to act in ways that get
them what they need, he added.

Robert Feldman, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst and the author of
``\href{https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/robert-feldman/the-liar-in-your-life/9780446552196/}{The
Liar in Your Life: The Way to Truthful Relationships},'' said that his
research showed that people typically tell three lies within the first
10 minutes of meeting someone else.

``It's part of what we do as members of society,'' Professor Feldman
said. ``We tell people that we're feeling well when we're not feeling so
well.''

Another common example of lying, he said, is saying that you liked a
gift you didn't like.

``Society operates on lies in many ways,'' Professor Feldman said.
``Most of these lies are probably fairly trivial in the grand scheme of
things, but they are lies.''

Professor Feldman said that he believed the number of lies people tell
had gone up during the pandemic and that there were incentives to being
dishonest.

``It's important, during the course of this pandemic, to be honest, stay
at home and to wear a mask, to do social distancing,'' he said. ``But I
also think there are a lot of subtle pressures that push people to not
be totally truthful.''

When people do lie, he said, they sometimes give themselves excuses that
it's OK because they're just trying to cope with the pandemic.

Dr. Castro said people might be more inclined to lie about their health
because it's such a personal matter.

People ask for honesty about their health ``to protect others, and that
becomes very difficult because there is a moral element of that,'' he
said.

When people lie, Professor Feldman said, they make a risk-reward
calculation: ``If you've been in lockdown for months, you begin to feel
like you deserve to be free,'' he said.

``Because you tell yourself, `I've suffered, I'm still suffering --- who
knows when life is going to get back to normal?''' he said. ``The fact
that we've been through a period, and are still in it, of such
uncertainty and lacking in clarity of when it's going to end, it sort of
gives us permission to be less honest.''
