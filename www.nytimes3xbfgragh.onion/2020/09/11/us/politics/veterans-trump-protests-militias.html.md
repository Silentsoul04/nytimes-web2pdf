# Veterans Fortify the Ranks of Militias Aligned With Trump’s Views

The vast majority of veterans do not join militias, but some
fast-growing militias have many veterans among their ranks.

WASHINGTON — Emboldened by President Trump’s campaign platform of law
and order, militia groups have bolstered their strength before Election
Day by attracting military veterans who bring weapons and tactical
skills viewed as important to the organizations.

The role of veterans in the newly proliferating militia groups — which
sometimes are steeped in racism and other times steeped simply in
antigovernment zealotry — has increased over the last decade, said a
dozen experts on law enforcement, domestic terrorism and extremist
groups.

Although only a small fraction of the nation’s 20 million veterans joins
militia groups, experts in domestic terrorism and law enforcement
analysts estimate that veterans and active-duty members of the military
may now make up at least 25 percent of militia rosters. These experts
estimate that there are some 15,000 to 20,000 active militia members in
around 300 groups.

But gauging the size of these groups is difficult and imprecise, because
much of their membership is limited to online participation. The
estimates are based on samplings of militia member data gleaned from
social media profiles, blogs, online forums, militia publications,
interviews, assessments from watchdog groups and news reports.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At least four recently formed violent organizations were founded by
military veterans, and many high-profile episodes stemming from militia
groups — [the killing of a federal security officer in
May](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/us/steven-carrillo-air-force-boogaloo.html)
in Oakland, Calif., [a thwarted
plan](https://apnews.com/6223153093f08fa910c4ab445771b773) to incite
violence at a recent demonstration in Las Vegas and [the violence during
a 2017
protest](https://www.propublica.org/article/atomwaffen-division-hate-group-active-duty-military)
in Charlottesville, Va. — involved veterans.

Underscoring how the threat of violent domestic groups is rising with
limited official oversight, the top leaders of the Department of
Homeland Security directed agency analysts to play down threats from
white supremacist groups, according to [a whistle-blower
complaint](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenttools/homeland-security-whistleblower/0819ec9ee29306a5/full.pdf)
released on Wednesday.

While militias and other paramilitary groups have been historically
hostile toward the federal government regardless of the party in power,
many have turned their animus in recent months toward Black Lives Matter
activists as well as local leaders who enforced restrictions to combat
the coronavirus. A notable example was in Michigan, where [protesters,
some armed, stormed the
statehouse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/far-right-coronavirus-protests-restrictions)
this spring in opposition to pandemic rules. Some have begun adopting
the language Mr. Trump uses to preemptively cast doubt on the outcome of
an election.

Militias have historically risen after periods of war, said Kathleen
Belew, an assistant professor of history at the University of Chicago
and author of “Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and
Paramilitary America.”

“We have seen veterans and active-duty members being recruited because
they have operational skills that are useful,” Ms. Belew said. She
described the estimates of how many veterans had been drawn to the
movement as “deeply concerning.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It is an issue that federal agencies have largely avoided. “The V.A. has
no authority to enact or enforce policies regarding veterans’
memberships in any organizations,” said Christina Noel, a spokeswoman
for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

One of the larger groups, [the Oath
Keepers](https://www.adl.org/resources/profiles/the-oath-keepers), makes
recruiting veterans and law enforcement officers central to its mission.

“As a country we have spent so long at war overseas that a small
percentage of veterans, but a percentage nonetheless, has warmed them to
the idea that the way to deal with political conflict is to engage in
armed struggle,” said Devin Burghart, the executive director of the
Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, a Seattle-based
research center on far-right groups. “This is a dangerous indicator of
where things may go.”

From the years after the Vietnam War to the mid-1990s, a small flurry of
militia groups cropped up around the United States.

[Frazier Glenn
Miller](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/frazier-glenn-miller),
a former Army master sergeant who served two tours in Vietnam, created
the White Patriot Party in the 1980s. Decades later, he was sentenced to
death for killing three people outside a Jewish community center in
Overland Park, Kan. In 1995, [Timothy J.
McVeigh](https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/timothy-mcveigh), a
former Army soldier who belonged to a right-wing survivalist group based
in Michigan, blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168
people, including 19 children. Mr. McVeigh promoted the works of
[William
Pierce](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2002/07/24/us/william-pierce-69-neo-nazi-leader-dies.html),
who ran a white supremacist group that [once posted a recruiting
notice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1995/12/21/us/for-most-gi-s-only-few-hints-of-hate-groups.html)
on a billboard outside Fort Bragg, N.C.

But beginning in 2009, antagonism toward the presidency of Barack Obama,
combined with a new crop of post-Sept. 11 veterans, fueled exponential
growth in militia groups.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

While the military strictly forbids its active-duty personnel from
participating in hate groups, it is silent on militias and the role of
veterans who have left service.

“Veterans are often looked at for their paramilitary skills, their
ability to survive in the field as well as leadership skills,” said
Daryl Johnson, a former senior terrorism analyst at the Department of
Homeland Security. “They are proficient with weapons, which they often
own.”

While many veterans who are deployed overseas return filled with
gratitude to be back in the United States, others return with very
different views, informed by their work in countries whose political
systems they despise and fearful that such ideologies could infiltrate
their own country.

“You see overseas how things can go wrong,” Mr. Johnson said. Fear of
communism, Islamic law and Marxism permeate some veterans’ thinking.
“They take experiences they have had overseas and transport them to
the homeland and think there are all these threats,” he said.

In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security released an [intelligence
assessment](https://fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf) warning that
returning veterans who faced trouble reintegrating could “lead to the
potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable
of carrying out violent attacks.”

The report led to such an outcry from conservatives and one prominent
veterans organization that the department [deep-sixed
it](https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2009/04/16/extremist-report-draws-criticism-prompts-apology/).
“We used the term ‘disgruntled’ so that terminology was insensitive,”
said Mr. Johnson, who helped prepare the report. “We were trying to show
they were susceptible to recruitment because of skills they learned.
That is a glaring truth no matter who is offended.”

That same year, the F.B.I. did its [own
investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123992665198727459) of
extremist groups with a focus on veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The Obama years were a growth period for these groups, many of them
loosely tied to the Tea Party movement. Most notable was the Oath
Keepers, formed in 2009 with a core notion that its members should
continue to honor the oaths they took in the military and law
enforcement agencies to defend the country, via their efforts in a
militia.

Stewart Rhodes, a former Army paratrooper who served as a staff member
for Ron Paul, then a Republican representative of Texas, “formed the
group to encourage current and former military and law enforcement
members to honor their oath against tyranny,” said Sam Jackson, an
assistant professor at the University at Albany who has written a book
on the group. “But the focus of threats has changed to be antifa and
Black Lives Matter and others on the
left.”

The movement has accelerated during Mr. Trump’s time in office. In 2015,
Brandon Russell, a member of the Florida Army National Guard, formed the
Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi group. One of its members, [Vasillios
Pistolis](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2019/09/04/the-neo-nazi-boot-inside-one-marines-descent-into-extremism/),
a private at the time, participated in the “Unite the Right” rally in
Charlottesville, bragging on social media about injuring people. (He was
[later kicked
out](https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2019/09/04/the-neo-nazi-boot-inside-one-marines-descent-into-extremism/)
of the Marines.)

After that rally in 2017, Joffre Cross III, a former private in the 82nd
Airborne Division at Fort Bragg and a member of the newly formed Patriot
Front, was charged with multiple weapons felonies.

[The “boogaloo”
movement](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/american-boogaloo-meme-or-terrorist-movement/613843/),
a loose network of right-leaning, antigovernment groups that seeks to
bring about a second civil war to overthrow the government, has been
around since 2012, when it was largely an online movement.

In June, Daniel Austin Dunn, a former Marine, [was indicted in
Texas](https://int.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/data/documenttools/dunn-indictment/a97279ae6811af57/full.pdf)
for making violent threats toward police officers on Facebook and
Twitter posts, in which he associated himself with boogaloos. The
authorities found a cache of weapons at his house. This year, [the
F.B.I. arrested an Army reservist and two
veterans](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/06/04/army-reservist-navy-and-air-force-vets-plotted-to-terrorize-vegas-protests-prosecutors-charge/)
with ties to the movement for planning to incite violence at a Las Vegas
protest. An [active-duty
airman](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2020/06/16/air-force-sergeant-charged-in-killing-of-federal-officer-in-california/)
affiliated with the group was also charged with killing a federal
officer in Oakland.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A small number of veterans have joined ranks with left-leaning groups or
groups not associated with the political right. A sniper who shot a
dozen Dallas police officers in 2016, [killing
five,](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/dallas-police-ambush/dallas-shooter-micah-xavier-johnson-was-army-veteran-n606101)
was an Army veteran.

The man law enforcement officials believe shot and killed a right-wing
activist in Portland, Ore., last month was an antifa supporter and a
veteran; he was killed[last
week](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/us/michael-reinoehl-arrest-portland-shooting.html)by
the police. But veterans with far-left views are small in number and
tend to act outside any organized force — the antifa movement, for
example, lacks the structure and leadership of a militia — according to
experts in the field.

Many groups have proclaimed themselves as enforcers of Trump
administration policies, and more recently, as protectors of businesses
in cities with protests, often antagonizing those protesters. The
confrontations with protesters have also dovetailed with actions to
protest [coronavirus containment
measures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/03/us/coronavirus-extremists.html),
often with a side of conspiracy theories to generate new member
interest.

A well-known group, the [Three
Percenters](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/three-percenters),
focuses on anti-immigrant activities and targets leftists like members
of antifa. A leader of a chapter in Georgia, [Chris
Hill](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/05/us/a-militia-gets-battle-ready-for-a-gun-grabbing-clinton-presidency.html),
is a Marine veteran who leads regular field training exercises.

The United Constitutional Patriots, a militia that patrols the
southwestern border with Mexican, [has also attracted
veterans](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/23/us/new-mexico-militia-border.html).

“The militia movement traditionally hated the federal government,” said
Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and
Extremism. “This has completely changed with Trump.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

As they have inserted themselves in cities with large protests, the
groups have found themselves sometimes welcomed by local law
enforcement. “We have militia groups that are inserting themselves into
cities to, from their perspective, to fill a vacuum of law enforcement,”
said Seth G. Jones, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. “But they are doing things outside of the law to
take law and order into their own hands.”

Mike Martinez, the police chief of Arroyo Grande, Calif., said the
militias were a concern. “Many militias have their own ideology,” he
said. “Some are not pro-law enforcement, so it is always important for
us to be aware.”

The end of the Trump era would not spell the end to militias, the
experts agreed. “In the immediate aftermath of an election, I don’t see
this ebbing,” Mr. Jones said. “In fact my concern is there will be a
range of organizations that don’t support the legitimacy of a Biden
president and that administration will have to think about how to disarm
militias. That will be a dangerous situation.”
