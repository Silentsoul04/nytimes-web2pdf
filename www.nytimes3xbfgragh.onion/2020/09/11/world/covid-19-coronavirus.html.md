# Fauci Warns Coronavirus Could Disrupt Life Well Into New Year

</div>

China has been using its prospects for developing a vaccine as a
diplomatic carrot. The pandemic has exacerbated the worldwide threat of
hunger and malnutrition.

## Fauci cautions the virus could disrupt life in the U.S. until ‘maybe even towards the end of 2021.’

The United States should not expect a return to normal until “well into
2021, maybe even towards the end of 2021,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the
nation’s top infectious diseases expert, said on Friday.

In [an interview with “Andrea Mitchell
Reports”](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fauci-says-us-won-t-get-back-normal-until-late-n1239882)
on MSNBC, Dr. Fauci addressed when people would most likely be able to
do things again that they had done before the pandemic, such as going to
an indoor movie theater “with impunity.” While a vaccine may be
available by the end of the year, he said, “by the time you mobilize the
distribution of the vaccinations, and you get the majority or more of
the population vaccinated and protected, that’s likely not going to
happen till the mid or end of 2021.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Fauci was also asked about comments he had made on [Thursday in a
panel discussion at Harvard Medical
School](https://partners.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/968f633a874c4f1a80c368496f49d4661d),
where he said “we need to hunker down and get through this fall and
winter because it’s not going to be easy.” Ms. Mitchell pointed out that
this conflicted with what President Trump had said at the White House on
the same day, that the country had “[rounded the final
turn”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-091020/)
on the virus.

“I have to disagree,” Dr. Fauci said of Mr. Trump’s optimistic read on
the situation.

“We’re plateauing at around 40,000 cases a day and the deaths are around
1,000.” He raised concerns that Labor Day could make that number rise
again, as Memorial Day and the Fourth of July had done before.

But in any case, he said “what we don’t want to see is going into the
fall season when people will be spending more time indoors — and that’s
not good for a respiratory borne virus — you don’t want to start off
already with a baseline that’s so high.”

As of Thursday, there had been an average of 35,629 cases per day over
the previous week, a decrease of 16 percent from the average two weeks
earlier, [according to a Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
Case numbers remain persistently high across much of the country, though
reports of new cases have dropped considerably since late July, when the
country averaged well over 60,000 per day.

But even as many of the country’s most populous states saw vast
improvement — and as the Northeast kept case reports low — new
infections were rising by late summer across parts of the Midwest and
South.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Deaths, though still well below their peak levels in the spring,
averaged around 700 per day in mid-September, more than were reported in
early
July.

China is still most likely months away from mass producing a vaccine
that is safe for public use. But the country is using the prospect of
the drug’s discovery in [a charm offensive aimed at repairing damaged
ties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/business/china-vaccine-diplomacy.html)
and bringing friends closer in regions China deems vital to its
interests.

Latin American and Caribbean nations will receive loans to buy the
medicine, and Bangladesh will get over 100,000 free doses from a Chinese
company.

In the Philippines, where China is competing with the United States for
influence, President Rodrigo Duterte [told
lawmakers](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3094918/duterte-seeks-chinese-coronavirus-vaccine-rules-out-us-bases)
in July that he had “made a plea” to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, for
help with vaccines. He also said he would not confront China over its
claims to the South China Sea.

A day later, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, said
China was willing to give the Philippines priority access to a vaccine.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

China’s vaccine pledges, on top of earlier shipments of masks and
ventilators around the world, help it project itself as a responsible
player and could also help it push back against accusations that the
ruling Communist Party should be held accountable for its [initial
missteps](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/world/asia/china-coronavirus-beijing-trump.html)
when the coronavirus first emerged in China in December.

The Trump administration has roundly attacked Beijing over its handling
of the virus crisis, as well as over accusations that Chinese-directed
hackers [have tried to steal vaccine research to gain an
edge.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/us/politics/china-hacking-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
The Justice Department indicted two Chinese suspects accused of
targeting pharmaceutical companies in July.

China is a leader in the global race for a Covid-19 vaccine, and four
out of the eight [late phase clinical
trials](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
are for Chinese vaccines. The country began testing experimental
vaccines on soldiers and employees of state-owned companies in July, and
the testing has quietly expanded to include health care and aviation
workers. Chinese vaccine makers have built factories that can produce
hundreds of thousands of doses.

The United States has three vaccine candidates in late-stage trials,
with Pfizer saying it could apply for emergency approval as early as
October and Moderna saying it hopes to have a vaccine by the end of the
year.
[AstraZeneca](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/health/coronavirus-astrazeneca-vaccine-safety.html),
a British-Swedish company that received U.S. government funding to
develop its vaccine, paused its late-stage global trials this week
because of a serious suspected adverse reaction in a participant.

But Chinese vaccine companies that have gone abroad to conduct clinical
trials have also [generated
controversy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/16/business/china-vaccine-coronavirus.html)
amid fears that local residents are being treated like guinea pigs. And
some political experts worry about the leverage that China could wield
over countries that accept vaccines.

“Should we be suspicious, or should we be grateful?” asked Muhammad
Zulfikar Rakhmat, an academic at Universitas Islam Indonesia, who
researches China’s foreign policy in Indonesia.

Long before the coronavirus swept into her village in the rugged
southeast of Afghanistan, Halima Bibi knew the gnawing fear of hunger.
It was a relentless source of anxiety as she struggled to nourish her
four children.

Her husband earned about $5 a day, hauling produce by wheelbarrow from a
local market to surrounding homes. Most days, he brought home a loaf of
bread, potatoes and beans for an evening meal.

But when the virus arrived in March, taking the lives of her neighbors
and shutting down the market, her husband’s earnings plunged to about $1
a day. Most evenings, he brought home only bread. Some nights, he
returned with nothing.

“We hear our children screaming in hunger, but there is nothing that we
can do,” said Ms. Bibi, speaking by telephone from a hospital in Kabul,
where her 6-year-old daughter was being treated for severe malnutrition.
“That is not just our situation, but the reality for most of the
families where we live.”

As the global economy absorbs the most punishing reversal of fortunes
since the Great Depression, [hunger is on the
rise](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/business/covid-hunger-food-insecurity.html).
Those confronting potentially life-threatening levels of so-called food
insecurity in the developing world are expected to nearly double this
year to 265 million, according to the [United Nations World Food
Program](https://www.wfp.org/news/covid-19-will-double-number-people-facing-food-crises-unless-swift-action-taken).

The largest numbers of vulnerable communities are concentrated in South
Asia and Africa, especially in countries that are already confronting
trouble, including military conflict, extreme poverty and
climate-related afflictions like drought, flooding and soil
erosion.

As countries around the world [struggle to safely reopen
schools](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/world/schools-reopen-globe-students.html)
this fall, China’s Communist Party is harnessing the power of its
authoritarian system to offer in-person learning for about 195 million
students in kindergarten through 12th grade at public schools.

It has mobilized battalions of local officials and party cadres to
inspect classrooms, deployed apps and other technology to monitor
students and staff, and restricted their movements. It has even told
parents to stay away for fear of spreading germs.

China’s leader, [Xi Jinping, said in a
speech](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html#link-adc17f7)
on Tuesday that the country’s progress in fighting the virus, including
the opening of schools, had “fully demonstrated the clear superiority of
Communist Party leadership and our socialist system.”

In many ways, China is applying the same heavy-handed model to reopen
schools that it has used to [bring the virus under
control](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/07/world/asia/china-coronavirus-cost.html).
To stop the epidemic, the authorities imposed [harsh
lockdowns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/06/world/asia/coronavirus-china-wuhan-quarantine.html)
and deployed [invasive technologies to track
residents](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/technology/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html),
raising public anger in some places and concerns about the erosion of
privacy and civil liberties.

With schools, the government’s effort has in some places been met with
similar frustrations. Teachers, who are at times doubling as medical
workers, checking for fevers and isolating sick students, say they are
exhausted by the new protocols. Students have complained that some
policies, such as lockdowns on university campuses, are excessive.

“The Chinese system moves by itself,” said Yong Zhao, a scholar at the
University of Kansas who has studied education in China. “The system is
run like a military: it just goes for it, no matter what anyone
thinks.”

A[new
study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a5.htm?s_cid=mm6936a5_x)
suggests that restaurant dining may have increased the risk of exposure
to the virus for some patrons, but several researchers said that the
links between contracting the virus and eating out should be viewed with
caution, because the study did not distinguish between patrons who dined
at indoor or outdoor facilities, and didn’t rely on contact tracing.

The study, released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
analyzed 314 patients and found that those who tested positive for the
virus were twice as likely to have eaten at a restaurant in the previous
two weeks as those who tested negative.

“We want people to understand as society opens back up where the risks
are for Covid-19,” said Dr. Wesley Self, a doctor and researcher at
Vanderbilt University and an author of the study.

Dr. Self said he believed in retrospect that the researchers should have
made the distinction between indoor and outdoor dining.

[Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Wednesday that New York City would
lift its
prohibition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/nyregion/indoor-dining-coronavirus.html)
on indoor dining on Sept. 30, allowing restaurants to operate at
one-quarter indoor capacity. In July, the governor and Mayor Bill de
Blasio halted a plan to resume indoor dining, citing concerns about a
resurgence of the virus. (The conditions of outdoor dining are
considered less risky.)

[Last
month](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/health/Covid-restaurants-bars.html),
data from a number of states and cities showed that community outbreaks
had centered on restaurants and bars. Contact tracers in Maryland found
that 12 percent of new cases in July were traced to restaurants, and in
Colorado, 9 percent of outbreaks were traced to bars and restaurants.
The patients in the new study were treated at 11 hospitals in
California, Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North
Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah and Washington.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Some researchers have urged caution in interpreting the findings of the
new C.D.C. study.

“The way folks have interpreted this study is that going to a restaurant
causes Covid,” said Zack Cooper, an associate professor of public health
at the Yale School of Public Health. “That isn’t what this type of study
is designed to show. What this shows is people who have Covid were more
likely to have been in restaurants.”

Dr. Cooper said dining in restaurants was probably associated with
increased risk because it puts people in proximity with others who are
not exercising caution in limiting their exposure to the virus. He said
researchers needed to be careful in studying the risks of common
activities, given the challenges for the general public in interpreting
statistical findings.

In an interview with CNN on Friday, Dr. Fauci was asked what the study’s
findings meant for people who wanted to dine out. He said that he would
not completely rule out going to a restaurant.

“But,” he said, “restaurant owners should be aware that, particularly if
you’re in a zone where you have a significant degree of infection, you
either do outdoor dining or if it’s indoor, you don’t do it at 100
percent
capacity.”

There have been at least 135,600 confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada
as of Friday evening, [according to the
government](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/canada/canada-coronavirus-cases.html).
The number of new cases being reported daily has fallen significantly

Four Canadian provinces — Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec
— account for more than 4,000 of the 4,439 cases that the country has
reported over the past week. Those provinces also accounted for all of
the 23 deaths related to Covid-19 that were reported over the same
period. This week, Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, said that
it will take a four-week “pause” before it considers loosening
restrictions or allowing further economic reopening.

Over all, at least 9,163 deaths in the country have been linked to
Covid-19. Quebec accounts for more than half of them, with 5,774,
followed by Ontario, with 2,813.

Canada has previously reported zero Covid-19 deaths in 24-hour periods,

It began as a trickle of coronavirus infections as college students
arrived for the fall semester. Soon that trickle became a stream, with
campuses reporting dozens, and sometimes hundreds of new cases each day.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Now the stream feels like a flood. In just the past week, a New York
Times survey has found, American colleges have recorded more than 36,000
additional infections, bringing the total of 88,000 cases since the
pandemic began.

Not all those cases are new, and the increase is partly the result of
more schools beginning to report the results of more testing. But The
Times survey of 1,600 colleges also shows how widely the contagion has
spread, with schools of every type and size, and in every state
reporting
infections.

## Tracking Covid at U.S. Colleges and Universities

Large outbreaks expanded on campuses as new semesters were underway.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Only about 60 of the campus cases have resulted in death — mostly of
college staff members — and only a small number have resulted in
hospitalizations. But public health experts say the rising number also
underscores an emerging reality: Colleges and universities have, as a
category, become hot spots for virus transmission, much as hospitals,
nursing homes and meat packing plants were earlier.

Hoping to salvage some sense of normalcy — along with lost revenue from
housing fees and out-of-state tuition — many schools invested heavily in
health measures to bring at least some students back to campus.

But outbreaks have forced course correction after correction.

The State University of New York at Oneonta sent students home after the
virus spun out of control in less than two weeks, with more than 500
cases. And the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign mounted one of
the most comprehensive safety plans, requiring more than 40,000 students
to be tested for the virus twice a week, and barring them from campus
buildings without app verification that the latest test was negative.
But, some students continued partying after they received a positive
test result, and hundreds were infected.

A lockdown brought the number of new cases at the university down again.
But its surge pushed its metro regions toward the top of the list of
[U.S. areas with most cases per
capita](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/23/upshot/five-ways-to-monitor-coronavirus-outbreak-us.html),

Officials in Oregon’s state corrections system this week [began moving
hundreds of inmates out of the path of the
wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/us/wildfires-live-updates.html)
creeping toward some of their prisons. But the introduction of large
groups of prisoners into different facilities may be exposing them to
another risk — contracting the virus.

Juan Chavez, a lawyer with the Oregon Justice Resource Center, a
nonprofit legal advocacy group, said that relocated inmates were
sleeping on mattresses crammed close together, but it’s “picking your
poison” between the virus and the fires. He added that he fears the
relocated inmates could contribute to a superspreader event for the
virus in the prisons.

But few other options exist for the Oregon Department of Corrections,
which has evacuated four prisons so far.

Inmates will be “housed with others from their home institution whenever
possible,” and officials are aware of the potential virus spread, said
Jennifer Black, a spokeswoman for the prison system.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

France is facing a worrying surge in cases, the government said on
Friday, warning that the new cases were rapidly increasing and that
hospitals were seeing an uptick in admissions.

Many expected new restrictions, especially after the government’s
scientific council said earlier this week that the authorities would
have to take “difficult measures.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But the authorities did not announce new rules, vowing instead to
improve the country’s immense testing program — which has been plagued
by delays in recent weeks — and urging the French to continue social
distancing measures.

The country registered about 54,000 new cases over the past 7 days —
[less than
Spain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/world/europe/coronavirus-covid-spain-second-wave.html?searchResultPosition=1),
but far more than other neighboring countries like
[Italy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/world/europe/coronavirus-sardinia-italy.html)
or Germany. Nearly 31,000 people in France have died of the virus.

On Thursday, there were nearly 10,000 new confirmed cases, a record
since the beginning of the epidemic. The surge is due partly to
widespread testing, but the positivity rate for those tests has also
increased — it was at 5.4 percent this week, up from 1.5 in late July —
meaning that the virus is picking up speed.

Jean Castex, the French prime minister, said in a televised address on
Friday that authorities were particularly worried about a renewed
increase in the number of hospitalizations, especially of elderly
people.

“This shows there is no Maginot line,” said Mr. Castex, referring to
national fortifications built in the 1930s. Even if the virus is still
mostly spreading among younger people, he said, it “inevitably” ends up
reaching more vulnerable segments of the population.

In other developments around the world:

  - **Myanmar** has locked down half of its largest city, Yangon, and
    halted travel between regions in an effort to halt the spread of the
    virus. Myanmar’s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, urged the public to
    follow health protocols in a nationally televised address on
    Thursday. The number of confirmed cases has gone up fivefold in less
    than three weeks, reaching 2,422 on Friday, with 14 deaths,
    according to [a Times
    database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html).

  - **India** again broke a record for daily new cases, reporting 97,750
    on Saturday, [according to a Times
    database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html).
    The previous record, set Friday, was 96,551.

  - **North Korea** has deployed crack troops along its border with a
    shoot-to-kill order to prevent smugglers from introducing the
    coronavirus into its isolated and malnourished population, the
    United States’ top general in South Korea, Gen. Robert B. Abrams,
    said on Thursday. North Korea insists that it has not confirmed a
    single case of Covid-19. But outside experts are skeptical, citing
    the country’s decrepit public health capabilities and the long
    border it shares with China, where the epidemic first
erupted.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

A series of studies released on Friday offered the strongest evidence
yet that the coronavirus is surging again in Britain, suggesting that
the country may be following other European nations in seeing
significant new spikes of the virus.

Scientists from Imperial College London said that the [prevalence of
coronavirus infections doubled every eight
days](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/institute-of-global-health-innovation/public/Resurgence-of-SARS-CoV-2-in-England--detection-by-community-antigen-surveillance.pdf)
from late August to early September in England, a significant quickening
of the spread.

The scientists tested a random sample of 150,000 people and estimated
that the so-called reproduction number — a measure of how many people on
average a single patient will infect — was 1.7, indicating a growing
outbreak. An R number below 1 would indicate a dwindling outbreak.

The government’s own scientific advisory group [offered a more
conservative
estimate](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-r-number-in-the-uk) of the
virus’s spread — it said the R number was between 1 and 1.2 in Britain —
but still said that “the epidemic is growing.”

The British government reported 3,539 new daily cases on Friday, lifting
its seven-day average well over 2,500, a level last seen in May. Its
total caseload has surpassed 361,000, with more than 41,600 deaths.

Heeding the surge, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced this week that
the [government would ban gatherings of more than six
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/world/europe/boris-johnson-brexit-coronavirus.html).
But with students now returning to school and Britons socializing inside
more as the weather cools, scientists said that might not be enough.

“This is a massive blow to the government’s strategy to contain the
spread of Covid-19,” Simon Clarke, an associate professor at the
University of Reading, said of the Imperial College London study.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Mr. Johnson has been encouraging people to go back to work, eat out at
restaurants, patronize pubs and send children back to school. Many
Britons have also [remained resistant to wearing face
masks](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-masks-mandate.html)
in crowded places.

Britain’s new contact-tracing app will be introduced in England and
Wales on Sept. 24, Mr. Johnson’s government announced on Friday. The
government had previously been criticized over the long delay; [earlier
versions were scrapped months
ago](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/world/europe/uk-contact-tracing-coronavirus.html).

Halsey Beshears, Florida’s secretary for the Department of Business and
Professional Regulation, announced [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/HalseyBeshears/status/1304194720856408064?s=20)
on Thursday that the state would allow bars to operate at half capacity
starting Monday. He rescinded an executive order from June that had
banned drinking at bars as the state experienced a surge.

Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, had hinted earlier on Thursday that his
administration would not only soon allow the reopening of bars and
restaurants but also forbid future closures.

“I think that we probably need to just have it that everyone knows
they’ll be able to operate,” he said. “The closures are just totally
off the table, because it’s hard to plan if you think you have the sword
of Damocles hanging over your head.”

On Friday, Mr. DeSantis announced that the state’s two biggest counties,
Miami-Dade and Broward, would move to the second phase of reopening on
Monday, paving the way for schools to bring students back into
classrooms sooner than expected.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The mayor of Miami-Dade County, Carlos Gimenez, and the county’s schools
superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, appeared with the governor at the news
conference on Friday. Mr. Carvalho said he expects to make an
announcement about physically opening schools before the end of the
month; he had previously established a timeline to bring students back
by Oct. 5.

About 51 percent of parents of public school students have told the
district they want to send their children back, he said, adding that
“six feet of distance is probably not going to be possible in many
schools.”

Mr. Gimenez, whose county was hit hardest in the state, said that his
administration would begin to look at businesses that could now reopen
under certain restrictions, including movie theaters and bowling alleys,
though he reiterated it would not include bars and nightclubs. On
Wednesday, he said he did not foresee reopening them “until we get a
vaccine.”

“We’re still not out of the woods yet, but we’re getting close,” he said
Friday.

In Puerto Rico, Gov. Wanda Vázquez eased some of the island’s tight
restrictions on Thursday, citing a recent drop in cases. Ms. Vázquez
lifted a lockdown that had forced people to stay home on Sundays, and
reopened beaches to everyone. She also authorized the reopening of gyms,
movie theaters and casinos at 25 percent capacity.

Bars and nightclubs remain closed, and a nightly curfew will remain in
effect.

crisis even as it found itself in the midst of
another](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/nyregion/9-11-ceremony-September-11th.html).

The somber rituals held at the Sept. 11 memorial in Lower Manhattan were
especially poignant in light of a pandemic that has crippled the country
and brought particularly devastating loss to New York City.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

The outbreak also altered a moment to honor the dead. Though the names
of the victims resounded across the plaza, and bells tolled across New
York as they have in years past, there was no stage in front of those
who came to mourn.

Some of America’s most notable politicians attended, including Vice
President Mike Pence and Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee for
president, but all of them wore masks in addition to their customary
memorial ribbons and lapel pins. They exchanged elbow bumps, then
distanced themselves six feet apart as they stood for the national
anthem.

It has been 19 years since passenger jets hijacked by terrorists slammed
into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and crashed into a field in
Shanksville, Pa. Nearly 3,000 lives were lost, some 2,700 of them in New

The pledge by career scientists in the federal government came amid
mounting concerns over the role the White House has played in emergency
approvals for coronavirus therapies, including convalescent plasma and
the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which the agency [later
revoked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html).

The specter of political arm-twisting has grown as several drugmakers
entered large late-stage vaccine trials this summer. President Trump
told reporters on Monday that “we’re going to have a vaccine very soon,
maybe even before a very special date.”

That timeline, framed around Election Day, has been [widely

by the administration’s top health officials, who have said that a

The statement in USA Today was written in large part because of fears
over political influence on the F.D.A., including from the White House,
according to senior administration officials familiar with the
effort.

Prospects for any additional stimulus to address the coronavirus
pandemic’s devastating toll before the election darkened considerably on
Thursday, when [a whittled-down Republican plan failed in the Senate on
a partisan
vote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/politics/second-stimulus-check.html).

Democrats voted unanimously to block the proposal from advancing,
calling it inadequate to meet the mounting needs for federal aid, in the
latest indication of a lack of political will to reach an agreement,
even as critical federal aid for individuals and businesses has run dry.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

It was a nearly party-line vote whose outcome was never in doubt. The
proposal amounted to a fraction of the $1 trillion plan Republicans had
offered in negotiations with Democrats, who in turn are demanding more
than twice as much.

A failure to compromise would leave millions of jobless Americans in
potentially dire straits, as they exhaust jobless benefits and states
run out of additional funds that Mr. Trump steered to the unemployed by
executive order last month. It would also strand a wide swath of small
business owners who have endured steep drops in revenue, with little
prospect of a return to normal levels for months to come.

“Along with a pandemic of Covid-19, we have a pandemic of politics,”
Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said. “Looking to the House —

podcast](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-plasma-reinfection.html)
to talk about the coronavirus.

[Mr. Leonhardt
writes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/briefing/california-wildfires-september-11-attacks-nfl-your-friday-briefing.html):

> Donald makes a fascinating point: Don’t look only at snapshots, like a

> The pandemic, he adds, is like a marathon with staggered start times.

> The virus began spreading widely in Europe earlier than in North
> America. Much of Europe failed to contain it at first and suffered
> terrible death tolls. The per capita toll in a few countries, like
> Britain, Italy and Spain, remains somewhat higher than in the U.S. But

When the pandemic hit, Americans vastly scaled back on preventive
health, and [there is little sign that this deferred care will be made
up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/upshot/pandemic-decline-preventive-care.html).

Vaccinations dropped by nearly 60 percent in April, and almost no one
was getting a colonoscopy, according to new data from the nonprofit
Health Care Cost Institute.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

The data, drawn from millions of health insurance claims, shows a
consistent pattern, whether it was prostate screenings or
contraceptives: Preventive care declined drastically this spring and, as
of late June, had not yet recovered to normal levels. Many types of such
care were still down by a third at the start of this summer, the most
recent data available shows, as Americans remained wary of visiting
hospitals and medical offices.

Americans continued seeking care they couldn’t avoid — hospital
admissions for childbirth, for example, held steady — but avoided care
they could put off. More invasive preventive procedures, such as
mammograms and colonoscopies, showed the greatest decline.

Colonoscopies, which are generally used to screen for colon cancer,
declined by 88 percent in mid-April and were still 33 percent lower than
normal at the end of June. Mammograms, which fell 77 percent at the
height of the pandemic, are still down 23 percent.

Critical childhood vaccinations for hepatitis, measles, whooping cough
and other diseases also declined significantly, a
[trend](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/health/coronavirus-measles-vaccines.html)
that had already begun to worry pediatricians earlier in the pandemic.
Of particular concern, measles vaccinations fell 73 percent in mid-April
and were still down 36 percent at the end of June.

But one preventive service stayed relatively steady through the
pandemic: pregnancy-related ultrasounds. Those declined slightly in
March and April but never fell more than 20 percent below 2019 levels.
Insertions of IUDs, one of the most effective birth control methods,
declined like other preventive care — raising the possibility of an
increase in pregnancies in coming months.
