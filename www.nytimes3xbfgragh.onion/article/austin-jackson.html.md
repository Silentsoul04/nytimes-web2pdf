\[[*Read our 2020 NFL mock draft picks from across the
web*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/nfl-mock-draft-predictions.html).\]

As a left tackle, Austin Jackson plays the role of protectorate — taking
care of a precious commodity, a quarterback’s blind side. It’s a role
for which the 20-year-old from the University of Southern California has
long been prepared.

For as long as he can remember, Jackson has looked after his sister
Autumn, who is two years younger and was born with [Diamond-Blackfan
anemia](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/diamond-blackfan-anemia), a
rare disorder that left her needing blood transfusions every three weeks
and made her increasingly susceptible to diseases like leukemia.

Last year, doctors suggested a lifeline: a bone-marrow transplant, which
was not without risk, but if successful could allow Autumn to live a
nearly normal life.

Her brother was found to be a match, so last July — less than a month
before the start of U.S.C.’s training camp — Jackson had more than a
liter of bone marrow withdrawn from three points in his lower back. The
next day, his sister, who had undergone chemotherapy to kill off her
bone marrow, received a transfusion.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“The first thing I did was thank God for giving Autumn this
opportunity,” said Jackson, who started in U.S.C.’s opener and was
chosen for the Pac-12 Conference’s first team despite not regaining his
full strength until October.

The change to his training regimen last year, when he had to lift
weights and run by himself in his hometown, Phoenix, so he would not
contract an infection, has left him well equipped to handle the way the
coronavirus pandemic has disrupted training schedules and draft plans.

Jackson was shopping for a new suit and perusing Las Vegas hotel suites
when the N.F.L. announced the [draft would be held
remotely](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/14/sports/football/nfl-draft-virtual.html).
As such, Jackson, 6-foot-5, 322 pounds and among the better prospects in
what draft analysts call a deep pool of left tackles, will gather with
his parents and a couple of friends from high school when the draft
begins on Thursday.

With his pro day workout at U.S.C. scuttled, his focus shifted away from
combine-like drills to getting ready for the season. His day starts with
yoga to loosen up his back, then he goes to his old high school to lift
weights and run on the field. He also hikes Squaw Peak and Lookout
Mountain, where the reward for the climb is an expansive view of the
Phoenix area.

Most of his preparation for the season is now done in solitude.

“You’re a lot more careful about touching things and being around
people,” Jackson said. “It’s a little different, but it’s for a good
cause.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

That cause includes Autumn, who is recovering well — “in a couple
months, she should be all clear,” Jackson said — but is
immunocompromised, which puts her at risk of serious illness. She is
staying with her mother and stepfather; Austin has his own apartment.

Jackson said he considers where they were a year ago, and how if his
sister were undergoing the transplant now she would be isolated from the
family. Instead, with plans to attend college, she is preparing to
embark on a new chapter in the fall — not unlike her brother.

“The timing,” he said, “was perfect.”
