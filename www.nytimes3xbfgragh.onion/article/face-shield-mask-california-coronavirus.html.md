**Last week, we introduced our ongoing series,** **[Your
Lead](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/series/your-lead), where we**
**[answer readers’
questions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/us/coronavirus-california-life.html)**
**about how the pandemic is changing daily life in**
**[California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html).**

**Today we are tackling our first question: Why have face shields not
yet caught on as an alternative to masks in California?**

Lori Holt, a neuropsychologist in Encino, posed this question. Dr. Holt
conducts in-office assessments on patients using plexiglass barriers,
air purifiers and disinfectants to protect herself and her patients from
[Covid-19](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html).
However, her efforts to conduct an accurate assessment are often stymied
by patients who come in wearing masks.

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“One of the thorniest issues we had to overcome involved the use of face
coverings,” she wrote in an email.

Dr. Holt evaluates patients using a battery of tests to gauge things
like a patient’s memory, attention and language. Face masks can
sometimes muffle speech, posing communication challenges and potentially
affecting the patient’s comprehension of the tests.

“If the patient doesn’t fully understand even a word or two of a
paragraph or a word list that I’m asking them to remember for a verbal
memory test, the entire test is ‘spoiled’ and unusable,” she
said.

Dr. Holt has found that clear plastic [face
shields](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/well/live/face-shields-masks-valves-vents.html)
are a good alternative to masks for her patients, who can opt to wear
their own masks or are given their own face shields that they can take
home afterward.

“It is much easier to test the patients when they wear the face shield,”
she said. “Their speech is much more intelligible than when they wear a
mask. Also, we can see the patient’s face and thus do not lose critical
data with respect to facial expression that can help us understand the
patient’s emotional state of mind.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Dr. Holt wondered about the popularity of face shields because, she
said, despite the shield casting a minor glare, it is so comfortable
that she sometimes forgets to take it off at the end of the day.

John Anderson, who lives in Penn Valley, Calif., asked a similar
question about face shields. Mr. Anderson is hearing-impaired and
prefers that others use face shields so that he can read lips. During a
recent health checkup, his doctor wore a mask and his wife wore a face
shield. He read his wife’s lips as she repeated the doctor’s words.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

</div>

Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all Californians [to wear face
coverings](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf),
like cloth masks, when out in public. The state’s Department of Public
Health recommends wearing a plastic face shield with a cloth draped
along the bottom only [if the wearer has a medical
condition](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf)
that prevents them from wearing a cloth mask.

Face shields are also commonly used by front-line health workers, but
more people are looking at face shields as an added layer of protection.

The Palo Alto Unified teachers’ union[requested that the district supply
teachers](https://paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/05/22/face-shields-and-testing-teachers-union-asks-for-protection-flexibility-in-working-conditions-this-fall)with
face shields and other personal protective equipment when they return to
school. And the state’s [Department of
Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/strongertogether.asp)
recommends that everyone on school campuses wear masks or face shields
with a drape across the bottom when schools reopen.

My colleague [Knvul
Sheikh](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/by/knvul-sheikh) wrote about
[the use of face
shields](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/24/health/coronavirus-face-shields.html),
which can be easily wiped down and reused. Face shields also have the
benefit of stopping people from touching their faces, and can be easier
and more comfortable than masks.

However, experts say face shields have limits to the amount of
protection they can offer. They seem to be most effective in protecting
against cough droplets for people [in close
range](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24467190/) of one another. And
droplets can seep in through the back and sides of a face shield, which
is why draping a piece of cloth along the bottom is recommended. But
their efficacy has not yet been widely studied. For now, face masks are
the better option for most people.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Regardless, we may be seeing a lot more of them in the coming weeks.

The City of Long Beach issued a [health
order](http://www.longbeach.gov/press-releases/city-to-provide-1000-free-face-shields-to-long-beach-restaurants/)
last month requiring servers in restaurants to wear both cloth masks and
face shields when working. Los Angeles issued a [similar
order](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/protocols/Reopening_Restaurants.pdf)
this month.

Because the face shields were cost prohibitive for some businesses, Long
Beach began a free distribution program for face shields that it sourced
from donations and from state and city resources. Last weekend, it
distributed 4,800 shields in just a few hours.

Sandy Wedgeworth, the city’s public health emergency management
director, estimates that the city still had around 25,000 face shields
that it planned to give away to restaurants, bars and salons in future
distribution events.

“We want them out there in the community. We want the folks that need
them to have them,” she said. “They are no good to anyone sitting in
boxes.”
