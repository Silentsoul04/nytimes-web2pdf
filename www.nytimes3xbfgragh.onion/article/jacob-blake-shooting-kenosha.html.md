including one in which the authorities said a teenager fatally shot two
demonstrators.

Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, was left partly paralyzed after a
[white police officer shot him seven times in the
back](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/23/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html)
outside an apartment complex in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 23.

The shooting, which happened in front of three of Mr. Blake’s children,
was captured by a neighbor in a video that circulated widely and rapidly
on social media. Outrage spread quickly, rekindling the nationwide
protests for racial justice that had followed the deaths of [George
Floyd](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/27/us/george-floyd-minneapolis-death.html),
[Elijah
McClain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/who-was-elijah-mcclain.html),
[Breonna
Taylor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/breonna-taylor-police.html)
and other Black Americans after encounters with the police.

[Protesters poured into
Kenosha](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html)
in the days after the shooting — as did counterprotesters. [An Illinois
teenager was charged with
homicide](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha.html)
in connection with the shooting deaths of two demonstrators.
Professional athletes in several leagues, led by the Milwaukee Bucks of
the N.B.A., joined the protests by refusing to play games.

Here’s what we know about Mr. Blake’s shooting and its aftermath.

## Who is Jacob Blake?

Mr. Blake, 29, a father of six, grew up in Evanston, Ill., and moved to
Kenosha a few years ago to find work and to raise his family, an uncle
told [The Chicago
Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/ct-evr-jacob-blake-kenosha-police-shooting-evanston-tl-0827-20200824-h63o7uquo5esnf7lnv23njzrx4-story.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“It was a safer location,” the uncle, Justin Blake, said. “He could work
and try to save and build a better life.”

Mr. Blake’s family said he was [working and training to become a
mechanic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/us/jacob-blake-shackles-assault.html)
at the time of the shooting.

His grandfather, also named Jacob Blake, was a pastor at an A.M.E.
church and a civil-rights leader in Evanston, The Tribune reported.

## Here’s what happened.

In July, a warrant was issued for Mr. Blake’s arrest on charges of
third-degree sexual assault, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct.
On Aug. 23, the woman who had filed the complaint that led to those
charges [called 911 to report that Mr. Blake was at her
home](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/us/jacob-blake-shackles-assault.html),
according to interviews and records.

State officials have said that [police officers responded to what they
described as a domestic
complaint](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/kenosha-shooting-protests-jacob-blake.html)
and tried to arrest Mr. Blake.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Before the police shot Mr. Blake, [officers twice tried to use a
Taser](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/us/jacob-blake-shackles-assault.html)
on him, state officials said. They also said that Mr. Blake had
[admitted that he had a
knife](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/kenosha-shooting-protests-jacob-blake.html),
which was later found on the driver’s side floorboard of Mr. Blake’s
car. There were no other weapons in the vehicle.

In a statement, the union representing Kenosha police officers suggested
that Mr. Blake had forcefully resisted arrest, fought with officers, put
one officer in a headlock and ignored orders to drop a knife he held in
his left hand.

Ben Crump, a lawyer for Mr. Blake’s family, denied that Mr. Blake had
been carrying a knife and said Mr. Blake had been trying to break up a
disturbance involving two women when the police arrived.

A neighbor recorded the shooting with a cellphone. The video shows Mr.
Blake being shot seven times in the back in front of his children as he
tried to get into his car.

Mr. Blake’s family has said he is paralyzed from the waist down. In a
[video posted on Twitter on
Sept. 5](https://twitter.com/GHOGM/status/1302314554278412288?s=20), Mr.
Blake said he had staples along his back and abdomen. “Every 24 hours,
it’s pain — it’s nothing but pain,” Mr. Blake said in the video. “It
hurts to breathe. It hurts to sleep. It hurts to move from side to side.
It hurts to eat.”

On Aug. 26, the Justice Department announced a civil rights
investigation into the shooting.

## Three officers were put on leave.

The police officer who shot Mr. Blake is [Rusten
Sheskey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/kenosha-police-officer-rusten-sheskey.html),
31, who has been with the Kenosha Police Department for seven years.

Officer Sheskey and two other officers were placed on [administrative
leave](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/us/jacob-blake-shackles-assault.html)
while the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation investigates the
shooting.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Protests spread widely.

Protests over Mr. Blake’s shooting played out in the streets of Kenosha,
in cities across the country and in the spotlight of professional
sports. Athletes from the N.B.A., the W.N.B.A., Major League Baseball
and Major League Soccer and at the Western & Southern Open tennis
tournament [refused to
play](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/sports/basketball/nba-boycott-bucks-magic-blake-shooting.html),
seizing on the shooting to take a stand against systemic racism and
police brutality.

In Kenosha, anger was palpable during [the first nights of the
protests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/jacob-blake-kenosha-fires.html),
as some demonstrators burned buildings and cars and threw fireworks,
water bottles and bricks at police officers in riot gear. Officers
responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets.

Protests spread across the country, to cities including Madison, Wis.;
Portland, Ore.; Minneapolis; and New York.

## Two people were shot dead.

In Kenosha on Aug. 25, two people were fatally shot, and a third was
wounded, as protesters clashed with counterprotesters, including a group
of armed men who said they were protecting the area from looters. The
two people killed were Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26. Mr.
Huber’s friends said he was protesting against the shooting of Mr.
Blake.

first-degree intentional homicide and attempted first-degree intentional
homicide, in connection with the shooting deaths of Mr. Rosenbaum and
Mr. Huber and the wounding of the third demonstrator.

Mr. Blake’s shooting and the protests that followed it were still fresh
when demonstrators [gathered at the Lincoln
Memorial](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/us/kenosha-shooting-protests.html#link-6676ec97)
on Aug. 28, the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Mr. Blake’s
father, Jacob Blake Sr., was among those who addressed the crowd.

“There are two systems of justice in the United States,” he said.
“There’s a white system, and there’s a Black system.” He added:
“We’re not taking it anymore.”

## The presidential candidates weighed in.

[President Trump visited Kenosha on
Sept. 1](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/us/trump-vs-biden),
touring buildings that had been damaged during the protests, meeting
with law enforcement officials and calling for a crackdown on violent
demonstrations. He did not meet with Mr. Blake’s family, and he
described police violence as the work of “bad apples.”

Visiting Kenosha two days later, [former Vice President Joseph R. Biden

showed sympathy toward protesters and Black voters. Mr. Biden met with
Mr. Blake’s family and their legal team for about an hour and spoke with
Mr. Blake by
phone.
