For the next week, most New York City residents will be required to be
at home, or at least out of public spaces, by 8 p.m. This nightly,
citywide curfew will be in place through the morning of June 8.

Under the [emergency executive order issued by Mayor Bill de Blasio on
Tuesday](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-119.pdf),
anyone not performing or traveling to or from essential work will be
required to be inside every night from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. This curfew
is three hours earlier than the [11 p.m.
deadline](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-117.pdf)
set on June 1 — and about 20 minutes before sunset.

Additionally, car travel in Manhattan will be banned below 96th Street
during curfew hours, except for local residents, essential workers,
buses and truck deliveries.

So does this mean you’re trapped inside, all night? Well, not exactly.

## Did you say the curfew is before sunset?

Yes\! The sun was due to set at 8:22 p.m. on June 2, the first night of
the extended-hours curfew — the second night of curfew over all — and is
due to set progressively one minute later each night.(The summer
solstice, the longest day of the year, is June 20.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## To whom, exactly, does the curfew apply?

In a nutshell: Unless you absolutely need to be outside for work or for
medical reasons, the curfew applies to
you.

The people exempt from the curfew are the ones you would expect: police
and peace officers, firefighters, emergency medical workers and
technicians, anyone seeking medical treatment or supplies, and anyone
performing or traveling to or from essential work, like food delivery,
transit and health care. Those who are homeless are also exempt.

**\[LIVE UPDATES** **[*Read

## I have a dog. Should I, um, set up a pad in my home?

Thankfully, no. According to [city
guidelines](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-FAQ.pdf),
you can take your pets outside to relieve themselves, “but only in the
immediate vicinity of your residence.”

## Can I get food delivered?

Yes. Food delivery is considered [essential
work](https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026). (You might want
to tip well if you’re able to, as we are still facing the dangers of the
coronavirus
pandemic.)

## My grocery store is still open 24 hours a day. Can I make a quick snack run?

Technically, no. [The order
bars](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-FAQ.pdf)
anyone who is “not performing essential work from being in public”
during curfew hours.

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Can I take a walk around my block?

Technically, no. The guidelines from the city are clear: Unless you are
performing or traveling to essential work, you should not be in public.

<div id="NYT_MAIN_CONTENT_2_REGION" class="css-9tf9ac">

<div>

</div>

</div>

Are the odds low you’ll catch attention from the police if you’re out
for a stroll? Yes. But would that stroll still be a violation? Also yes.

## Is CitiBike operating? What about Revel?

No and no. Both the [bike and
moped](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-FAQ.pdf)
services will be suspended during curfew hours. This could be a hiccup
for essential workers who rely on these methods of transport.

## What about my backyard or patio?

That should be fine. The curfew guidelines focus on public spaces, and
the outdoor areas attached to your home are presumably not public
spaces.

## I’m an essential worker. Will public transit be running? Can I make a snack run during work?

Yes and yes. Transportation services, including bus, rail, subway, are
still considered essential, so you should be able to take any of them
during curfew hours. The [city is not allowing for-hire
vehicles](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/nyregion/nyc-protests-george-floyd.html),
like Ubers and Lyfts, to operate from 8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., though
yellow and green taxis can operate for essential workers.

(Remember that the subway is still not running between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m.
For more information about reduced subway service and how to get around
it, [click here](https://new.mta.info/coronavirus).)

The city has also carved out exemptions for essential workers who want
to grab food during their shift, so feel free to pop into whichever
bodega you’d like.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## What happens if I violate curfew?

[According to city
guidelines](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-FAQ.pdf),
anyone caught in public during curfew hours who is not exempt “will be
given every opportunity to return home.” Further, “only if an individual
continuously refuses to do so will additional enforcement action be
considered, including but not limited to fines.” (The city didn’t return
a request for comment on clarification.)

## Why was the curfew extended?

[Mayor de
Blasio](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/nyregion/nyc-protests-george-floyd.html#link-30ef7600)explained
his decision to extend the curfew at a news conference on Tuesday,
saying that the new hours would let the police better address “any
situation where someone is trying to do violence to person or property.”

“If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then
please go home, because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” he
added.
