Know}\label{new-york-citys-curfew-what-you-need-to-know}}

Yes, you will most likely need to be indoors, or at least out of any
public area, by 8 p.m.

For the next week, most New York City residents will be required to be
at home, or at least out of public spaces, by 8 p.m. This nightly,
citywide curfew will be in place through the morning of June 8.

Under the
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-119.pdf}{emergency
executive order issued by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday}, anyone not
performing or traveling to or from essential work will be required to be
inside every night from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. This curfew is three hours
earlier than the
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2020/eeo-117.pdf}{11
p.m. deadline} set on June 1 --- and about 20 minutes before sunset.

Additionally, car travel in Manhattan will be banned below 96th Street
during curfew hours, except for local residents, essential workers,
buses and truck deliveries.

So does this mean you're trapped inside, all night? Well, not exactly.

\hypertarget{did-you-say-the-curfew-is-before-sunset}{%
\subsection{Did you say the curfew is before
sunset?}\label{did-you-say-the-curfew-is-before-sunset}}

Yes! The sun was due to set at 8:22 p.m. on June 2, the first night of
the extended-hours curfew --- the second night of curfew over all ---
and is due to set progressively one minute later each night.(The summer
solstice, the longest day of the year, is June 20.)

\hypertarget{to-whom-exactly-does-the-curfew-apply}{%
\subsection{To whom, exactly, does the curfew
apply?}\label{to-whom-exactly-does-the-curfew-apply}}

In a nutshell: Unless you absolutely need to be outside for work or for
medical reasons, the curfew applies to you.

The people exempt from the curfew are the ones you would expect: police
and peace officers, firefighters, emergency medical workers and
technicians, anyone seeking medical treatment or supplies, and anyone
performing or traveling to or from essential work, like food delivery,
transit and health care. Those who are homeless are also exempt.

\subsection{I have a dog. Should I, um, set up a pad in my
home?}\label{i-have-a-dog-should-i-um-set-up-a-pad-in-my-home}}

Thankfully, no. According to
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-FAQ.pdf}{city
guidelines}, you can take your pets outside to relieve themselves, ``but
only in the immediate vicinity of your residence.''

\hypertarget{can-i-get-food-delivered}{%
\subsection{Can I get food delivered?}\label{can-i-get-food-delivered}}

Yes. Food delivery is considered
\href{https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026}{essential work}.
(You might want to tip well if you're able to, as we are still facing
the dangers of the coronavirus pandemic.)

run?}\label{my-grocery-store-is-still-open-24-hours-a-day-can-i-make-a-quick-snack-run}}

Technically, no.
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-FAQ.pdf}{The
order bars} anyone who is ``not performing essential work from being in
public'' during curfew hours.

\hypertarget{can-i-take-a-walk-around-my-block}{%
\subsection{Can I take a walk around my
block?}\label{can-i-take-a-walk-around-my-block}}

Technically, no. The guidelines from the city are clear: Unless you are
performing or traveling to essential work, you should not be in public.

Are the odds low you'll catch attention from the police if you're out
for a stroll? Yes. But would that stroll still be a violation? Also yes.

\hypertarget{is-citibike-operating-what-about-revel}{%
\subsection{Is CitiBike operating? What about
Revel?}\label{is-citibike-operating-what-about-revel}}

No and no. Both the
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-FAQ.pdf}{bike
and moped} services will be suspended during curfew hours. This could be
a hiccup for essential workers who rely on these methods of transport.

\hypertarget{what-about-my-backyard-or-patio}{%
\subsection{What about my backyard or
patio?}\label{what-about-my-backyard-or-patio}}

That should be fine. The curfew guidelines focus on public spaces, and
the outdoor areas attached to your home are presumably not public
spaces.

\hypertarget{im-an-essential-worker-will-public-transit-be-running-can-i-make-a-snack-run-during-work}{%
\subsection{I'm an essential worker. Will public transit be running? Can
I make a snack run during
work?}\label{im-an-essential-worker-will-public-transit-be-running-can-i-make-a-snack-run-during-work}}

Yes and yes. Transportation services, including bus, rail, subway, are
still considered essential, so you should be able to take any of them
during curfew hours. The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/nyregion/nyc-protests-george-floyd.html}{city
is not allowing for-hire vehicles}, like Ubers and Lyfts, to operate
from 8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m., though yellow and green taxis can operate for
essential workers.

(Remember that the subway is still not running between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m.
For more information about reduced subway service and how to get around
it, \href{https://new.mta.info/coronavirus}{click here}.)

The city has also carved out exemptions for essential workers who want
to grab food during their shift, so feel free to pop into whichever
bodega you'd like.

\hypertarget{what-happens-if-i-violate-curfew}{%
\subsection{What happens if I violate
curfew?}\label{what-happens-if-i-violate-curfew}}

\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Curfew-FAQ.pdf}{According
to city guidelines}, anyone caught in public during curfew hours who is
not exempt ``will be given every opportunity to return home.'' Further,
``only if an individual continuously refuses to do so will additional
enforcement action be considered, including but not limited to fines.''
(The city didn't return a request for comment on clarification.)

\hypertarget{why-was-the-curfew-extended}{%
\subsection{Why was the curfew
extended?}\label{why-was-the-curfew-extended}}

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/nyregion/nyc-protests-george-floyd.html\#link-30ef7600}{Mayor
de Blasio}explained his decision to extend the curfew at a news
conference on Tuesday, saying that the new hours would let the police
better address ``any situation where someone is trying to do violence to
person or property.''

``If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then
please go home, because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,'' he
added.
