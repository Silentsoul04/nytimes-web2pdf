Again, California is aflame — and it isn’t close to being over yet.

As of Tuesday, more than [two million acres have burned across the
state](https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/) so far in 2020,
which makes this a record year, surpassing 2018, according to the
California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>About 200 Labor Day
visitors to the Sierra National Forest [had to be evacuated by
helicopter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/06/us/mammoth-pools-fires-california.html)
after being trapped by the Creek Fire, and Governor Gavin Newsom
[declared a state of
emergency](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.6.20-September-Fires-Emergency.pdf)
in five counties.

High temperatures and strong winds have made the situation even worse.
A[heat wave baked Southern California over the
weekend](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/california-weather.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur)(Los
Angeles County hit a record 121 degrees) [and Death Valley recently
reached 130
degrees](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/climate/death-valley-hottest-temperature-on-earth.html),
which, if confirmed, would be the highest temperature ever reliably
recorded on the planet.

Residents being evacuated must weigh the risks of seeking refuge [in
evacuation shelters in the midst of the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/us/ca-wildfires-covid.html)
and people living far beyond the burn zone are struggling with the
[smoke](https://twitter.com/NWSBayArea/status/1296355443158036481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1296355443158036481%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F08%2F20%2Fus%2Fca-fires.html).

What is it about California that makes
[wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/california-wildfires-helicopter-rescue.html)
so catastrophic? There are four key ingredients.

## The (changing) climate

The first is California’s climate.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

“Fire, in some ways, is a very simple thing,” said Park Williams, a
bioclimatologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory. “As long as stuff is dry enough and there’s a spark, then
that stuff will
burn.”

[California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/30/us/getty-fire-california-kincade.html),
like much of the West, gets most of its moisture in the fall and winter.
Its vegetation then spends much of the summer slowly drying out because
of a lack of rainfall and warmer temperatures. That vegetation then
serves as kindling for fires.

*\[Follow our live* [*California wildfires map
tracker*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/20/us/california-wildfire-maps.html)*.\]*

But while California’s climate has always been fire prone, [the link
between climate change and bigger fires is
inextricable](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001210).
“This climate-change connection is straightforward: warmer temperatures
dry out fuels. In areas with abundant and very dry fuels, all you need
is a spark,” he said.

“In pretty much every single way, a perfect recipe for fire is just kind

perfect conditions for fire, as long as people are there to start the
fires. But then climate change, in a few different ways, seems to also
load the dice toward more fire in the
future.”

## People

Even if the conditions are right for a wildfire, you still need
something or someone to ignite it. Sometimes the trigger is nature, like
the unusual lightning strikes that set off the LNU Lightning Complex
fires in August, but more often than not humans are responsible, said
Nina S. Oakley, a research scientist at the Center for Western Weather
and Water Extremes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
University of California, San Diego.

Many deadly fires have been [started by downed power
lines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/03/18/business/pge-california-wildfires.html).
The 2018 Carr Fire, the state’s sixth-largest on record, started when a
truck blew out its tire and its rim scraped the pavement, sending out
sparks. And some are started through bad decisions, like the fire that
was ignited over the weekend by smoke-generating fireworks [as part of a
gender-reveal
party](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/us/gender-reveal-party-wildfire.html)
and has consumed thousands of acres east of Los Angeles; [Cal Fire says
the fire is currently 16 percent
contained](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/9/5/el-dorado-fire/).

Dr. Oakley,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>was driving away
from her home in Santa Rosa, Calif., on Tuesday with her husband,
another climate scientist, Benjamin Hatchett of the Desert Research
Institute in Reno, Nev., to the ocean to get a respite from the smoke
over her home and<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>power outages
that made it impossible to work. Events like gender reveal parties can
trigger a blaze, she noted, but “you also have the human contribution to
wildfire,” which includes the warming that has been caused by greenhouse
gas emissions and the accompanying increased drying. Both contribute “to
creating a situation favorable to wildfire,” she said. Dr. Hatchett
called it a “perfectly primed scenario” for this disaster.

<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

“California has a lot of people and a really long dry season,” Dr.
Williams said. “People are always creating possible sparks, and as the
dry season wears on and stuff is drying out more and more, the chance
that a spark comes off a person at the wrong time just goes up. And
that’s putting aside arson.”

There’s another way people have contributed to wildfires: in their
choices of where to live. [People are increasingly moving into areas
near
forests](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/15/climate/california-fires-wildland-urban-interface.html),
known as the urban-wildland interface, that are inclined to
burn.

## Fire suppression

It’s counterintuitive, but the United States’ history of suppressing
[wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/03/18/business/pge-california-wildfires.html)
has actually made present-day wildfires worse.

“For the last century we fought fire, and we did pretty well at it
across all of the Western United States,” Dr. Williams said. “And every
time we fought a fire successfully, that means that a bunch of stuff
that would have burned didn’t burn. And so over the last hundred years
we’ve had an accumulation of plants in a lot of areas.

“And so in a lot of [California now when fires
start](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2019/03/18/business/pge-california-wildfires.html),
those fires are burning through places that have a lot more plants to
burn than they would have if we had been allowing fires to burn for the
last hundred years.”

In recent years, the United States Forest Service has been trying to
rectify the previous practice through the use of prescribed or
“controlled” burns.

## The Santa Ana winds

The second and stage of this year’s fire season is yet to come.

Each fall, strong gusts known as the Santa Ana winds bring dry air from
the Great Basin area of the West into Southern California, said Fengpeng
Sun, an assistant professor in the department of geosciences at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City.

Dr. Sun is a co-author of a [2015
study](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/094005)
that suggests that California has two distinct fire seasons. One, which
runs from June through September and is driven by a combination of
warmer and drier weather, is the Western fire season that most people
think of. Those wildfires tend to be more inland, in higher-elevation
forests.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

But Dr. Sun and his co-authors also identified a second fire season that
runs from October through April and is driven by the Santa Ana winds.
Those fires tend to spread three times faster and burn closer to urban
areas, and they were responsible for 80 percent of the economic losses
over two decades beginning in 1990.

It’s not just that the Santa Ana winds dry out vegetation; they also
move embers around, spreading fires.

Which brings us back to climate change.

Ultimately, determining the links between any individual fire and
climate change takes time, and analysis from the evolving discipline of
[attribution
science](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/08/02/science/looking-quickly-for-the-fingerprints-of-climate-change.html).
But the effects of the greenhouse gases humans produce underlie
everything that occurs in the atmosphere, and the tendency of climate
change to make dry places more dry over time is a warning to the West of
a fiery future.
