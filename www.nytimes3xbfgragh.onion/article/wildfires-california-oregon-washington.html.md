[Wildfires](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/wildfires-help-ca-or-wa.html)
are burning across the West, plunging California and other states into
compounding crises. As residents confront the fires, the pall of smoke
they create, the region’s continuing heat wave and related challenges,
here are answers to some essential questions.

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## How does this year compare to other wildfire seasons?

This year [is one of the
worst](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/california-fires-why-this-year-is-different.html).

Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency, reported on Thursday that
firefighters were battling 29 major fires across the state, and that
more than 3.1 million acres have burned this year, far outstripping any
previous record in the state’s history.

The August Complex fire, which started last month, officially became
[the state’s biggest
wildfire](https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/11416/top20_acres.pdf) ever
recorded, burning 471,185 acres. The third and fourth biggest fires also
started last month.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

At least 23 people have died, including [at least 10
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/fires-oregon-california-wa-state.html?name=styln-california-wildfires&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&impression_id=82af8ab0-f443-11ea-afe2-79a10f00ab83&variant=1_Show#link-790daaac)
in the California mountain communities devastated by the Bear Fire and a
1-year-old baby in Washington. Officials worry that the toll will
continue to rise in coming days and weeks as more places become
accessible to rescuers and investigators.

Whole towns in California, as well as Oregon and Washington, have been
essentially burned to the ground.

Daniel Swain, a California climate expert, said recently that he was
alarmed by the sheer breadth and acreage of the blazes burning at the
same time across a variety of ecosystems. On top of that, it’s still
early in the wildfire season, which scientists have
warned<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>is stretching longer and
longer.

“I’m running out of superlatives,” Mr. Swain said — and that was late
last month.

The fact that the fires this year are layered atop the continuing
coronavirus crisis is another reason that it feels so different. For
millions of Californians, the outdoors are a refuge. But now, smoke has
made the air outside toxic across much of the state, [national forests
are
closed](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD799162),
and some of the places most [treasured by residents could be
damaged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/us/california-fires-big-basin-redwoods.html).

## How did the wildfires start?

Most of the fires in California are caused by people. The El Dorado
Fire, which has grown to more than 10,000 acres, was ignited when a
family [used a “pyrotechnic
device”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/us/gender-reveal-party-wildfire.html)
to announce the gender of a new baby.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Many others are caused by more mundane human actions, like driving [a
car that sends
soot](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/vehicle-malfunction-behind-giant-apple-wildfire-california-officials-say-n1235711)
into dry vegetation, as was the case with the Apple Fire in Southern
California this year.

Still others have been caused by power transmission lines or other
utility equipment, which may spark and ignite fires in remote areas.
Pacific Gas and Electric equipment [caused the deadly Camp
Fire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/15/business/pge-fire.html)
in 2018.

In Oregon, [The Statesman Journal
reported](https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2020/09/08/oregon-wildfires-santiam-canyon-fires-caused-downed-power-lines/5744657002/)
that fires in the Santiam Canyon area were ignited when falling trees
knocked down power lines.

But sometimes natural phenomena are to blame, igniting fires in
unavoidable ways. Unusual dry lightning storms sparked some of the
biggest blazes.

While it often takes investigators until long after fires have been
extinguished to determine what caused them, this year, [officials have
had to counter false social media rumors and
misinformation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/antifa-wildfires.html?)
that the blazes were set by antifascist activists.

“We’re not seeing any indications of a mass politically influenced arson
campaign,” said Joy Krawczyk, a spokeswoman with the Oregon Department
of Forestry.

Once the fires get started, fierce winds [have blown them out of
control](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?#link-54181b61)
up and down the West Coast.

## Does climate change play a role?

Experts say that climate change is driving the severity of the fires —
how big they get, how quickly they spread, and how difficult it is to
fight them as they bear down on communities.

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

This year’s fires have been made worse by a [record-shattering heat
wave](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/california-heat-wave.html?),
which scientists have said is part of the region’s [increasingly extreme
swings](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/01/us/california-today-extreme-weather-forecast.html)
between hot, dry weather, when fires are likely to start, and heavy rain
that spurs the growth of plants that will become fuel for fires the next
time the weather turns hot and dry.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has emphasized the ties between climate
change and the severity of this year’s fires.

“Never have I felt more of a sense of obligation and a sense of purpose
to maintain California’s leadership not only nationally but
internationally to face climate change head on,” he said on
Tuesday.

The legacy of a more than century-long [policy of total fire
suppression](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/climate/wildfires-climate-policy.html)
is also rearing its ugly head, experts have said. That policy of
extinguishing every fire has harmed ecosystems that naturally depend on
fires to clear space for new growth, as well [as Native American
communities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/14/us/klamath-native-american-food.html)
who have used fire to care for huge swaths of land for millenniums.

## Where are the wildfires burning? Which ones are the most troubling?

There are currently dozens of fires burning across the West and many of
them are exploding in size, threatening communities, as well as fouling
the air for millions of people.

“The wildfire situation in California and Oregon has now escalated to
the point that I can no longer keep track of the countless massive,
fast-moving, and potentially very dangerous fires,” Mr. Swain, the
California climate expert, [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/Weather_West/status/1303458376085508096)
earlier this week. “The geographic scale and intensity of what is
transpiring is truly jarring.”

Meteorologists<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>expressed alarm
at the rapid overnight [growth of the Bear
Fire](https://krcrtv.com/news/local/thousands-scramble-to-escape-bear-fire-as-it-approaches-lake-oroville)
on Wednesday, which [tore through mountain
communities](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?#link-7479402)
and came unsettlingly close to where [the town of
Paradise](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/09/panic-in-paradise-nearby-bear-fire-triggers-locals-who-lost-everything-in-camp-fire-to-evacuate-again/)
was devastated<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>in 2018 by [the
Camp
Fire](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/11/18/us/california-camp-fire-paradise.html),
the deadliest on record in the state. The Bear Fire is part of the North
Complex.

Over the weekend, the [Creek
Fire,](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/9/4/creek-fire/) which
prompted Mr. Newsom to declare a state of [emergency in Fresno, Mariposa
and Madera
Counties](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/california-wildfire-heat-wave.html?name=styln-california-wildfires&region=TOP_BANNER&block=storyline_menu_recirc&action=click&pgtype=Article&impression_id=453ed154-f258-11ea-86d9-af7918bbd709&variant=1_Show),
grew so explosively that members of the California National Guard had to
[rescue trapped campers by
helicopter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/california-wildfires-helicopter-rescue.html?)
from the Sierra National Forest.

## What is the Air Quality Index and is it safe to go outside?

For millions of Californians fortunate enough to be outside the direct
path of the flames, [air
quality](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/climate/california-smoke-wildfires.html)
is a major concern. One look out the window in the Bay Area on Wednesday
morning would yield a pretty clear indication that things were not
normal.

</div>

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

Beyond that, you can check
[AirNow](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/ca-air-quality-index.html),
a website and app run by the Environmental Protection Agency, for the
[Air Quality
Index](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/ca-air-quality-index.html).
The higher the index, the worse the air. Anything above 100 is bad for
sensitive groups — which includes even more people than usual, in light
of the pandemic. Experts have said that poor air quality could aggravate
Covid-19 symptoms or make people cough more, making them more contagious
if they are infected.

Some Bay Area residents [rely on
PurpleAir](https://www2.purpleair.com/), another website that uses data
from air quality sensors around the world.

If the air quality is poor in your area (and it is in much of
California), you should try to stay indoors with the windows closed if
possible. A high-efficiency air filter is helpful as well. Many
Californians, though, have neither option, and must head out to work
each day in [low-paid essential jobs, often in farm
fields](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/climate/california-farm-workers-climate-change.html).

</div>

</div>

<div class="css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn">

<div class="css-53u6y8">

## Why was the sky orange?

According to [the Bay Area Air
District](https://twitter.com/AirDistrict/status/1303746736414883840),
the region’s air pollution control agency, the orange skies around San
Francisco and in much of Oregon and Washington were the result of ash
and smoke from fires, rising high and spread widely by strong winds. The
smoke particles tend to scatter blue light from the sun, while allowing
“yellow-orange-red light to reach the surface, causing skies to look
orange,” the agency [said on
Twitter.](https://twitter.com/AirDistrict/status/1303746927171784704)

If the smoke is thick enough, most of the sun’s light reaching that area
will be scattered and absorbed before reaching the ground, causing those
apocalyptically dark skies during the day.

## Should I wear an N95 mask to protect myself from wildfire smoke?

Ordinarily, the answer would probably be yes — although [a mask is not
as effective as just staying
indoors.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/us/wildfire-smoke-covid-n95-masks.html)

But this is the opposite of an ordinary time, and public health
officials are advising against buying N95 respirator masks for personal
use, because the limited number available may be needed by medical
professionals and other workers who must be outside.

Wearing a more common cloth or surgical mask outside is a good idea —
though it shouldn’t be all you do to protect yourself from smoke, just
as a mask shouldn’t be your only precaution against the spread of the
coronavirus.

## How can we stop fires from happening?

Many experts say that’s the wrong question. Instead, they say,
policymakers must recognize that wildfires will happen, and discourage
or ban development in fire-prone areas. Local leaders must take steps to
make their communities easier to flee on short notice, they say, and
homeowners can do things to keep their homes from being damaged.

Forestry and fire management experts are increasingly saying that
[prescribed
burns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/california-fire-prevention.html)
must become a bigger part of the strategy. In a prescribed burn,
firefighters and other professionals intentionally light fires in areas
where excess vegetation should be cleared, at times when the weather is
not too hot and dry to control the flames. Then when a wildfire strikes
those areas, it won’t burn as hot or as destructively.
