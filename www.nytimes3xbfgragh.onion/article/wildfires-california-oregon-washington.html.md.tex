Wildfires are spreading across California, Washington and Oregon at an
astonishing rate. Here is what you need to know about how they started
and what you can do to protect yourself from the smoke.

This year
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/california-fires-why-this-year-is-different.html}{is
one of the worst}.

Cal Fire, the state's fire agency, reported on Thursday that
firefighters were battling 29 major fires across the state, and that
more than 3.1 million acres have burned this year, far outstripping any
previous record in the state's history.

The August Complex fire, which started last month, officially became
\href{https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/11416/top20_acres.pdf}{the state's
biggest wildfire} ever recorded, burning 471,185 acres. The third and
fourth biggest fires also started last month.

At least 23 people have died, including
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/fires-oregon-california-wa-state.html?name=styln-california-wildfires\&region=TOP_BANNER\&block=storyline_menu_recirc\&action=click\&pgtype=Article\&impression_id=82af8ab0-f443-11ea-afe2-79a10f00ab83\&variant=1_Show\#link-790daaac}{at
least 10 people} in the California mountain communities devastated by
the Bear Fire and a 1-year-old baby in Washington. Officials worry that
the toll will continue to rise in coming days and weeks as more places
become accessible to rescuers and investigators.

Whole towns in California, as well as Oregon and Washington, have been
essentially burned to the ground.

Daniel Swain, a California climate expert, said recently that he was
alarmed by the sheer breadth and acreage of the blazes burning at the
same time across a variety of ecosystems. On top of that, it's still
early in the wildfire season, which scientists have warned is stretching
longer and longer.

``I'm running out of superlatives,'' Mr. Swain said --- and that was
late last month.

The fact that the fires this year are layered atop the continuing
coronavirus crisis is another reason that it feels so different. For
millions of Californians, the outdoors are a refuge. But now, smoke has
made the air outside toxic across much of the state,
\href{https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD799162}{national
forests are closed}, and some of the places most
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/28/us/california-fires-big-basin-redwoods.html}{treasured
by residents could be damaged}.

\hypertarget{how-did-the-wildfires-start}{%
\subsection{How did the wildfires
start?}\label{how-did-the-wildfires-start}}

Most of the fires in California are caused by people. The El Dorado
Fire, which has grown to more than 10,000 acres, was ignited when a
family
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/us/gender-reveal-party-wildfire.html}{used
a ``pyrotechnic device''} to announce the gender of a new baby.

Many others are caused by more mundane human actions, like driving
\href{https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/vehicle-malfunction-behind-giant-apple-wildfire-california-officials-say-n1235711}{a
car that sends soot} into dry vegetation, as was the case with the Apple
Fire in Southern California this year.

Still others have been caused by power transmission lines or other
utility equipment, which may spark and ignite fires in remote areas.
Pacific Gas and Electric equipment
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/15/business/pge-fire.html}{caused
the deadly Camp Fire} in 2018.

In Oregon,
\href{https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2020/09/08/oregon-wildfires-santiam-canyon-fires-caused-downed-power-lines/5744657002/}{The
Statesman Journal reported} that fires in the Santiam Canyon area were
ignited when falling trees knocked down power lines.

But sometimes natural phenomena are to blame, igniting fires in
unavoidable ways. Unusual dry lightning storms sparked some of the
biggest blazes.

While it often takes investigators until long after fires have been
extinguished to determine what caused them, this year,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/antifa-wildfires.html?}{officials
have had to counter false social media rumors and misinformation} that
the blazes were set by antifascist activists.

``We're not seeing any indications of a mass politically influenced
arson campaign,'' said Joy Krawczyk, a spokeswoman with the Oregon
Department of Forestry.

Once the fires get started, fierce winds
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?\#link-54181b61}{have
blown them out of control} up and down the West Coast.

\hypertarget{does-climate-change-play-a-role}{%
\subsection{Does climate change play a
role?}\label{does-climate-change-play-a-role}}

Experts say that climate change is driving the severity of the fires ---
how big they get, how quickly they spread, and how difficult it is to
fight them as they bear down on communities.

This year's fires have been made worse by a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/california-heat-wave.html?}{record-shattering
heat wave}, which scientists have said is part of the region's
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/03/01/us/california-today-extreme-weather-forecast.html}{increasingly
extreme swings} between hot, dry weather, when fires are likely to
start, and heavy rain that spurs the growth of plants that will become
fuel for fires the next time the weather turns hot and dry.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has emphasized the ties between climate
change and the severity of this year's fires.

``Never have I felt more of a sense of obligation and a sense of purpose
to maintain California's leadership not only nationally but
internationally to face climate change head on,'' he said on Tuesday.

The legacy of a more than century-long

said. That policy of extinguishing every fire has harmed ecosystems that

\subsection{Where are the wildfires burning? Which ones are the most
troubling?}\label{where-are-the-wildfires-burning-which-ones-are-the-most-troubling}}

There are currently dozens of fires burning across the West and many of
them are exploding in size, threatening communities, as well as fouling
the air for millions of people.

``The wildfire situation in California and Oregon has now escalated to
the point that I can no longer keep track of the countless massive,
fast-moving, and potentially very dangerous fires,'' Mr. Swain, the
California climate expert,
\href{https://twitter.com/Weather_West/status/1303458376085508096}{wrote
on Twitter} earlier this week. ``The geographic scale and intensity of
what is transpiring is truly jarring.''

Meteorologists expressed alarm at the rapid overnight
\href{https://krcrtv.com/news/local/thousands-scramble-to-escape-bear-fire-as-it-approaches-lake-oroville}{growth
of the Bear Fire} on Wednesday, which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/wildfires-live-updates.html?\#link-7479402}{tore
through mountain communities} and came unsettlingly close to where
\href{https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/09/panic-in-paradise-nearby-bear-fire-triggers-locals-who-lost-everything-in-camp-fire-to-evacuate-again/}{the
town of Paradise} was devastated in 2018 by
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/11/18/us/california-camp-fire-paradise.html}{the
Camp Fire}, the deadliest on record in the state. The Bear Fire is part
of the North Complex.

Over the weekend, the
\href{https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/9/4/creek-fire/}{Creek
Fire,} which prompted Mr. Newsom to declare a state of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/california-wildfire-heat-wave.html?name=styln-california-wildfires\&region=TOP_BANNER\&block=storyline_menu_recirc\&action=click\&pgtype=Article\&impression_id=453ed154-f258-11ea-86d9-af7918bbd709\&variant=1_Show}{emergency

members of the California National Guard had to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/california-wildfires-helicopter-rescue.html?}{rescue
trapped campers by helicopter} from the Sierra National Forest.

\hypertarget{what-is-the-air-quality-index-and-is-it-safe-to-go-outside}{%
\subsection{What is the Air Quality Index and is it safe to go
outside?}\label{what-is-the-air-quality-index-and-is-it-safe-to-go-outside}}

For millions of Californians fortunate enough to be outside the direct
path of the flames,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/climate/california-smoke-wildfires.html}{air
quality} is a major concern. One look out the window in the Bay Area on
Wednesday morning would yield a pretty clear indication that things were
not normal.

Beyond that, you can check
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/ca-air-quality-index.html}{AirNow},
a website and app run by the Environmental Protection Agency, for the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/ca-air-quality-index.html}{Air
Quality Index}. The higher the index, the worse the air. Anything above
100 is bad for sensitive groups --- which includes even more people than
usual, in light of the pandemic. Experts have said that poor air quality
could aggravate Covid-19 symptoms or make people cough more, making them
more contagious if they are infected.

Some Bay Area residents \href{https://www2.purpleair.com/}{rely on
PurpleAir}, another website that uses data from air quality sensors
around the world.

If the air quality is poor in your area (and it is in much of
California), you should try to stay indoors with the windows closed if
possible. A high-efficiency air filter is helpful as well. Many
Californians, though, have neither option, and must head out to work
each day in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/climate/california-farm-workers-climate-change.html}{low-paid
essential jobs, often in farm fields}.

\hypertarget{why-was-the-sky-orange}{%
\subsection{Why was the sky orange?}\label{why-was-the-sky-orange}}

According to
\href{https://twitter.com/AirDistrict/status/1303746736414883840}{the
Bay Area Air District}, the region's air pollution control agency, the
orange skies around San Francisco and in much of Oregon and Washington
were the result of ash and smoke from fires, rising high and spread
widely by strong winds. The smoke particles tend to scatter blue light
from the sun, while allowing ``yellow-orange-red light to reach the
surface, causing skies to look orange,'' the agency
\href{https://twitter.com/AirDistrict/status/1303746927171784704}{said
on Twitter.}

If the smoke is thick enough, most of the sun's light reaching that area
will be scattered and absorbed before reaching the ground, causing those
apocalyptically dark skies during the day.

\hypertarget{should-i-wear-an-n95-mask-to-protect-myself-from-wildfire-smoke}{%
\subsection{Should I wear an N95 mask to protect myself from wildfire
smoke?}\label{should-i-wear-an-n95-mask-to-protect-myself-from-wildfire-smoke}}

Ordinarily, the answer would probably be yes --- although
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/us/wildfire-smoke-covid-n95-masks.html}{a
mask is not as effective as just staying indoors.}

But this is the opposite of an ordinary time, and public health
officials are advising against buying N95 respirator masks for personal
use, because the limited number available may be needed by medical
professionals and other workers who must be outside.

Wearing a more common cloth or surgical mask outside is a good idea ---
though it shouldn't be all you do to protect yourself from smoke, just
as a mask shouldn't be your only precaution against the spread of the
coronavirus.

\hypertarget{how-can-we-stop-fires-from-happening}{%
\subsection{How can we stop fires from
happening?}\label{how-can-we-stop-fires-from-happening}}

Many experts say that's the wrong question. Instead, they say,
policymakers must recognize that wildfires will happen, and discourage
or ban development in fire-prone areas. Local leaders must take steps to
make their communities easier to flee on short notice, they say, and
homeowners can do things to keep their homes from being damaged.

Forestry and fire management experts are increasingly saying that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/california-fire-prevention.html}{prescribed
burns} must become a bigger part of the strategy. In a prescribed burn,
firefighters and other professionals intentionally light fires in areas
where excess vegetation should be cleared, at times when the weather is
not too hot and dry to control the flames. Then when a wildfire strikes
those areas, it won't burn as hot or as destructively.
