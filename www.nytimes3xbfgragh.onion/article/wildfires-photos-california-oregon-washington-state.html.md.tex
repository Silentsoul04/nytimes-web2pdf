Wildfires across the West Coast have consumed more than three million
acres in California, burned almost a million acres in Oregon and
destroyed entire towns in Washington as they continued to spread on
Saturday. In Oregon,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/11/us/wildfires-live-updates.html}{500,000
residents} were
\href{https://www.flashalert.net/id/OregonOfficeofEmergencyManagement}{under
evacuation orders or warned they should be ready to flee}, and 40,000
people had left their homes. Dozens of people were reported missing, as
a record-setting fire season continued.

In California,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/fires-map-tracker.html?action=click\&module=Top\%20Stories\&pgtype=Homepage}{hundreds
of fires} blazed across the state, including in the Mendocino National
Forest in Northern California and Fresno in the central part of the
state, as well as areas near Los Angeles and in Silicon Valley.
California's firefighting forces have been stretched thin, preventing
them from sending teams to Oregon, where a number of blazes, including
the Almeda Fire, have caused extensive damage.

Facing a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/10/us/climate-change-california-wildfires.html?action=click\&module=RelatedLinks\&pgtype=Article}{historic
year of wildfire destruction} along the West Coast, the national
emergency systems that rely on state-to-state assistance have been
buckling under the strain. That has left emergency responders struggling
to keep pace with fires that have destroyed entire towns and led to at
least 20 deaths, with seven more people found dead on Thursday as a
result of a fire north of Sacramento.

``What we're experiencing right here is coming to a community all across
the United States of America unless we get our act together on climate
change,''
\href{https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1304540902904348674}{Gov.
Gavin Newsom said on Friday}.
