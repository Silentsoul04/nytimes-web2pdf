Gail Collins joined The New York Times in 1995 as a member of the
editorial board and later as an Op-Ed columnist. In 2001 she was
appointed editorial page editor -- the first woman to hold that post at
The Times.

In 2007, she stepped down to finish her book: ``When Everything Changed:
The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present.'' She
returned as a columnist in time to cover the 2008 presidential election.

Ms. Collins is also the author of ``America's Women: Four Hundred Years
of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates and Heroines,'' and five other books: "When
Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to
the Present," ``As Texas Goes: How the Lone Star State Hijacked the
American Agenda,'' a biography of William Henry Harrison, ``Scorpion
Tongues: Gossip, Celebrity and American Politics,'' and ``The Millennium
Book,'' which she co-authored with her husband, Dan Collins. She is
currently at work on a history of older women in America.

Before joining The Times, Ms. Collins was a columnist at New York
Newsday, The New York Daily News, and a reporter for United Press
International.

She is a graduate of Marquette University, and has a master's degree in
government from the University of Massachusetts. Since 2013, Ms. Collins
has been a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.
