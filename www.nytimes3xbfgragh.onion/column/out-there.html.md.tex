Mr. Overbye's reporting can range from zero-gravity fashion shows and
science in the movies to the status of Pluto, the death of the Earth and
the fate of the universe.

He joined The Times in 1998 as deputy science editor, resuming a
newspaper career that had been disrupted in the ninth grade when he lost
his job as editor of the junior high paper after being in a classroom
after hours where erasers were thrown. In the meantime, he graduated
from M.I.T. with a physics degree, failed to finish a novel and worked
as a writer and editor at Sky and Telescope and Discover magazines.

He has written two books: "Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, The Scientific
Search for the Secret of the Universe" (HarperCollins 1991, and Little,
Brown, 1999), and "Einstein in Love, A Scientific Romance" (Viking,
2000). As a result of the latter, there are few occasions for which he
cannot rustle up a quotation - appropriate or not - from Albert
Einstein.

In 2001, realizing that the reporters were having more fun and got to
take cooler trips than editors, he switched to being a reporter. He has
been covering the universe for more than 30 years, but lately he
professes to be amazed that a huge chunk of his work is devoted to two
topics that did not exist only a decade or so ago: the proliferation of
planets beyond our own solar system; and the mysterious dark energy that
seems to be souping up the expansion of the universe and spurring
metaphysical-sounding debates among astronomers and physicists.

He lives with his wife, Nancy, and daughter, Mira, in Morningside
Heights. In their house, he reports, Pluto is still a planet.
