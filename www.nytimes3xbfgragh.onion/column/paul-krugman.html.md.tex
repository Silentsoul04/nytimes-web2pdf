Paul Krugman joined The New York Times in 1999 as an Op-Ed columnist. He
is distinguished professor in the Graduate Center Economics Ph.D.
program and distinguished scholar at the Luxembourg Income Study Center
at the City University of New York. In addition, he is professor
emeritus of Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.

In 2008, Mr. Krugman was the sole recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize
in Economic Sciences for his work on international trade theory.

Mr. Krugman received his B.A. from Yale University in 1974 and his Ph.D.
from M.I.T. in 1977. He has taught at Yale, M.I.T. and Stanford. At
M.I.T. he became the Ford International Professor of Economics.

Mr. Krugman is the author or editor of 27 books and more than 200 papers
in professional journals and edited volumes. His professional reputation
rests largely on work in international trade and finance; he is one of
the founders of the ``new trade theory,'' a major rethinking of the
theory of international trade. In recognition of that work, in 1991 the
American Economic Association awarded him its John Bates Clark medal.
Mr. Krugman's current academic research is focused on economic and
currency crises.

At the same time, Mr. Krugman has written extensively for a broader
public audience. Some of his articles on economic issues, originally
published in Foreign Affairs, Harvard Business Review, Scientific
American and other journals, are reprinted in Pop Internationalism and
The Accidental Theorist.
