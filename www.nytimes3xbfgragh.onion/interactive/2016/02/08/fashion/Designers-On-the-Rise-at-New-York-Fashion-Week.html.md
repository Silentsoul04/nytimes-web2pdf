New York Fashion Week is back. The <span class="ins cts-1">twice-a-year
</span>circus of runway shows, presentations, performances and parties
has 147 designers on the [official
schedule](http://newyorkfashionweeklive.com/schedule) this time and will
take place over nine days. That’s a lot of
fashion<span class="ins cts-1">,</span>
<span class="ins cts-1">b</span>ut much less than in past
seasons<span class="ins cts-1">,</span> when there were over 330 shows,
thanks to the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which took
control of the schedule last year. “We continue to streamline, organize
and present it in a way that’s easier for people who are attending shows
to navigate,” <span class="ins cts-2">said Steven Kolb, </span>CFDA
president. “It’s our response to the industry mandate that it be more
curated.”

Looking to get involved this season? Here, a selection of emerging
designers, collection debuts and ones to watch
<span class="ins cts-1">in the next </span>week.

    Jean Touitou, [the outspoken, sometimes-controversial Frenchman who
    founded the brand
    in 1987](http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/10/apc-founder-jean-touitou-fashion-designer-french),

    invited to see <span class="ins cts-2">it</span>. This season, he’ll

**Correction: Feb. 9, 2016**  

An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the clothing
line designed by Sander Lak. It's Sies Marjan, not Marajan. The article
also misstated the number of designers on the official schedule and the
number of shows in past seasons. This year, there are 147 designers on
the official schedule, and there were over 330 shows in past seasons,
not 130 and over
350.
