For the fall 2016 collections, notable debuts, sophomore efforts and
follow-ups to breakthrough moments.

New York Fashion Week is back. The twice-a-year circus of runway shows,
presentations, performances and parties has 147 designers on the
\href{http://newyorkfashionweeklive.com/schedule}{official schedule}
this time and will take place over nine days. That's a lot of fashion,
but much less than in past seasons, when there were over 330 shows,
thanks to the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which took
control of the schedule last year. ``We continue to streamline, organize
and present it in a way that's easier for people who are attending shows
to navigate,'' said Steven Kolb, CFDA president. ``It's our response to
the industry mandate that it be more curated.''

Looking to get involved this season? Here, a selection of emerging
designers, collection debuts and ones to watch in the next week.

  Brother Vellies

  The accessories label
  \href{http://www.brothervellies.com/site/}{Brother Vellies} opened in
  2013 with a commitment to sustainable production in developing African
  countries, and quickly gained a following. (A Kanye West appearance at
  the brand's presentation last season didn't hurt.) Last year, the
  founder and creative director Aurora James was one of the 2015 CFDA
  Vogue Fashion Fund Award winners. On Thursday, she will have her first
  presentation since taking home the \$300,000 prize and a yearlong
  mentorship.

  Ev Bessar

  Before starting her fashion line, \href{http://www.evbessar.com}{Ev
  Bessar} founded HeartED, a foundation for children with congenital
  heart defects. She also studied fashion design at Parsons and worked
  for brands including Three as Four, Rochambeau and Rubin Singer. For
  her N.Y.F.W. debut this season, the Russian-born, New York-based
  designer was inspired by ``The Firebird'' from Russian folklore. Each
  piece is handmade by her in the basement of her home in Harlem, which
  she calls ``the dungeon.'' The runway show is Thursday at Gotham Hall.

  Monse

  When the Oscar de la Renta alumni Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim
  started their label in September 2015, it was celebrated for carrying
  on the sensibility of their former boss, who died in 2014, while
  adding a more youthful, more accessible edge. The buzz for
  \href{http://www.monse.com}{Monse} has only grown since, thanks to
  support from Amal Clooney and Sarah Jessica Parker. This runway show
  is Friday at the High Line Hotel.

  Phelan

  The former Alexander Wang knitwear designer
  \href{http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2016-ready-to-wear/phelan}{Amanda
  Phelan} introduced her line last season with a well-received debut
  presentation. This time around, she will once again put on a
  performance-based runway show featuring dance at La MaMa, the
  experimental theater in the East Village, in collaboration with the
  Vim Vigor Dance Company founder and choreographer, Shannon Gillen, on
  Saturday.

  Pyer Moss

  ****Last season, the \href{https://pyermoss.com}{Pyer Moss} designer
  Kerby Jean-Raymond presented a politically charged collection along
  with a film about police brutality. This season, his collection will
  be styled by the singer and activist Erykah Badu. Mr. Jean-Raymond got
  his start when he was 14, working under Kay Unger while attending the
  High School of Fashion Industries. Now 29, he is going into his fifth
  season showing at N.Y.F.W. with a runway show Saturday at Milk
  Studios.

  Sies Marjan

  Pedigree means a lot in the fashion world. That's why
  \href{http://www.topfash.org/luxury/Fashion/arnault-biver-unveil-tag-heuer-connected-watch.a/sies-marjan-the-new-collection-by-dries-van-noten-s-former-head-of-design.html}{Sies
  Marjan's debut} is one of the most hyped events of N.Y.F.W. Designed
  by Sander Lak, formerly at 3.1 Phillip Lim, Balmain under Christophe
  Decarnin, and, most recently, Dries Van Noten's former head of design,
  the label is backed by Deia L.L.C., a holding company that once
  controlled Ralph Rucci before closing it in 2014. Rucci was known for
  couture-quality production, and now those resources are in the hands
  of Mr. Lak, whose runway show is Sunday.

  Trademark

  Trademark's offbeat sensibility fits perfectly with the current wave
  of celebrating individual style in fashion --- and the
  \href{http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2016-ready-to-wear/trademark}{reasonably
  priced collection has won over many fans}beyond the editors who
  already adore it. The was brand founded in 2013 by the sisters Pookie
  and Louisa Burch, daughters of the Tory Burch founder Chris Burch (and
  former stepdaughters of Tory Burch). For the fall '16 season, they
  found inspiration in the Northern California arts and crafts movement
  of the '60s and '70s. The collection will be presented Wednesday at
  the brand's flagship store on 95 Grand Street.

  The Row

  After
  \href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/29/fashion/the-real-story-behind-the-olsens-move-of-the-row-to-paris-fashion-week.html?_r=0}{a
  one-season hiatus to show in Paris}, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's
  luxury brand, the Row, is returning to New York for a runway show on
  Feb. 15. Good timing, too, as the 2015 CFDA Women's Wear Designers of
  the Year are about to introduce a shoe collection and will reportedly
  open a flagship store on Madison Avenue in May.

  Eckhaus Latta

  The art-minded label \href{http://eckhauslatta.com/}{Eckhaus Latta} is
  on a tear. With a video included in the Hammer Museum Biennial ``Made
  in L.A.,'' and an installation at MoMA PS1's Greater New York
  exhibition, the bicoastal brand founded by Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta,
  both graduates of the Rhode Island School of Design, continues to
  break new ground for fashion. Fashion folks will have to make the trek
  to PS1 in Long Island City, Queens for the runway show on Feb. 15.

  Rosie Assoulin

  Although Rosie Assoulin has been showing during N.Y.F.W. since 2014,
  her moment is seemingly now. She won the
  \href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/06/03/fashion/the-cfda-awards-winners-surprises-speeches-and-clothes.html?_r=0}{2015
  CFDA Swarovski Award for Women's Wear}, and already had a splashy red
  carpet moment this year when
  \href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/02/03/t-magazine/fashion/kristen-wiig-zoolander-rosie-assoulin-dress.html}{Kristen
  Wiig} wore her rainbow Swarovski crystal gown to the Berlin premiere
  of ``Zoolander 2.'' If that wasn't enough to convince you, watch
  Beyoncé do doughnuts in an El Camino wearing a Rosie Assoulin bodysuit
  in the video for her new single, ``Formation,'' which was released
  last week. Ms. Assoulin's presentation will be Feb. 15 in the
  meatpacking district.

  Brandon Maxwell

  Fresh off winning the women's wear award at the Fashion Group
  International Rising Star Awards last month, Brandon Maxwell will have
  his second runway show Feb. 16 at the Monkey Bar on 54th Street. The
  \href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/09/10/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-brandon-maxwell-lady-gaga-meat-dress.html}{stylist
  and designer is known for taking Lady Gaga out of the meat dress} and
  putting her into custom gowns from Azzedine Alaïa, Valentino and
  Atelier Versace, like the one she wore to accept her golden globe
  award for ``American Horror Story: Hotel.'' Less than a year old, Mr.
  Maxwell's line has already been worn by Gwyneth Paltrow, Reese
  Witherspoon and Kate Hudson.
\item
  \includegraphics{http://graphics8.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png}

  A.P.C.

  Despite having strong roots in New York --- the brand's first store
  was opened on Mercer Street in 1993 --- A.P.C. has never presented its
  new collection during N.Y.F.W. Which is a shame, because Jean Touitou,
  \href{http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/feb/10/apc-founder-jean-touitou-fashion-designer-french}{the
  outspoken, sometimes-controversial Frenchman who founded the brand in
  1987}, puts on quite a show for the select group of editors and
  journalists invited to see it. This season, he'll present the new
  clothes and his ideas about politics, music and whatever else is on
  his mind in New York on Feb. 16.
\item
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Correction: Feb. 9, 2016}

An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the clothing
line designed by Sander Lak.~It's~Sies Marjan, not Marajan.~The article
also misstated the number of designers on the official schedule and the
number of shows in past seasons. This year, there are~147 designers on
the~official schedule, and~there were over 330 shows in past seasons,
not 130 and over 350.
