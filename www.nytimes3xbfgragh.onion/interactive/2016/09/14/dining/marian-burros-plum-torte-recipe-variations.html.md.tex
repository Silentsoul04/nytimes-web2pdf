\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1983/09/21/garden/food-notes-the-food-at-59th-and-lex.html}{First
published in 1983}, Marian Burros's plum torte has become
\href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html}{one
of the most popular recipes in the history of The Times}, and it's no
mystery why. There are so many things to love: It's easy, it's
practically no-fail and it's endlessly adaptable. Here are five ways to
make the legendary torte your own, drawn directly from readers who have
done just that.

her original plum torte recipe is here.}}

  \href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html}{1.
  Replace the plums with almost any seasonal fruit: apricots, halved and
  pitted; cranberries or any summer berry; sliced apples, nectarines,
  peaches and pears. Canned and frozen fruit can stand in for fresh.}

  \emph{Made this for the first time using 4 cups of blueberries and
  raspberries (mixed). It was perfect! - Jane F.}

  \emph{I've been using a version of this for years as a cranberry
  holiday bread. - Marie Schappert}

  \emph{I have made this with about a quart of drained canned fruit of
  any type, as well as frozen. I can plums, peaches and pears in season,
  and if a jar fails to seal, you can bake this cake with it rather than
  reprocess the jar. - Jennifer Robinson}

  \href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html}{2.
  Experiment with spices, herbs and extracts: vanilla extract, almond
  extract, nutmeg, ginger, cardamom, rosemary, orange or lemon zest.}

  \emph{I add about a half teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract to the
  batter. This cake is so easy and good. I even memorized the recipe ---
  except my memorization was imperfect and I baked the cake with the
  fruit on the bottom by accident. It still was delicious! - Jane
  Eyrehead}

  \emph{I added a teaspoon of finely minced fresh rosemary to the
  batter\ldots{} nice, subtle flavor. - Gail}

  \href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html}{3.
  Play with the flours. You can add almond or cornmeal flour to the
  all-purpose flour, or swap in gluten-free flour blends, with excellent
  results.}(\href{http://cooking.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/recipes/1015810-crunchy-topped-whole-wheat-plum-cake}{Melissa
  Clark made a version with whole wheat flour.})

  \emph{Made this with gluten-free flour and it turned out Perfectly!
  Everyone loved it. - Suzanne}

  \emph{I substituted 1/2 cup almond meal and 1/2 cup brown rice flour
  for 1 cup of wheat flour. I also added parchment paper over the
  greased bottom of the spring pan. It was delicious served warm. - Mari
  Schappert}

  \emph{Made this last night after tasting the one made by our daughter.
  Used raspberries and blackberries, one basket each, instead of plums,
  and 1/3 cup cornmeal and 2/3 cup flour. Fantastic!!! The cornmeal adds
  a very sophisticated ``Italian'' character to it, very slight crunch,
  and amazing flavor. - John}

  Double, triple, even quadruple it. The batter scales up like a dream,
  and the baked cake freezes well.}

  \emph{This is one of my favorite recipes and has been for many years.
  In addition to plums, I've used blueberries, peaches, apples and
  various combinations of more than one fruit. It also freezes great. I
  line the baking dish with aluminum foil and once baked and cooled
  slightly, turn the baking dish upside down on a plate, peel off the
  foil, then turn it right-side up on another plate. - Deborah}

  \emph{Double the recipe and it fits nicely in 13-by-9-inch disposable
  aluminum pans. - Nellie Armstrong.}

  \emph{Think about making two\ldots{}one is not enough. - Sandra T.}

  \href{http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/09/14/dining/marian-burros-plum-torte-recipe.html}{5.
  Change up the pan. The torte can be baked in any dish provided it's
  approximately 8 to 10 inches in diameter and oven-safe.}

  \emph{Make it in any Pyrex, casserole, anything. - Cynthia}

  \emph{Used my pie plate because my springform pan was nowhere to be
  found. - Kelleryjones}

  \emph{A 9-inch pan gives greater height and moisture to the tart than
  a 10-inch pan. - J. David Nelson}
