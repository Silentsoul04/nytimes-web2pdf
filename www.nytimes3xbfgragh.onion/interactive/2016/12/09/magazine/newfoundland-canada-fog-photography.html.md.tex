Photographs By Noah Kalina

``I love those driving-into-the-mist shots. There's a mystery and
evocative sense to them.''

  \textbf{About}\\
  Fishing villages and peninsulas rim the craggy, unspoiled coastal
  landscape of Newfoundland, northeast of Nova Scotia. The island is
  home at various times of the year to more than 150 species of nesting
  birds and is on the annual route of more than 10,000 migratory whales.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{There's a lot} of fog near where I live in upstate New York, but
I wanted to find the foggiest place on earth. I love fog. It envelops
you. It's as if you're in a giant blanket, and you can barely see in
front or behind you. There's a comfortable nature to that. The
temperature is perfect; there's something so fresh about it. It's as if
you're breathing clouds and then all of a sudden it just goes away, this
fleeting moment.

And for a photographer, fog evens everything out. The land and the sky
become an even exposure. Sometimes when I'm shooting and it's not foggy,
one part of the shot will go bright white to get the detail of another
part, but with fog you're not blowing out any parts of the composition
--- the sky is as important as the land. Fog also provides a sort of
filter, like rubbing Vaseline over your lens. It makes everything look
good.

Not to sound cheesy, but I was kind of hunting the fog in Newfoundland.
I went to specific locations near the Grand Banks on the southeastern
part of the island, where the Labrador Current meets the Gulf Stream,
where the air traveling with a warm current meets a cold current. These
two bodies of water create fog banks all the time around there.
Ultimately, I found the fog, but I also found incredible isolation. This
is a completely barren landscape. The fog matches the mood of this
place.

~-- As told to Jaime Lowe

\textbf{Bird Rock, in Cape Saint Mary's Ecological Reserve.}~``It was
like a transcendent experience to watch all these birds mating on a rock
and this perfectly clear sunset and being totally alone. I set up my
camera to take time-lapse photos, and you can see wooden spikes next to
me, which indicate a sheer drop. I kept thinking if I fell, they would
find the rental car and maybe eventually my family would come looking
for me.''

\textbf{Route 100.}~``That's fog on the horizon. You don't know what is
beyond, but it's like a blanket: You're O.K. when you're in it.''

**Cape Saint Mary's Ecological Reserve.~**``That's the sun setting
behind the information center. It's probably a mile hike from there to
where I was. It was just me and sheep and birds.''

\textbf{The town of Saint Bride's.}

Looking toward~the end of the road in Point Lance.~

``You don't know what is beyond the fog.''

\textbf{The town of Bay Bulls.}~``This is evaporation fog, dissipating
off the water.''

\textbf{Outbuilding at Cape Saint Mary's lighthouse.}~``There are tons
of sheep hanging around this building.~They didn't like that I was in
their area.''

\textbf{Cape Saint Mary's lighthouse.}~``You can barely make out the
lighthouse because the fog is so thick. The air is moving so fast,
coming in off the ocean --- meanwhile, there's a foghorn blasting. The
feeling is intense. All normal senses completely fall away, and you're
lost in it.''

\textbf{Cape Pine lighthouse.}

**The interpretation center at Cape St. Mary's.~**``Something that is
supermundane becomes this mysterious thing.''

**The town of Saint Bride's.~**``I'm at the fence of the Bird Island
Resort. The town is sleepy, small and quiet, with the exception of wind
blowing in your ears.''
