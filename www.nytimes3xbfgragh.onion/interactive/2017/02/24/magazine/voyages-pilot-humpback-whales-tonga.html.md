‘‘They’re so big that you can whiz around fairly quickly. I had a belt
that had my camera clipped on, so I could swim with both arms and both
legs. I was trying to swim around so that the whales were top and back
lit, so that they were outlined.’’

    The South Pacific archipelago of Vava’u, which consists of 61
    islands, is an annual stop each fall for migrating pilot and
    humpback whales and their newborn calves.

<div class="voyages-intro">

**The first few days,** we didn’t see a single whale. But you get a long
way with determination. We saw a group of pilot whales first — seeing
them is very rare. They’re fast and about twice the length of humans.
The next day, we saw a few humpbacks. They did a swim-by, which is like
a minute in real time but felt like an eternity in the water. Later that
day, I saw a mother and her calf, between 4 and 5 weeks old. It seemed
as if he was looking at me. He was really curious, and he came so close
that I couldn’t keep him in one frame. The mother stayed out of the
frame. I don’t think she saw me as a threat.

We had a really magical moment the next day when nine whales had a heat
run. A lot of male whales blow huge bubbles to show off. All you can do
is hold your breath; I did a free-diving course to train for this. At
one point, there were eight males showing off for one female. If you
have ever wondered what it would be like to be as small as a mosquito,
that was it for me. All of a sudden, whales are coming from the left and
the right. We decided that I would just shoot while my swimming partner,
Falanisi Tongia, pulled me in the direction I wanted to go. The whales
were breaching and changing direction and slapping their tails. The tail
that propels the whale has an immense power; I was wearing a full-body
wet suit with the idea that if I was knocked unconscious, I would float.

“It was fun to walk around on Fonuafo’ou Island at night, when all the
crabs come out. I had a headlight, and we were playing hide-and-seek. I
thought it was going to be very tranquil, but you had the sea coming in
from all sides and the sounds of the birds. I didn’t feel lonely; I was
surrounded by the
elements.”
