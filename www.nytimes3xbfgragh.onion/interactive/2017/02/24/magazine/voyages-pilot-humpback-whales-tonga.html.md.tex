Photographs By Klaus Thymann

``They're so big that you can whiz around fairly quickly. I had a belt
that had my camera clipped on, so I could swim with both arms and both
legs. I was trying to swim around so that the whales were top and back
lit, so that they were outlined.''~

  The South Pacific archipelago of Vava'u, which consists of 61 islands,
  is an annual stop each fall for migrating pilot and humpback whales
  and their newborn calves.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The first few days,} we didn't see a single whale. But you get a
long way with determination. We saw a group of pilot whales first ---
seeing them is very rare. They're fast and about twice the length of
humans. The next day, we saw a few humpbacks. They did a swim-by, which
is like a minute in real time but felt like an eternity in the water.
Later that day, I saw a mother and her calf, between 4 and 5 weeks old.
It seemed as if he was looking at me. He was really curious, and he came
so close that I couldn't keep him in one frame. The mother stayed out of
the frame. I don't think she saw me as a threat.

We had a really magical moment the next day when nine whales had a heat
run. A lot of male whales blow huge bubbles to show off. All you can do
is hold your breath; I did a free-diving course to train for this. At
one point, there were eight males showing off for one female. If you
have ever wondered what it would be like to be as small as a mosquito,
that was it for me. All of a sudden, whales are coming from the left and
the right. We decided that I would just shoot while my swimming partner,
Falanisi Tongia, pulled me in the direction I wanted to go. The whales
were breaching and changing direction and slapping their tails. The tail
that propels the whale has an immense power; I was wearing a full-body
wet suit with the idea that if I was knocked unconscious, I would float.

~-- As told to Jaime Lowe

``In this cave there was a school of fish. I had my swimming partner go
in to give a sense of scale. I used a flash, and you can see the light
reflected off the fish.''~

``I put up a one-man tent on this island. When I was gone, there was
nothing left there. Once the wind blew, you couldn't even see my
footsteps.''~

``We saw the pilot whales, and compared with humpbacks, they're small. I
swam as fast as I possibly could to get them in frame.''

``What normally happens with a heat run is that the male whales are
going really fast, and you only get a second with them. These whales
stopped in one spot for about 20 minutes, which is quite rare.''

``I went for a swim on the shallow reef around the island a few times.
I'd see small reef sharks and other fish. There is a strong current for
such a shallow reef.''

``I tried not to move at all while photographing this calf. If I start
moving in three dimensions while the calf is moving as well, it can get
very confusing.''

``It was fun to walk around on Fonuafo'ou Island at night, when all the
crabs come out. I had a headlight, and we were playing hide-and-seek. I
thought it was going to be very tranquil, but you had the sea coming in
from all sides and the sounds of the birds. I didn't feel lonely; I was
surrounded by the elements.''
