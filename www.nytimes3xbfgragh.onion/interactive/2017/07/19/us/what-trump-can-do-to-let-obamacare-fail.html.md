Senate Republicans’ latest effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act [has
collapsed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/25/us/republicans-who-opposed-the-senate-health-care-bills.html),
but President Trump has already made moves to undermine important
provisions of the health law, and there is still more he could
do.

## In progress

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed status-1">

## ***1.*** **Weaken enforcement of the individual mandate.**

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed label">

## *How this would hurt Obamacare:* Fewer healthy people may sign up for insurance, driving up prices for those who need it most, like older people and the sick.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The Affordable Care Act requires all Americans to buy health insurance
or pay a penalty, with exceptions for people with
[hardships](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/hardship-exemption/).

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

While Mr. Trump cannot eliminate the mandate, as Republicans in Congress
sought to do, the Internal Revenue Service has said it [will continue
accepting tax
returns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/15/us/politics/affordable-care-act-obamacare-trump.html)
that do not say whether a filer has been uninsured, weakening its
enforcement of the provision.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The administration could also allow for more exceptions, making it
easier to avoid the tax penalty. It could instruct the I.R.S. to
scrutinize people’s returns less closely. And it could signal publicly
that it does not care about the mandate, which may cause people to be
less likely to sign up, even if they later get hit with a tax
penalty.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed g-status-in-progress">

## In progress

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed status-1">

## ***2.*** **Impose work requirements for Medicaid recipients.**

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed label">

## *How this would hurt Obamacare:* Many people who gained coverage through Medicaid expansion may not be able to afford insurance or participate in the program.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 states expanded Medicaid coverage to
poor adults who were previously uncovered. And Republicans in Congress
sought to sharply curtail federal support for the expansion, likely
causing many states to end it.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally prevent states from expanding Medicaid in
the future. He could, however, allow states that apply to impose work
requirements or charge premiums for more Medicaid beneficiaries, through
a process that lets the government waive the normal Medicaid rules.
Those changes might make it difficult for as many poor Americans to
access the system.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In March, the Health and Human Services Department said it would be open
to states’ [proposing work
requirements](https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/empowering-patients/providing-relief-right-now-for-patients/making-medicaid-work-for-patients-and-states/index.html)
for Medicaid
recipients.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed g-status-in-progress">

## In progress

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed status-1">

## ***3.*** **Fail to do advertising or outreach.**

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed label">

## *How this would hurt Obamacare:* Without outreach, the number of Americans who learn about the Affordable Care Act and sign up for coverage could dwindle.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The Trump administration said in August that it would [slash spending on
advertising and
promotion](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/31/health/affordable-care-act-trump-spending.html)
for enrollment to $10 million from $100 million. It also said it would
cut funding, by about 40 percent, to groups that help people enroll.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The Department of Health and Human Services, which is in charge of
administering the health law, has also been waging a
[multipronged](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/04/us/hhs-anti-obamacare-campaign.html?mcubz=0)[media
campaign](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/04/us/hhs-anti-obamacare-campaign.html?mcubz=0)
to undermine it, using videos, Twitter posts and the agency’s website.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The last sign-up period for the Affordable Care Act ended 11 days after
[Mr. Trump was
inaugurated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-day.html).
During the those final days of enrollment, the Trump administration
[pulled advertisements and
outreach](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/26/us/politics/donald-trump-obamacare-ads.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Frobert-pear&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=5&pgtype=collection)
off the air that encouraged people to sign up for health insurance under
the law.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In the last few years, large number of consumers generally signed up
just before the deadline, and sign-ups for health plans in states
managed by the federal government were down slightly compared to the
same period the previous year. Lower signups tend to mean higher prices,
since the sickest customers are more likely to investigate their
insurance options, regardless of government
outreach.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed g-status-in-progress">

## In progress

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed status-1">

## ***4.*** **Make tax credits for premiums less generous.**

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed label">

## *How this would hurt Obamacare:* Many customers may end up with plans with higher deductibles and co-payments.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The Affordable Care Act gives tax credits to middle-income Americans to
offset the cost of premiums. Those subsidies are based on a particular
plan, meant to cover 70 percent of the average customer’s medical bills.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The administration put in place a [new
rule](https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2017-Press-releases-items/2017-04-13-2.html)
that in 2018 will make the credits apply to a slightly less generous
plan for all Obamacare customers. The size of the changes will be much
smaller than reductions that had been proposed in the Republican health
care bills. But many customers will end up with either more expensive
insurance or plans that have higher deductibles and co-payments in
2018.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed g-status-not-in-progress">

## A possibility

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed status-3">

## ***5.*** **Defund subsidies that help people pay out-of-pocket costs.**

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed label">

## *How this would hurt Obamacare:* Insurance companies would take a big financial hit, since they assumed they would get the subsidies when pricing their plans.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Obamacare provides subsidies to help insurance companies reduce
out-of-pocket costs, like deductibles and co-payments, for lower-income
customers. Insurance companies price their plans assuming payments will
be based on how many eligible customers they serve. The House and Senate
health bills would have eliminated the subsidies, allowing insurers to
charge those customers higher deductibles.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mr. Trump could effectively defund the subsidies if he [stops the appeal
of a
lawsuit](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/24/upshot/trumps-choice-on-obamacare-sabotage-or-co-opt.html)
that was started under the Obama administration. President Barack
Obama’s lawyers had appealed a court ruling that said the subsidy
payments were made without proper congressional authority.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Removing the subsidies this year would cause insurers to lose money
right away, and it could create substantial financial distress for
smaller insurers. On Wednesday, insurers must sign final contracts for
2018 policies. Because of the uncertainty, many have increased their
prices and some have decided to exit the market, reducing consumer
choices.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The White House has [declined to
say](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/18/upshot/obamacares-future-now-depends-on-an-unhappy-white-house.html)
whether it will continue to pay the
subsidies.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed g-status-not-in-progress">

## A possibility

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed status-3">

## ***6.*** **Redefine essential health benefits.**

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed label">

## *How this would hurt Obamacare:* Customers with health problems may end up with really high insurance costs.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Under the current law, all insurers must offer [10 categories of
essential health
benefits](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/03/24/us/essential-health-benefits.html),
like maternity treatment and hospital care. Conservatives considered the
requirements too restrictive.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Congress tried to loosen these rules by letting states apply to waive
them. Republicans in the Senate also tried to let insurers get away with
offering plans that don’t meet the rules as long as they offered ones
that did.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Mr. Trump cannot eliminate the 10 broad categories of benefits, but his
administration has some discretion on how the categories are defined.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

For example, the administration could redefine preventive care in a way
that eliminates a current rule requiring insurers to cover every form of
contraception that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
