Senate Republicans' latest effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act

important provisions of the health law, and there is still more he could
do.

The Affordable Care Act requires all Americans to buy health insurance
or pay a penalty, with exceptions for people with
\href{https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/hardship-exemption/}{hardships}.

While Mr. Trump cannot eliminate the mandate, as Republicans in Congress
sought to do, the Internal Revenue Service has said it
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/02/15/us/politics/affordable-care-act-obamacare-trump.html}{will
continue accepting tax returns} that do not say whether a filer has been
uninsured, weakening its enforcement of the provision.

The administration could also allow for more exceptions, making it
easier to avoid the tax penalty. It could instruct the I.R.S. to
scrutinize people's returns less closely. And it could signal publicly
that it does not care about the mandate, which may cause people to be
less likely to sign up, even if they later get hit with a tax penalty.

Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 states expanded Medicaid coverage to
poor adults who were previously uncovered. And Republicans in Congress
sought to sharply curtail federal support for the expansion, likely
causing many states to end it.

Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally prevent states from expanding Medicaid in
the future. He could, however, allow states that apply to impose work
requirements or charge premiums for more Medicaid beneficiaries, through
a process that lets the government waive the normal Medicaid rules.
Those changes might make it difficult for as many poor Americans to
access the system.

In March, the Health and Human Services Department said it would be open
to states'
\href{https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/empowering-patients/providing-relief-right-now-for-patients/making-medicaid-work-for-patients-and-states/index.html}{proposing
work requirements} for Medicaid recipients.

The Trump administration said in August that it would
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/31/health/affordable-care-act-trump-spending.html}{slash
spending on advertising and promotion} for enrollment to \$10 million
from \$100 million. It also said it would cut funding, by about 40
percent, to groups that help people enroll.

The Department of Health and Human Services, which is in charge of
administering the health law, has also been waging a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/04/us/hhs-anti-obamacare-campaign.html?mcubz=0}{multipronged}\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/09/04/us/hhs-anti-obamacare-campaign.html?mcubz=0}{media
campaign} to undermine it, using videos, Twitter posts and the agency's
website.

The last sign-up period for the Affordable Care Act ended 11 days after
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-inauguration-day.html}{Mr.
Trump was inaugurated}. During the those final days of enrollment, the
Trump administration

advertisements and outreach} off the air that encouraged people to sign
up for health insurance under the law.

In the last few years, large number of consumers generally signed up
just before the deadline, and sign-ups for health plans in states
managed by the federal government were down slightly compared to the
same period the previous year. Lower signups tend to mean higher prices,
since the sickest customers are more likely to investigate their
insurance options, regardless of government outreach.

The Affordable Care Act gives tax credits to middle-income Americans to
offset the cost of premiums. Those subsidies are based on a particular
plan, meant to cover 70 percent of the average customer's medical bills.

The administration put in place a
\href{https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2017-Press-releases-items/2017-04-13-2.html}{new
rule} that in 2018 will make the credits apply to a slightly less
generous plan for all Obamacare customers. The size of the changes will
be much smaller than reductions that had been proposed in the Republican
health care bills. But many customers will end up with either more
expensive insurance or plans that have higher deductibles and
co-payments in 2018.

Obamacare provides subsidies to help insurance companies reduce
out-of-pocket costs, like deductibles and co-payments, for lower-income
customers. Insurance companies price their plans assuming payments will
be based on how many eligible customers they serve. The House and Senate
health bills would have eliminated the subsidies, allowing insurers to
charge those customers higher deductibles.

Mr. Trump could effectively defund the subsidies if he
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/24/upshot/trumps-choice-on-obamacare-sabotage-or-co-opt.html}{stops
the appeal of a lawsuit} that was started under the Obama
administration. President Barack Obama's lawyers had appealed a court
ruling that said the subsidy payments were made without proper
congressional authority.

Removing the subsidies this year would cause insurers to lose money
right away, and it could create substantial financial distress for
smaller insurers. On Wednesday, insurers must sign final contracts for
2018 policies. Because of the uncertainty, many have increased their
prices and some have decided to exit the market, reducing consumer
choices.

The White House has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/18/upshot/obamacares-future-now-depends-on-an-unhappy-white-house.html}{declined
to say} whether it will continue to pay the subsidies.

Under the current law, all insurers must offer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2017/03/24/us/essential-health-benefits.html}{10
categories of essential health benefits}, like maternity treatment and
hospital care. Conservatives considered the requirements too
restrictive.

Congress tried to loosen these rules by letting states apply to waive
them. Republicans in the Senate also tried to let insurers get away with
offering plans that don't meet the rules as long as they offered ones
that did.

Mr. Trump cannot eliminate the 10 broad categories of benefits, but his
administration has some discretion on how the categories are defined.

For example, the administration could redefine preventive care in a way
that eliminates a current rule requiring insurers to cover every form of
contraception that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
