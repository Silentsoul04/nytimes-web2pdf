interview](http://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/t-magazine/100000005574909/jayz-interview.html)

</div>

<div class="g-item intro">

<div class="g-item g-text">

My conversation with Jay-Z began with O.J.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

When I was a kid growing up in black New Orleans in the 1960s, O.J.
Simpson was a god. We imitated his moves, his swagger. We didn’t want to
just play like him. We wanted to be him, gorgeous and running in the
California sun. We practiced his juking moves in the mirror, our hands
too small to hold the ball loosely, the way he did. We even wanted to go
to U.S.C., where he led the nation in rushing two years in a row. We
were angry when he lost the Heisman Trophy to the white, All-American,
clean-cut U.C.L.A. quarterback Gary Beban, known as “The Great One.” We
were triumphant when he won it the next year.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But O.J. was not a perfect hero for young black boys, even though he
launched himself from poverty in San Francisco to superstardom. He was
racially ambivalent. At a time when other athletes were starting to make
their blackness a cause, he was trying to make his a footnote.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

So when I was invited to interview Jay-Z, I wanted to talk about his
song “The Story of O.J.,” from his most recent album, “4:44,” in which
he quotes the legendary, maybe apocryphal, Simpson line “I’m not black,
I’m O.J.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I was less engaged by the rapper’s marital troubles or his infamous,
caught-on-video 2014 elevator dust-up with his sister-in-law. But I did
want to try to understand how, with an $88 million Bel Air mansion a
freeway ride from neighborhoods where black people endure with so
little, Jay-Z holds onto his younger self — a black man who grew up in
the ’70s in the Marcy projects of Brooklyn. It seemed from his new body
of work that examining this high-wire act of straddling two places had
been stirring more deeply within him — much the way it stirs in me, a
Southern black man who grew up revering O.J. and whose own success is
infinitely greater than anyone in my early life would have imagined for
me.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

What is it about the story of O.J. Simpson that moved us both?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

O.J. must have locked down part of himself when he presented himself as
the noncontroversial star who never talked about race, the perfect foil
for his fellow football player, Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown,
who seemed more threatening, angry. I had to wonder if the pressure of
that denial caused him to explode decades later.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

All of this was on my mind when I met with Jay-Z for two hours in an
executive office at The Times this past September. Besides O.J. and
racial identity, we talked about his mother’s sexuality, and how he
could possibly raise socially aware children who shuttled between
mansions: After years of rapping about growing up in the ‘hood, he has
produced an album that sounds like a middle-aged black man’s deeply
introspective therapy session put to music.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Morris, critic at large for The New York Times, and Reggie Ugwu, pop

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>DEAN BAQUET</span>First, welcome.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span>Thank you.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> The things I want to talk to you about: I want to
talk a little bit about race. Your music some, too. I thought the song
\["[The Story of O.J.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0),"
from the album "[4:44](https://listen.tidal.com/album/75413011)," 2017\]
was particularly powerful. I took the message as, "You can be rich, you
can be poor, you're still black." Who were you speaking to? Who did you
want to listen to that and be moved by it?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> It's a nuanced song, you know. It's like, I'm
specifically speaking to us. And about who we are and how do you
maintain the sense of self while pushing it forward and holding us to
have a responsibility for our actions. Because in America, it is what it
is. And there's a solution for us: If we had a power base together, it
would be a much different conversation than me having a conversation by
myself and trying to change America by myself. If I come with 40 million
people, there's a different conversation, right? It's just how it works.
I can effect change and get whomever in office because this many people,
we're all on the same page. Right? So the conversation is, like, "I'm
not rich, I'm O.J." For us to get in that space and then disconnect from
the culture. That's how it starts. This is what happens. And then you
know what happens? You're on your own, and you see how that turned out.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Was it a reminder, too, that the thing O.J. forgot,
maybe, was that as rich as he was, as entitled as his life was, he was
reminded very forcefully when he became a subject of racial debate that
he was also a black man, whether he accepted that or
not?

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> That's right. Absolutely. And for us, like I'm
saying, to speak to that the point is, "Don't forget that," because
that's really not the goal. The goal is not to be successful and famous.
That's not the goal. The goal is, if you have a specific God-given
ability, is to live your life out through that. One. And two, we have a
responsibility to push the conversation forward until we're all equal.
Till we're all equal in this place. Because until everyone's free, no
one's free, and that's just a fact.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> When you're as amazingly successful as you are, your
kids will live in a very different world from the world you grew up in.
How do you go about making sure that they understand the world you grew
up in?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> There's a delicate balance to that, right? Because
you have to educate your children on the world as it exists today and
how it got to that space, but my child doesn't need the same tools that
I needed growing up. I needed certain tools to survive my area that my
child doesn't need. They're growing up in a different
environment.<sup>1</sup> But also they have to know their history. Have
a sense of what it took to get to this place. And have compassion for
others. The most important thing I think out of all this is to teach
compassion and to identify with everyone's struggle and to know these
people made these sacrifices for us to be where we are and to push that
forward — for us. I believe that's the most important thing to show
them, because they don't have to know things that I knew growing up.
Like being
tough.

</div>

<div class="g-annotation-body">

<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>1</sup>Reggie Ugwu:</span> Jay-Z
anticipated this dilemma on the 2011 song "[New
Day](https://open.spotify.com/track/3SIgBSv9D8Nm3CvP0o0Q9Z)" from the
album "[Watch the
Throne](https://open.spotify.com/album/2P2Xwvh2xWXIZ1OWY9S9o5)," in
which he and Kanye West both address verses to their future sons. In
Jay's verse, he raps: "Took me 26 years just to find my path / My only
job is cut the time in half." (Jay-Z's son, Sir, and his twin sister,
Rumi, [were born last
June](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/14/arts/music/beyonce-twins-photo.html).
His eldest daughter, Blue Ivy, is 5.)

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Do you worry at all that as much as you will teach
them history, and as much as you yourself are seen as an important
figure among black people in America, that there's something they'll be
missing? Or do you think that's silly, \[that\] in fact they'll have so
many advantages that that's too negative of a way to approach it?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Exactly. Like, they'll be who they are, right? And
it's just certain tools that you would hope for your child to have. You
know, like, again, fairness and compassion and empathy and a loving
heart. And those things translate in any environment. Those are the main
base things that you want — well, for me, I would want my child to have.
You know? Treat people as they are, no matter who they are, no matter
where they sit in the world, not to, like, be super nice to someone at a
high position or mean to someone who they've deemed to be below them. I
can't buy you love, I can't show it to you. I can show you affection and
I can, you know, I can express love, but I can't put it in your hand. I
can't put compassion in your hand. I can't show you that. So the most
beautiful things are things that are invisible. That's where the
important things lie.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> For me as a black man of a certain age, when I was a
kid O.J. Simpson was God. I'm 61, so I was a little kid when he was
\[around\]. Do you expect black people and white people and young people
and old people to hear different things in your music? I'm sure I heard
some things in that song that you may not even have thought of 'cause
I'm a different generation. What do you want a young white kid to hear
in that song that maybe a young black kid would not
hear?

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> That's a great question. I think when you make music,
you want people to hear different things, and then you want it to start
a dialogue. Because that's how we get to understanding. "Oh, you felt
that way about it." "This is actually what I meant, because this
happened, and these things happened, that led to me saying this specific
thing."

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> How did you react when that one line in that song
where you referred to Jews and wealth<sup>2</sup> \["You ever wonder why
Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it"\] —
some people got upset. How did you feel about
that?

<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>2</sup>Reggie Ugwu:</span> A
representative of the Anti-Defamation League [told Rolling
Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/adl-rebukes-jay-z-over-jewish-lyric-in-the-story-of-oj-w491217),
"the lyric does seem to play into deep-seated anti-Semitic stereotypes
about Jews and money."

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> I felt it was really hypocritical. Only because it's
obvious the song is, like, "Do you want to be rich? Do what people got
rich done." Of course, it's a general statement, right? It's obviously a
general statement, like the video attached to it was a general
statement. And if you didn't have a problem with the general statement I
made about black people, and people eating watermelon and things like
that \[[the animated music
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0) for the song, which
references racist cartoons, includes a caricature of a black man eating
watermelon\] — if *that* was fine, \[but\] that line about wealth
bothered you, then that's very hypocritical, and, you know, that's
something within yourself. 'Cause basically, I was saying, you know,
Michael Jordan, LeBron James, is a great basketball player. He trains in
the off-season. If you want to be great, train in off-season like him.
That's basically the statement. You can't miss the context of the song.
You have to be like 5 years old or something.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Some people think that the election of Donald Trump
has revived the debate about race in America. Some people think that, in
fact, there's always been racism in America; that it hasn't changed and
that the debate isn't any different. It's just people are paying
attention to it. What do you think?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Yeah, there was a great Kanye West line in one of
\[his\] songs: "Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it."
\["[Never Let Me
Down](https://open.spotify.com/track/06TqBu4Vi2DEu2F2wNTEnb)," from
West's 2004 album, "[The College
Dropout](https://open.spotify.com/album/3ff2p3LnR6V7m6BinwhNaQ)."\] Take
a step back. I think when Donald Sterling<sup>3</sup> got kicked out of
the N.B.A., I thought it was a misstep, because when you kick someone
out, of course he's done wrong, right? But you also send everyone else
back in hiding. People talk like that. They talk like that. Let's deal
with
that.

<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>3</sup>Reggie Ugwu:</span> In 2014,
Sterling, then owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was [banned for
life](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/04/30/sports/basketball/nba-donald-sterling-los-angeles-clippers.html)
from the N.B.A. after a recording emerged in which he made racist
comments about black people to a female friend.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I wouldn’t just, like, leave him alone. It should have been some sort of
penalties. He could have lost some draft picks. But getting rid of him
just made everyone else go back into hiding, and now we can’t have the
dialogue. The great thing about Donald Trump being president is now
we’re forced to have the dialogue. Now we’re having the conversation
on the large scale; he’s provided the platform for us to have the
conversation.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> And you think that's better? That we should be
having a conversation?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Absolutely. That's why this is happening.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Do you think the debate over race in America is
happening in a healthy way?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Well, an ideal way is to have a president that says,
"I'm open to dialogue and fixing this." That's ideal. But it's still
happening in a good way, because you can't have a solution until you
start dealing with the problem: What you reveal, you heal.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Right? If I have like a tumor, and I don't know it,
it doesn't mean it goes away. I have to diagnose it first. No matter how
it happens. If I get hit with a football, and, like, Oh, I feel
something there, and then I go to the doctor — it still happened.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Right.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> You know what I'm saying? So however it happens,
we're just getting hit with a lot of footballs. To use \[an\] analogy
that goes next to the N.F.L.

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> If you were an owner, you would sign [Colin

<div class="g-item g-text">

</div>

<div class="g-annotation-body">

<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>4</sup>Wesley Morris:</span> Ah,
Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, whose
protest against racism and racial inequality in America might be the
most incendiary act of political umbrage since [Kanye West
declared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIUzLpO1kxI), at a 2005
national telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina, that George W. Bush
"doesn't care about black people." Kaepernick's decision last year to
take a knee during the performance of the national anthem has since been
adopted by dozens of other athletes. The president's outrage at the
protests and the ensuing debate have upstaged the injustice Kaepernick
knelt against. In October, after several months without being signed to
a team, [Kaepernick
filed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/15/sports/colin-kaepernick-nfl-collusion.html)
a grievance against the N.F.L. accusing the owners of collusion against
him. So there's an apt sting in dedicating "The Story of O.J." to him,
since he's now taking a hit for being agreeable, race-blind O.J.
Simpson's opposite.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Have you met him?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> No. We just had dialogue over the phone, but we
supposed to get together.

he would be signed by a team?

<span>JAY-Z</span> Yeah, yeah. Of course.

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Do you think basketball is more politically active
than football?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Yeah.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Why is that?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> I think because, first of all, it's smaller numbers.
It's 12 people on a team. In football you have 53 people. So it's harder
to get 53 people thinking the same thing. It's easier to have a
conversation to get 12 people on the same page. For one. Two, \[the
N.B.A. has\] a great ... they have a great commissioner<sup>5</sup>
who's really open. And, you know, supports them. And you feel that. You
feel like, you know, when you have someone behind you that really
believe in what's right, it motivates you to do the right thing. I think
those two factors show why they're much further
along.

Silver is the current, generally beloved N.B.A. commissioner. He has yet
to drastically stifle expressions of political empathy by teams or
individual players. (Let's see what happens should a player defy his
expectation that all N.B.A. players [stand during the
anthem](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/28/sports/basketball/nba-adam-silver-anthem.html).)
Silver has merrily ridden for the last two years on the N.B.A. float in
New York City's gay pride parade. He oversaw the expulsion of the Los
Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who could never have remained in
the league — his continued presence might have torn it apart. Ridding
basketball of Sterling started as many conversations about the sort of
open-carry racism we're currently living with as keeping him around
would have. One thing that makes Silver a great commissioner is that he
understands that.

<span>BAQUET</span> First off, how does Jay-Z find a therapist? Not in
the Phone book, right?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> No, through great friends of mine. You know. Friends
of mine who've been through a lot and, you know, come out on the other
side as, like, whole individuals.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> What was that like, being in therapy? What did you
talk about that you had never acknowledged to yourself or talked about?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> I grew so much from the experience. But I think the
most important thing I got is that everything is connected. Every
emotion is connected and it comes from somewhere. And just being aware
of it. Being aware of it in everyday life puts you at such a ... you're
at such an advantage. You know, you realize that if someone's racist
toward you, it ain't about you. It's about their upbringing and what
happened to them, and how that led them to this point. You know, most
bullies bully. It just happen. Oh, you got bullied as a kid so you
trying to bully me. I understand.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

And once I understand that, instead of reacting to that with anger, I
can provide a softer landing and maybe, “Aw, man, is you O.K.?” I was
just saying there was a lot of fights in our neighborhood that started
with “What you looking at? Why you looking at me? You looking at me?”
And then you realize: “Oh, you think I see you. You’re in this space
where you’re hurting, and you think I see you, so you don’t want me to
look at you. And you don’t want me to see you.”

you put on this shell of this tough person that's really willing to
fight me and possibly kill me 'cause I looked at you. You know what I'm
saying, like, so ... Knowing that and understanding that changes life
completely.

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Was that a moment that came from therapy?

<span>JAY-Z</span> You have to survive. So you go into survival mode,
and when you go into survival mode what happen? You shut down all
emotions. So even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you
can't connect.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> You can't connect because of the way you feel about
yourself, you mean?

the things happen from there: infidelity ...

<span>BAQUET</span> You've bared your soul so much. Not only in this
album — you can sort of see the evolution of a person in your music.
Part of me would think, Oh my god, I gotta talk about my marriage, I
gotta talk about my mother, I gotta talk about my other ancestors. Part
of me would think that would make me nuts. Does it make you nuts, or do
you feel like the heart of your art is to tell the story of your life?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> That's who I — that's who I am. And I've done it from
the beginning of my career. Two things: one, no one knew the characters
\[back then\]. So it wasn't as impactful. And two, it wasn't coming from
a place where it was as evolved.<sup>8</sup> And it's very difficult.
It's hard to hear songs back. It's hard to perform ... songs, but, um, I
feel it's the most important work that I've done and I'm very proud of
it and the effect that it's having on people. Even like the studio
sessions, you know, we were having four-hour conversations after playing
one song. I learned so much about people that was around me, just my
friends, I learned things about them that I didn't know, in a 20-year
relationship, just from this one song. So I knew it would have that sort
of impact beyond myself. It's my responsibility as an artist to go to
these
places.

admiring his wealth and wielding it. Being a rich black rapper had put
him on the defensive when his strongest creative mode involves the moral

The strongest thing a man can do is cry. To expose your feelings, to be

<span>BAQUET</span> As a parent, I thought one of the most painful
scenes in the album was when you are talking about having almost lost
your marriage, and what it would have been like to watch another man
play football with your kid. Given that you have talked so much about
your life in your music, are there things that you put a wall around?
You've talked about the pain of growing up where you grew up, how you
grew up, your father leaving early, the pain of your marriage, being in
therapy: Are there things \[about which\] you say, "I'm not going
there"?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Yeah. And it mostly involves other people 'cause when
other people are involved, you may be ready to expose these things,

<div class="g-annotation-body">

<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>11</sup>Wesley Morris:</span> I'm a
sucker for mommy music. The third track on "4:44" — "Smile" — features
Jay-Z's mother, Gloria Carter, and contains this couplet about her:
"Momma had four kids, but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long that
she's a thespian." His rapping here is buttery and exuberant: "I just
wanna see you smile through all the hate / Marie Antoinette, baby, let
'em eat cake." So his approach to Gloria manages to exult her and, for
anybody annoyed by his "eat the cake, Anna Mae" line on Beyoncé's 2013
track "[Drunk in
Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/6jG2YzhxptolDzLHTGLt7S)," arguably
to exonerate him from having cast himself as Ike Turner to Beyoncé's
Tina. Anyway, "Smile" ends with an inspirational poem that Gloria wrote
and recites and that puts the concept of shadows to moving metaphorical
use: "The world is changing and they say it's time to be free / But you
live with the fear of just being me / Living in the shadow feels like
the safe place to be / No harm for them, no harm for me / But life is
short, and it's time to be free / Love who you love, because life isn't
guaranteed / Smile."

<span>JAY-Z</span> Not, no, not — let's call it teenage years.

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> So you realized that and talked to her about it?

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> But we never spoke about it. Until, like, recently,
now we start having these beautiful conversations, and just really
getting to know each other. We were always good friends but now we're
really great friends. You know. And we were just talking as friends. And
then she was sharing that she was in love. She can be herself \[now\].
She doesn't have to hide for her kids or feel like she's embarrassing
her kids. It was a much different time then. \[Now\] she can just live
her full life, her whole life, and be her.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Will this get harder over time? Like, you know, as a
young man, your music was the way a lot of young rappers are — it's
like, you know, \[your music was about\] the violent life. If that's
chapter one of the autobiography, chapter two of the autobiography — I'm
oversimplifying — is like, "Now I'm really rich. I have a lot of stuff.
Let me tell you how cool that is." And then chapter three of the
autobiography is, "Oh my god, I've run myself into the ground." So
what's chapter four?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> No, chapter three is: Oh my goodness, oh, the most
beautiful things are not these objects. The most beautiful things are
inside. The most beautiful things are the friendships I have. I have
really golden friendships. The compassion and the person I've become —
that's what this chapter is. You know? And the conversation with my mom.
Those are the real enriching experiences.

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> But will you have the same adventures in your life?
Will you have the same stuff to write about? Or maybe you don't know.

long time. But still, no, I don't think people are looking to me as

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Is that hard to deal with, or did you feel like, I'm
O.K. with that, because I've moved on?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> No.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> You don't want to be.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> 'Cause I, at the end of the day we gonna find out
it's not about the white-hot space, but it's about finding the truth.
That white-hot space — people think it's the biggest thing, but it's
really small. It's almost like a trend.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Would you rather be a trend, or you rather be Ralph Lauren? You know
what I mean; like, you rather be a trend, or you rather be forever?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I’m the person that looked at the Mona Lisa and be like, Man, that’s
gonna be cool in 40 years. I play forever. And so my whole thing is to
identify with the truth. Not to be the youngest, hottest, new, trendy
thing.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> One of the things you rap about also is the pain you
caused the people you sold drugs to.<sup>12</sup> Have you ever had
conversations with people like that you caused pain to as a young man
and talked about
it?

<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>12</sup>Reggie Ugwu:</span> A motif
of Jay-Z's discography is the mutually assured destruction of drug users
and drug dealers alike. From "[Can I
Live](https://open.spotify.com/track/0qSfuaTaSacJfsNqXZPbkX)" on 1996's
"[Reasonable
Doubt](https://open.spotify.com/album/5lheTytGmdGaGlxzXu4uDY)": "We
hustle out of a sense of hopelessness ... We become addicted / Sort of
like the fiends we accustomed to servin'."

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> No, I haven't. No.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> What would you say to them? Or is that impossible to
do at this point?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Nothing's impossible. I guess that conversation would
definitely take ownership for my part in, um, you know, the part I
played in occupying that space. Because knowing what I know now, you
know, you can't sacrifice others for your life. There's a karmic debt
that has to be paid. Had I had the level of consciousness then that I
have now, things would have turned out differently. And just knowing
that ... I definitely want everyone to know that.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Do black artists have a different obligation than
white artists? Do you feel you have a different kind of obligation to
the people who listen to you than if you were a white musician?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Yeah, 'cause I have an obligation, [going back
to](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2016/02/01/arts/television/oj-simpson-murder-trial-coverage.html)
the story of O.J., [to further
conversation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/11/17/opinion/jay-z-meek-mill-probation.html)
of an entire race of people. And to . . . Not me — all of us. But
specifically me, since you're asking the question, it's to open up
dialogue. \[...\] It's O.K. to think. It's O.K. to be smart. You know,
there was a time when people was like, "you talkin' white." It's like,
what does that even mean? I know words? Intelligence is not a tribute to
color. And I'm sure you've heard it growing up many times.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Of course.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> "You speaking white." Like, what?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Yeah. Yeah.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> I'm speaking like I know words. And it's O.K., it's
fine. You know, so I have an obligation to further the conversation and
always, you know, our stature in America. Our emotional maturity. And so
on and so forth. It's humbling; at the same time it's like, you know,
it's what you've been charged with in life. And I believe since the
beginning of time the poets have been charged with that. Like it was the
poets that's explaining the emotions and making these songs that people
like, "Oh, that's what I feel."

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Are there black artists, and I won't ask you to name
them unless you want to, who you think don't live up to that obligation
to start a conversation about race? Do you think there are people you
wish did more?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Well, I mean, and for one, O.J., right? 'Cause that's
the one that we can all identify. There are those who don't uphold their
mantle, and we know how that story plays out.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> What would you say to him if you could talk to him?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> I don't know. I would probably say, "Man, I'm sorry
that so much happened to you, man." You know, people act out in this way
based on their life experiences and, you know, I'm sure he's been
through a lot of trauma in his life. I think that'll start the
conversation.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Did you watch the documentary about him?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> I watched every one.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> I did too.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Yeah, there was like [eight of them
on](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/06/26/arts/television/oj-simpson-trial-made-in-america.html)
at the same time.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> You could read the story of O.J. two ways. You could
say it's a reminder of people that they're black. I could read that as a
negative message or a positive message. The positive message being:
You're black and you should be more proud of it. The negative message
is: Who are you kidding? You can't escape this by joining a private
country club and playing golf.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Right.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Which message feels like the right \[one\]?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> They both, they both dual messages at the same time.
It's like, be proud of who you are and realize that we're gonna get
further together. Don't check out. You can't just turn your back on the
place you come from. You come from a community. Your job is to uplift it
now.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> So now I gotta ask my one gossipy question. Talk
about Kanye West and your relationship with him, which you alluded to a
little bit in the album.<sup>13</sup> When's the last time you talked to
him?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-annotation">

<div class="g-annotation-portrait" style="background-image: url(https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2017/10/30/jayz/27fad94c678e831a0fb514ffbcdcda96925ebdcb/wesley_morris.jpg);">

</div>

<div class="g-annotation-body">

<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>13</sup>Wesley Morris:</span> It's
an allusion to a saga. Together, Jay-Z and Kanye West made the 2011
album "Watch the Throne," which reached an apogee of rap collaboration.
The story goes that last year, Jay-Z, through his partnership with Live
Nation, gave West $20 million as part of his contract to cover expenses
for his Saint Pablo tour. Then, from the stage of that tour in
Sacramento, West embarked on a tirade that included shots at, among
others, Beyoncé, Mark Zuckerberg and, yes, Jay-Z: "I've been sent here
to give y'all my truth even at the risk of my own life, even at the risk
of my own success, my own career. ... Jay-Z — call me, brah. You still
ain't called me. ... Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send
'em at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man." He eventually
ended the concert after four songs and, two days later, [checked himself
into a
hospital](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/21/arts/music/kanye-west-hospitalized-exhaustion.html)
for an eight-day stay. So, in response, Jay-Z opens "4:44" with "[Kill
Jay-Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQLVU4j7Ejo)," nearly three
minutes of second-person self-laceration. "You ain't a saint / This
ain't KumbaYe," Jay-Z raps. "But you got hurt because you did cool by Ye
/ You gave him $20 without blinking / He gave you 20 minutes on stage /
\[What\] was he thinkin'?" I've been interpreting this as Jay-Z
realizing the usefulness of the old business credo advising against
mixing business with friendship and blaming himself for ignoring it.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> I \[talked to\] Kanye the other day, just to tell
him, like, he's my brother. I love Kanye. I do. It's a complicated
relationship with us.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Why is it complicated?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> 'Cause, you know — Kanye came into this business on
my label. So I've always been like his big brother. And we're both
entertainers. It's always been like a little underlying competition with
your big brother. And we both love and respect each other's art, too. So
it's like, we both — everyone wants to be the greatest in the world. You
know what I'm saying? And then there's like a lot of other factors that
play in it. But it's gonna, we gonna always be good.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> But there's tension now, right?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that happens. In the long
relationship, you know, hopefully when we're 89 we look at this six
months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I'm saying?
There's gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get
through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a
dialogue and say, "These are the things that I'm uncomfortable with.
These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel."
I'm sure he feels that I've done things to him as well. You know what
I'm saying? These are — I'm not a perfect human being by no stretch. You
know.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Is he as evolved as you?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> He's highly evolved. No, he's ... I think he started
out in a more compassionate position than me. You know what I'm saying.
I don't know if he's had the level of — I mean, I had to survive by my
instincts. I'm here because I grew up a different way. And I got out of
that.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

You know, my first album came out when I was 26. So I was already a
different artist. You know, a lot of people's album come out they're 17,
18. So their subject matter is that of a 17- or 18-year-old. Unless
you're [Nas](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/topic/person/nas), and
you like, well-read<sup>14</sup>... — like, he was way more advanced
with the album that he wrote. So I just grew up a different way. But
\[West is\] a very compassionate person. And a lot of times he get in
trouble trying to help others. So I can identify with it. It's just that
there's certain things that happened that's not really acceptable to
me.

<div class="g-annotation-body">

<span class="g-annotation-name"><sup>14</sup>Reggie Ugwu:</span>
Recorded when he was still a teenager, Nas's landmark 1994 debut album,
"Illmatic," was praised for its vivid, incisive lyrics about coming of
age among urban blight. A Queens native and autodidact, he dropped out
of school after the eighth grade.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Right.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> And we just need to speak about it. But there's
genuine love there.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> I'm trying to picture the scene when you and your
wife both talked about making these very confessional, open albums. Was
it difficult to say: "I'm gonna talk about the problems in our marriage.
I'm gonna talk about how we almost lost things." And for her to say:
"I'm gonna talk about my pain and anger at you." What were those
conversations like?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Again, it didn't — it didn't happen in that way. It
happened — we were using our art almost like a therapy session. And we
started making music together.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

And then the [music she was
making](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/04/25/arts/music/beyonce-unearths-pain-and-lets-it-flow-in-lemonade.html)
at that time was further along. So her album came out as opposed to the
joint album that we were working on. Um, we still have a lot of that
music. And this is what it became. There was never a point where it was
like, “I’m making this album.” I was right there the entire time.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> And what was her reaction to your work and what was
your reaction to hers? They must have caused pain for each of you,
right?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> Of course. And both very, very uncomfortable, but
\[...\] the best place in the, you know, hurricane is like in the middle
of it.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Yeah.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> We were sitting in the eye of that hurricane. Uh,
maybe not use hurricane because so many people are being affected right
now. \[This interview took place nine days after [Hurricane
Maria](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/21/us/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico.html)

hurricanes,
[Irma](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/09/07/us/irma-florida-coverage.html)
and
[Harvey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/28/us/hurricane-harvey-texas.html),
that struck the U.S. mainland.\]

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Yeah.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> But the best place is right in the middle of the
pain.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Right.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> And that's where we were sitting. And it was
uncomfortable. And we had a lot of conversations. You know. \[I was\]
really proud of the music she made, and she was really proud of the art
I released. And, you know, at the end of the day we really have a
healthy respect for one another's craft. I think she's amazing.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

You know, most people walk away, and like divorce rate is like 50
percent or something ’cause most people can’t see themselves. The
hardest thing is seeing pain on someone’s face that you caused, and then
have to deal with yourself.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Yeah.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> So, you know, most people don't want to do that. You
don't want to look inside yourself.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>BAQUET</span> Yeah.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

<span>JAY-Z</span> And so you walk away.
