Thomas B. Modly, the acting Navy secretary,
[resigned](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/us/politics/coronavirus-navy-captain-firing.html)
after he was criticized for his response to an outbreak of the novel
coronavirus aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.

On the same day, Kayleigh McEnany was announced as the White House press
secretary, replacing Stephanie Grisham, who [is rejoining the staff of
Melania
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/us/politics/kayleigh-mcenany-stephanie-grisham-trump.html),
the first lady — the latest shake-up in a communications office that has
seen almost constant turnover under President Trump. It is not yet clear
if there will be a replacement for Ms. Grisham’s role as communications
chief.

Mr. Trump has the record for White House and cabinet churn in a
president’s first term, according to Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a scholar at
the Brookings Institution who wrote a [presidential staff turnover
study](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/).

Some roles have been more volatile than
others.

“The disruption is highly consequential,” Max Stier, the president and
chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit
organization that specializes in federal government management issues.
“When you lose a leader, it has a cascade effect throughout the
organization.”

A New York Times analysis of 21 top White House and cabinet positions
back to President Bill Clinton’s first term shows how unusual the Trump
administration’s upheaval was through the first 14 months of a
presidency. Nine of these positions had turned over at least once during
the Trump administration, compared with three at the same point of the
Clinton administration, two under President Barack Obama and one under
President George W. Bush.

On several occasions, Mr. Trump has filled newly open positions with
officials already in his administration. He chose Mike Pompeo, the
C.I.A. director, to replace Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, and Mr.
Pompeo’s deputy, Gina Haspel, to replace Mr. Pompeo. Hope Hicks, a
longtime aide and confidant, took over communications after Mr.
Scaramucci’s disastrous tenure. And Kirstjen Nielsen crisscrossed from
the Department of Homeland Security to the White House and then back
again (before leaving the administration).

“There’s a pull to fill from within, but that’s often a bad idea,” Mr.
Stier said. “Not only does it create a new vacancy but you’re also not
expanding the talent pool. One of the primary leadership challenges is
getting information from outside the bubble you exist
in.”
