Lauryn Hill was 22 years old, pregnant with her first child and had two
albums with the Fugees under her belt when she started writing the songs
that would become her 1998 solo debut. ``The Miseducation of Lauryn
Hill,'' a personal LP that touched on relationships, neighborhood, faith
and pride, arrived with a bang: a chart record for first-week sales by a
female artist. It went on to sell 8 million copies in the United States,
earn five Grammys and become the defining artistic statement of the
year, as well as of Hill's career.

The first sound on the album is a school bell calling a classroom to
order, followed by a teacher taking attendance and conducting a loose
forum about the nature of love. The conversations, which appeared in
interludes throughout the album, took place with a class populated by
neighborhood children and an educator, Ras Baraka, who went on to become
the mayor of Newark.

As the album celebrated its 20th anniversary this year, Ike
Sriskandarajah, a producer for The New York Times podcast ``The Daily,''
set out to track down as many of the featured children as possible. They
spoke about how their ideas about love shifted over the years, Hill's
landmark album and the hometown they call New Jerusalem.
