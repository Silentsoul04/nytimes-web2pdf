Pacific Gas & Electric, California’s largest utility, has been
responsible for wildfires in recent years that destroyed hundreds of
thousands of acres. Several proved deadly.

</div>

<div class="g-steps">

<div class="g-item g-text g-step g-first" data-step="0">

One of the biggest fires started near Sacramento in 2015, when a tree
that PG\&E had failed to maintain hit one of its power lines.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text g-step" data-step="1">

The fire covered more than 70,000 acres. Two people died.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text g-step" data-step="2">

In 2017, four fires erupted in the Napa area when trees hit PG\&E power
lines in several locations.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text g-step" data-step="3">

Some of those fires fed into others. In total, more than 100,000 acres
and 1,475 structures burned.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text g-step" data-step="4">

Last year, near Paradise, a live wire broke free of a tower that was a
quarter-century past what PG\&E considers its “useful life.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text g-step" data-step="5">

What followed destroyed nearly 14,000 homes and killed 85 people. It was
the most destructive wildfire in California history.

</div>

<div class="g-step g-last">

<div class="g-item g-moved-hed">

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Tower 27/222 looms almost 100 feet tall in the Sierra Nevada foothills,
a hunk of steel that has endured through 18 United States presidents.
The transmission lines that it supports keep electricity flowing to much
of California.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

On the morning of Nov. 8, a live wire broke free of its grip. A power
failure occurred on the line, affecting a single customer. But 15
minutes later, a fire was observed nearby. Within hours, flames engulfed
the region, ultimately killing 85 and destroying the town of Paradise.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The equipment belonged to the state’s biggest utility, Pacific Gas and
Electric. To the company’s critics, the tower and its vulnerability
reflect a broken safety culture.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Five of the 10 [most destructive
fires](http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/downloads/fact_sheets/Top20_Destruction.pdf)
in California since 2015 have been linked to PG\&E’s electrical network.
Regulators have found that in many fires, PG\&E violated state law or
could have done more to make its equipment safer.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Long before the failure suspected in the Paradise fire, a company email
had noted that some of PG\&E’s structures in the area, known for fierce
winds, were at risk of collapse. It reported corrosion of one tower so
severe that it endangered crews trying to repair the tower. The
company’s own guidelines put Tower 27/222 a quarter-century beyond its
useful life — but the tower
remained.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In January, the company sought bankruptcy protection, saying it might
face more than $30 billion in wildfire liabilities. Its financial
straits could hamper its preparations for the next wildfire season, and
those beyond, even as weather patterns increase the fire risk.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“There is a climate change component to this,” said Michael W. Wara,
director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University
and a member of a state commission examining the cost of wildfires. “But
there’s also a failure of management and a failure of vision.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Another major utility in the state, San Diego Gas & Electric, has added
hundreds of weather stations, cameras and satellite technology in recent
years to reduce fire risk. PG\&E is now trying to catch up.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Beyond wildfires, PG\&E has a broader history of safety problems. A 2010
explosion of a PG\&E gas pipeline killed eight people and destroyed a
suburban neighborhood, prompting state and federal officials to
investigate PG\&E’s safety practices. Regulators ultimately fined the
utility $1.6 billion, and a federal jury convicted it of violating a
pipeline safety law and obstructing an investigation. The company is
still under court-supervised probation.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

PG\&E executives acknowledge that the company has made mistakes. “We
have heard the calls for change and are committed to taking action by
focusing our resources on reducing risk and improving safety throughout
our system,” John Simon, PG\&E’s interim chief executive, said in a
recent statement.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But Gov. Gavin Newsom said the company’s record made it hard to take its
promises seriously.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“They have simply been caught red-handed over and over again, lying,
manipulating or misleading the public,” Mr. Newsom said in an interview.
“They cannot be
trusted.”

Iris Natividad and her partner of 28 years, Andrew Downer, had spent a
decade in a Paradise home, where they had an antiques business and Mr.
Downer’s 80,000-piece antique marble collection. Ms. Natividad was away
when Mr. Downer told her by phone that a fire had been sighted in the
town of Pulga and was headed his way.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Pulga seemed distant enough — about a 20-minute drive — that there would
be time to escape if necessary. But 30 minutes later, the flames were a
mile away, and there was no one to evacuate Mr. Downer, a 54-year-old
amputee.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“He told me, ‘Today might be a good day to die,’” Ms. Natividad
recalled. Mr. Downer and his service dog, a Labrador, were killed.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The state has not finished its investigation of the blaze, known as the
Camp Fire, which became California’s deadliest ever. But the company
said recently that its equipment was probably the cause. And utility
experts were incredulous that PG\&E had let Tower 27/222 stand for so
long. The company’s critics say the utility could have easily obtained
approval from state regulators to replace the tower and recover the cost
from ratepayers.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“Some people believe that you run equipment to failure,” Catherine
Sandoval, a former California regulator who has been pushing for
improved maintenance of electrical poles and towers. “They believe ‘run
to failure’ to save money. This is the danger of run to failure.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In December 2012, five other aging towers on the same stretch, the
Caribou-Palermo line, collapsed in a storm. In July 2013, Brian Cherry,
PG\&E’s vice president for regulatory affairs at the time, notified
state regulators that the company would replace the five fallen towers
and one more, but not 27/222.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

A 2014 company email that has come to light in the bankruptcy
proceedings said that “the likelihood of failed structures happening is
high.” But PG\&E determined that if the structures failed, the cause
would probably be heavy rain, precluding a wildfire risk. PG\&E said
this week that the structures in question were temporary wooden poles
that had since been replaced.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In April 2016, PG\&E made another request to regulators: to install
fresh wires on the Caribou-Palermo line. But the company said it would
not replace any of the line’s remaining nearly century-old towers.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

That October, during painting work on a lattice tower on the line, a
piece of hardware called a J hook broke when a contract worker grabbed
it while repositioning himself. A PG\&E report said workers had
determined that corrosion — the reason for the painting — was enough of
a problem that “crews working on these towers need to use caution.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The company said that tower had a different design from Tower 27/222’s.
But it would not comment on why it didn’t replace 27/222 given its age.
It said it considered many factors when making decisions on maintenance
and
repairs.

## ‘A focus on the bottom line over everything’

suburb killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood.</span>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The deadly 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, a San Francisco
suburb, was PG\&E’s second in a two-year period. The ensuing
investigations and litigation produced an alarming picture of the
company’s practices and priorities.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In court depositions, employees said supervisors routinely ignored their
concerns about the company’s use of faulty analysis and outdated
equipment. The state’s Public Utilities Commission, which regulates
PG\&E, concluded that the company was more concerned with profit than
with safety.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The commission’s [safety and enforcement division
found](http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/uploadedFiles/CPUC_Public_Website/Content/Safety/Natural_Gas_Pipeline/News/AgendaStaffReportreOIIPGESanBrunoExplosion.pdf)
in 2012 that PG\&E’s gas and transmission revenues exceeded what it was
authorized to collect by $224 million in the decade leading up to the
explosion. But capital spending fell $93 million short of its authorized
budget between 1997 and 2000. PG\&E also spent millions less on
operations and maintenance than it was supposed to.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“There was very much a focus on the bottom line over everything: ‘What
are the earnings we can report this quarter?’” said Mike Florio, a
utilities commissioner from 2011 through 2016. “And things really got
squeezed on the maintenance side.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Five years after the explosion, a PG\&E line started the Butte Fire,
which scorched more than 70,000 acres, killing two people and destroying
nearly a thousand homes and other buildings.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

State investigators said workers should have known that when they had
cleared a stand of trees for PG\&E, they had exposed a gray pine weak
enough to be blown into a power line. On Sept. 9, 2015, strong winds
knocked that tree into the line, igniting the fire.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

State officials also blamed PG\&E equipment for starting 17 of 21 major
fires in 2017 that ripped through Northern California, including
wine-growing Napa and Sonoma Counties.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

A [2017
report](http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M235/K399/235399881.PDF)
commissioned by state regulators determined that PG\&E often made
improvements only after a disaster. The report, which was produced by
NorthStar Consulting, also found that the transmission and distribution
side of the company had less robust safety policies than its gas and
power generation
divisions.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-subhed">

## Bonuses were linked to reducing fallen wires, but the policy didn’t last

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Under regulatory and legal pressure after the San Bruno gas explosion,
PG\&E took steps to elevate safety as a priority. In 2012, the company
started linking a portion of executives’ annual bonuses to minimizing
the number of downed power lines.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But after the company reported that the number of wires down had jumped
nearly 30 percent in 2016, it stopped using that measure to help
calculate bonuses.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

PG\&E started using a benchmark that tracked vegetation-management
efforts as well as inspections and upgrades of electrical lines. The
company said the new statistic helped reduce the number of fallen wires.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The change came as PG\&E installed a new chief executive, Geisha J.
Williams, formerly head of the company’s electric operations. Weeks
later, in May 2017, the company approved a dividend increase, the second
in just over a year, that helped win investors’ favor.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

After the devastating wildfires of October 2017, Ms. Williams detailed
steps the company was taking to prevent more fires, like disabling power
lines when the risk of fires was high and improving how it dealt with
foliage near its lines.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But Ms. Williams also said the company was often being blamed for fires
when it had done nothing wrong. She took aim at a California legal
principle that held companies liable for the damage caused by their
equipment even when the businesses had not acted negligently, and said
PG\&E was pushing regulators, lawmakers and courts to change the
provision. At an industry conference last March, she said doing so was
“the most important thing for us right now.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

While the company did not get everything it wanted, the California
Legislature passed a law in September that allowed utilities to recoup
some of the cost of wildfire liabilities by raising electricity rates.
But that law did not address 2018 wildfires, leaving the company
responsible for tens of billions of dollars in damage.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

In January, with a bankruptcy filing imminent, Ms. Williams left the
company. She did not respond to requests for comment for this
article.

## After its own fire disaster, another utility became a safety innovator

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

State officials say there is a good template elsewhere in California for
what PG\&E should be aiming for: the practices of San Diego Gas &
Electric.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The San Diego utility keeps data on every utility pole and transmission
tower in its service territory, which is smaller than PG\&E’s but has a
higher proportion of overhead lines in areas at high fire risk. It uses
nearly 177 stations to monitor temperature, humidity and wind speeds in
an area roughly the size of Connecticut and records video from 100
high-definition cameras. It uses satellites to track how green or dry
the grass is and employs the state’s largest water-dropping helicopter
to douse fires quickly. When data indicates a high wildfire threat, the
utility cuts off power to some areas.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

San Diego Gas & Electric upgraded its fire-prevention efforts after
residents sued it for causing a devastating wildfire in 2007. In recent
years, it has been responsible for far fewer fires than PG\&E. “We want
to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to mitigate ignition,”
said Scott Drury, the utility’s president.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Sumeet Singh, PG\&E’s vice president for community wildfire safety, said
in an interview that the utility was putting new safety policies in
place, often using San Diego’s approach. They include ground and
helicopter inspections of poles and towers, and weather monitoring
systems.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But he suggested that PG\&E had an uphill task given climate change. He
said equipment failures that would have caused little or no damage a few
years ago now set off fires that burn thousands of acres because
California forests had become much more combustible.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The risk of wildfires in California has clearly gone up, but Robert
McCullough, a longtime consultant to energy companies and state and
federal officials investigating them, said there would have been far
fewer destructive fires had PG\&E followed San Diego’s lead years ago.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

“Their culture of a lack of safety is unique, in my opinion,” he said.
