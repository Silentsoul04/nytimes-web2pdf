<span class="dropcap">E</span>arl Rose, 72, plays the piano three nights
a week at Bemelmans Bar in the Carlyle Hotel, on New York’s Upper East
Side. The Carlyle, and Bemelmans in particular, with its gold-leaf
ceiling, white-liveried wait staff and faded murals by the “Madeline”
illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans, is one of those New York time capsules
that haven’t been preserved solely for tourists. Locals find special
comfort in such brazen defiance of the natural life cycle of the city,
of the churn that’s coming for us all. The very presence of Rose, who
has played at Bemelmans for 24 years, has become a part of the
anachronistic charm. He wouldn’t have been an unusual sight in the
Manhattan of even recent memory. The Plaza, the St. Regis, the
Sherry-Netherland, the Grand Hyatt, the Ritz-Carlton (where Gore Vidal
once berated him for not knowing enough Leonard Bernstein tunes): All
once featured live music, and Rose has played all of those rooms. “It’s
all gone,” Rose told me. “I don’t know when it’ll come
back.”

Rose is a living connection to the era of show business that his
repertoire, drawn largely from the canonic pop and jazz standards that
make up the Great American Songbook, evokes. His father, Irving Rose,
was a vaudeville comedy dancer who later appeared in Irving Berlin
revues at the Music Box Theater on Broadway; his mother, Irene Rose,
traveled the world with her father as part of a circus trapeze act.
Irving was 50 by the time Earl, an only child, was born in 1946. Both of
Earl’s parents had retired from the stage, and Irving had started a
successful truck-rental company. But they still loved to dance, and
starting when Earl was young, they would take him along to their
favorite nightclub, the original Copacabana, at 10 East 60th Street.
Earl was always the only kid in the club. There’s a photograph of him at
the Copa, age 6, perched on Jimmy Durante’s knee. Once Pearl Bailey
pulled him onstage for a dance.

By high school, when his peers’ taste in pianists tended toward the
likes of Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis, Rose and his friends were
hanging around Carnegie Hall after concerts to bug Vladimir Horowitz for
an autograph. In 1956, his parents told him he might want to check out
“The Eddy Duchin Story,” a Hollywood biopic about a once-famous
big-band leader who used to play a few blocks from the Carlyle, at the
old Central Park Casino. “From the time I saw that movie, that was it,”
Rose says. “I knew I wanted to perform and play. No doubt about it.” He
was
10.

He studied classical piano at what was then called the Mannes College of
Music in New York, and while still in school, he landed a job as an NBC
page at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, greeting guests appearing on Johnny
Carson’s “Tonight Show,” which had not yet moved to Los Angeles. (When
I mentioned the sitcom “30 Rock” and its character Kenneth the Page,
Rose stared at me blankly.) In the greenroom, he met heroes like Oscar
Peterson and Earl Hines, and also befriended members of the “Tonight
Show” band, comprising “some of the greatest jazz musicians in New
York,” Rose says, including Clark Terry and Bucky Pizzarelli. They
invited him to gigs after the tapings, and Pizzarelli instructed him not
only to learn a new song every week, but also to learn to play the song
in every key. Rose guesses he must now have thousands of songs in his
head. He still practices every morning, playing classical music (which
informs his interpretations of standards) for two or three hours, either
at Bemelmans or in a practice space at the Steinway showroom in
Midtown.

<div class="rad-diptych" data-id="100000006523236" data-slug="mag-ny-rose-02">

The first night I saw Rose, he played “They Can’t Take That Away From
Me,” “Bewitched” and “All the Way.” The Great American Songbook, he
says, “represents the best of American creativity and popular culture,
one of the major contributions of America to the world.” During the ’80s
and ’90s, Rose divided his time between New York and Los Angeles, but he
resisted settling on the West Coast — in part, he told me, because there
were no decent rooms to play the kind of music he loved. (His agent told
him that pianists who played in hotels in Los Angeles weren’t respected
and wouldn’t get scoring work in Hollywood.) Even while composing for
film and television and co-writing pop songs, Rose has always maintained
regular hotel or restaurant work. He feels strongly that you should be
able to hear the Songbook standards performed live, particularly in the
city where so many of the tunes were first
written.

![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)

Despite the ambient cocktail chatter, Rose manages to fall into a
reverie as he sways above the keys, peering down at his fingers as if he
were shuffling the pieces of an intricate jigsaw puzzle, searching out a
particular fragment of ocean or sky. There’s a grace to what Rose does,
playing these impeccably crafted songs, his own craft operating at the
highest of levels, and somehow both shutting out and responding to the
din of a crowded urban space swirling about him, the bar noise becoming,
you could argue, a necessary part of the music. (Would you really prefer
to hear “Take the A Train” played in the suffocating silence of a
concert hall?) I asked Rose if he had to learn to become somewhat
egoless as a performer. “Well, I don’t think of it that way,” he said.
“I think of myself as winning people over in a more subtle, minimal
way. Keeping the playing so it’s not in their face. But still having
them come to you. And that, to me, is a big achievement, whether it’s in
a concert setting or in here, with people walking in and then maybe
being surprised. The end is the same result: You got
’em.”
