Mekhi Bråtton’s grandma rides the train with him, two hours each way, to

<span class="dropcap">B</span>y 3:20 or so on Thursdays, Mekhi Bratton,
who is 13, is usually pacing around his apartment, waiting on his
grandmother, anxious to catch the A train that leaves at 3:33. They will
transfer from that line to another, which will take them to Upper
Manhattan, where Mekhi will gather with about 10 other young members of
a gospel group, the Sing Harlem Choir, for a weekly performance at Whole
Foods. On his way out, Mekhi grabs a small gym bag, which carries the
red Nike sneakers (size 11) that he wears at performances. Mekhi, who
joined the chorus two years ago, has always looked older than his age,
which is why his mother, a parole officer, won’t let him wear the
sneakers on the train — red is a gang color, and she knows plenty of
trouble starts on the
subway.

Mekhi’s grandmother, Jackie Bratton, avoided the subway for close to a
decade until the day, about two months after Mekhi first joined the
choir, when he almost missed rehearsal because his mother had to work.
Mekhi just looked at his grandmother. “I could not say no to him,”
Jackie said. This was a boy who, as a toddler, sobbed if the family
could not make it to church to hear the choir. Music was his oxygen, and
in his earliest memories, he already knew how to breathe it in and sing
it
out.

So every Thursday, for that performance at Whole Foods, and every Friday
for rehearsal, Jackie makes the subway trek with Mekhi, a trip that
starts in Far Rockaway, takes them past glistening Jamaica Bay and all
across the borough, dropping them at Fulton Street in Brooklyn, where
the next train will lurch north, depositing them, after nearly two hours
of travel, at Harlem-125th Street. On the train, Mekhi seems to make
himself as small as possible, silent, hunching into his phone or dozing
on his grandmother’s shoulder. If any of his fellow passengers did
notice him, they would not guess that he has a superpower — that when he
sings, people nod their heads without knowing it or put down their forks
or pray more deeply.

The Sing Harlem Choir is a select group of singers who all started with
the Gospel for Teens Choir, a program founded by a longtime Harlem
resident, Vy Higginsen, that offers its students free musical
instruction. Before he joined the teen choir, Mekhi sang only at school
and church; he had never ventured even so far as to touch the sand on
the beach that is a five-minute walk from his home. Now he travels all
over the city to perform — to “weird streets,” he said, like Chambers or
37th Street. He was flown to Chicago to sing at a music festival and
went to Central Park to perform, with his fellow singers, as part of a
bluesy wedding chorus in a production of “As You Like It.” Despite the
two-hour subway ride back home to Far Rockaway, he lingers after every
show and every rehearsal, loath to leave his friends from the chorus,
most of them older teenagers and early-20-somethings who look after him
but are also like him, young people who do not know who they would be if
they could not speak in song to others who need the same
language.

On Sundays, he rises at 7 a.m. and starts his day listening to gospel
greats; some Aretha, maybe some Vanessa Bell Armstrong. He might do some
warm-ups — Aaa-eee-iii-oouu-aah — or work on some dance moves in his
bedroom, which is strung with lights, and imagine himself onstage. By
9:30 a.m., he is out the door with his mother, who drives him to Harlem,
to a regular Sunday-brunch gig at Ginny’s Supper Club, a dark room
packed with tourists. At the club, one Sunday in April, the choir
unleashed a mix of classic, up-tempo gospel, rhythm and blues and
virtuoso call-and-response. In one of the last numbers he sang, Mekhi
stepped forward singing, with his tambourine, banging his instrument in
a fast-forward, complicated conversation with the rhythm of the keyboard
and the drums, slamming down his feet in a blur. There is Mekhi when he
is not singing — a boy who covers his mouth with his hand when he
speaks, who looks up from a lowered chin — and then there is the Mekhi
who
sings.

Earlier in the show, when he came to the microphone for his solo, “A
Change Is Gonna Come,” he was all poised composure. “I was booorn by the
river,” he sang. He cut short the second syllable of “river,” as if
giving the audience an extra moment to breathe, to take in that piercing
tenor, so high in his range it confounds that part of the brain meant to
distinguish pain from pleasure. His mouth was open, his eyes were open,
his chest, open. His high voice had the sweetness of a child’s but a
confidence that signaled the man he might become, a man who might take
his own child’s hand in his own or comfort his grandmother or tell other
singers how to make their own most joyful sound. The song, Sam Cooke’s
civil rights anthem, is a poignant declaration of faith in the future, a
clarion call for a certain kind of 13-year-old. “I know, a change is
gonna come,” he sang, grave with certainty and calm anticipation. “Oooh,
yes it
is.”
