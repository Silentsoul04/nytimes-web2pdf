# A Family Portrait: Brothers, Sisters, Strangers

Photo essay by Eli Baden-Lasar  
Text by Eli Baden-Lasar as told to Susan Dominus

June 26, 2019

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

**It was never a secret** in my house that I was conceived with the help
of an anonymous sperm donor. For a majority of my childhood, I never
really thought about him. But when I was around 11, I went through a
period of having questions. My parents — I have two mothers — gave me a
photo copy of a questionnaire that was sent to them from the sperm bank
they used, California Cryobank. The donor filled it out in 1996, two
years before I was born.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I remember carrying the form with me in my backpack, taking it to school
and studying it occasionally when I remembered I had it. There was this
sense of touch — this person had used his hand to answer these
questions; I could see where he had crossed things out. It wasn’t that I
was so desperate to imagine who he was; it was enough to have proof that
he was real, entangled with who I am and yet, as that document showed,
totally separate. The form made him concrete, if inscrutable. It also
gave me the sense that there was this larger world, this process and
this bureaucracy that my existence was built upon. It was a way to help
me understand
myself.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I knew a lot of other children whose parents had used donors to conceive
because every summer we went to a camp for same-sex families. Last
summer, news traveled through the community that two kids from two
families who attended the camp for years had independently gone on to a
registry for family members trying to connect with donors or donor
siblings. The two discovered that they shared a donor — that they were
half siblings.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Until that moment, it had not really occurred to me — or my mothers,
even though one is an ObGyn — that I might have half siblings out there.
It makes no sense that we didn’t think about that, because my parents
deliberately chose a donor whose sperm had successfully produced at
least one live birth, whose sperm had, in a sense, “worked.” I think
they were just so focused on thinking about the new family they were
creating that they never stopped to think about the implications of the
huge, inadvertent social experiment they were joining.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The news about the two kids at camp made me curious to find out if *I*
had half siblings that I did not know about. So that same month, last
August, when I was 19, I dug up the questionnaire, went to the sibling
registry for California Cryobank, the largest sperm bank in the nation,
and typed in the donor’s number. I landed on a message board for
children of my particular donor and saw about a dozen cryptic user names
of various mothers or children who were perhaps hesitant to reveal
themselves completely. One jumped out at me — it said jplamb.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

*\[*[Sperm donors can’t stay secret anymore. Here’s what that
means.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/26/magazine/sperm-donor-questions.html)*\]*

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text chapterbreak">

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

**I grew up** in Oakland, but I spent a semester in high school at a
program in New York for kids interested in experiential learning, and
one friend I made there, I knew, had two mothers who used a sperm donor
to conceive him. His name was Gus Lamb. Right away, I texted him to ask
if he had registered on the California Cryobank. He said he had. We
exchanged donor numbers, and then we knew: We were half siblings.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

It was a moment of glee but also of horror. I knew that as a story it
was mind-blowing, but it was also disturbing — to have the script
switched, to go from friends to brothers. In our experiential-learning
program, we were constantly being asked to write personal essays to try
to understand our lives. For four months, we were doing that and reading
each other’s work and sleeping on the same floor of a dorm, all the
while not knowing that we were half brothers — the perversity of that
was not lost on either of us.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Sheepishly, we both wondered how that was possible: How could we not
have somehow known? But at the same time, we both recognized that it
didn’t seem so obvious. I had this suspicious feeling that scientists
were conducting an experiment, had taken a lunch break and then
forgotten to check back. But no one was watching through the two-way
mirror, and instead we were stuck looking at each other, reflected and
refracted, different people, but the same, mouths agape. If it was an
experiment, the variables had not yielded some thrilling result. There
had been no instant connection or unbreakable bond, and we easily lost
touch when the program ended.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

We got on the phone, me in California, Gus in Massachusetts. Gus told me
that he had never been especially drawn to learning more about the donor
siblings. His sister Izzy, however, who had the same donor, had done
research for medical reasons after having her appendix out. “There’s
tons of siblings,” Gus told me. That was another shock. Many of them, he
said, had been in touch for years. Gus and Izzy even had video-chatted
with a few.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

When we hung up, I told my parents what I’d learned, and they were
equally stunned. I felt both curious and anxious about these people and
what they exactly meant to me. The sheer quantity of them gave me a
feeling of having been mass-produced.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Even as I was trying to take this information in, I was realizing that
one way I could maybe make sense of all of this was through photography,
a medium I’ve been interested in from a young age. I could use the
camera as an excuse to meet each sibling and maybe the process of making
pictures would help me find some sort of stability, even as I also
recognized that conflict, discomfort and maybe even a kind of love would
be part of the experience.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text chapterbreak">

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

**The first people** I planned to shoot were Gus and Izzy. My younger
sister, Ruby, who was conceived using a different donor, traveled with
me to their home outside Boston. Hanging out with Gus felt familiar and
alien at the same time. Our time at that school together was a prologue;
now we were beginning again, and this time I was learning about him in a
different way. There are some things about a person you can’t understand
without seeing the place where they grew up. It’s a type of access and
point of view that allows you to see someone in a very vulnerable state:
This was their given life, messiness and all, not necessarily the life
they want to build for
themselves.

**I knew I** wanted to try to photograph all the siblings in the
environments in which they were raised, and I knew I wanted the images
to convey a sense of drama even when depicting quotidian scenes. I
decided to learn how to use a view camera, which is a large-format,
old-fashioned-looking film camera with bellows. It requires a lot of
technical fiddling, focusing and refocusing and finding the right angle,
which makes taking pictures incredibly, if not painfully, slow — usually
at least an hour. For the siblings, I think taking that kind of
photograph was strange, but it also allowed them to sit still and
concentrate on the picture as much as I was. The camera makes images
that are rich and detailed. I wanted something that was going to feel
like the opposite of mass production, that would have none of the
slickness that I was starting to associate with the sperm bank. It has a
clean, simple, commercial message about helping families and ads that
present donors as superheroes, their future babies as geniuses. I wanted
to produce something that would be exhaustive and overwhelming, that
would complicate the industry’s message — that would refute any simple
narratives.

<div class="g-item g-text">

In the picture of Gus and Izzy, they are posed in red plastic lawn
chairs that look like blown-up versions of toddler’s chairs. I was after
this combination of both a formality — in their almost regal posture —
and a whimsy or childishness, as if the chairs had grown up with them.

there one led me to another and another until I was in contact with all
of them. I kept those exchanges brief, because I wanted to feel the
potency of our first encounter.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I took Gus and Izzy to the next shoot. It was the first time I met a
sibling that I hadn’t already known, and I was suddenly more nervous
than I expected. When we all got out of the car, my hand began to
tremble so much that I dropped my keys. The physiological betrayal
rattled me, because I knew I was going to have to do this about 30 more
times. As a way of managing my nerves in the early meetings with
siblings, I was immediately focused on the work, on figuring out where
we would take the picture and what kind of image would be powerful. We
would walk together through various rooms in the house, contemplate our
options, before finally deciding on the right place.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

When I met Sadie, a college student in Portland, Ore., she was living in
a single room in a small guesthouse, so there was just one place we
could take the picture. We spent most of our time talking and listening
to “Best of Motown” from a massive speaker she found on Craigslist. She
started hunting through things she had bought in thrift stores that we
could use in the picture, like the half-moon visible above her head in
the photograph. But she also showed me things about her life that we
knew were not going to be in the image: her own photos, an album she
made of other people’s abandoned shopping lists.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

By then, it had become clear to me that 90 percent of the time that I
spent with each sibling needed to be unrelated to the photograph itself.
It needed to be about our getting to know each other, about my trying to
understand the other person’s life. It couldn’t be rushed. The emotional
labor of the project was intended to be almost reparative — a response
to the transactional nature of the sperm bank and the financial exchange
our parents made in order to create us.

**So many of** these kinds of half sibling relationships that I’ve heard
about are hard to sustain because they’re built over text and social
media — the geographical separations become too great, which can make it
easier for people to distance themselves. You can’t really get to know
someone online, this space where we make our lives more consumable for
one another. By meeting in person, there was no hiding.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Over 10 months, I traveled to 16 states to meet and shoot the 32
siblings. (One did not participate.) Sometimes I spent an afternoon,
sometimes a few days. I decided not to bring an assistant to help with
the light or make the process run more smoothly — even if that would
have helped produce the best images possible, technically.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Looking through the camera, I had a feeling I couldn’t shake: that these
people were all versions of me, just formed in different parts of the
country — but were also strangers who might as well have been picked out
of a hat. The camera gave me an excuse to study each person — to look
deeply at them in a way that without a camera would have been
uncomfortable and socially unacceptable.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Every once in a while, I would see something eerie about myself in one
of the other siblings that could completely scramble my sense of self —
the way that one’s neck became splotchy when she was uncomfortable or
the way another one bit his lip. Once, I heard a sibling laugh, and it
was so much my own laugh that it made the hair on my neck stand up.

In December, I made a trip to Honolulu, where I visited Kelsi Ikeda at
the home in which she grew up. It was the first place I traveled by
plane, and I remember waking up in her house that first morning feeling
disoriented. It was hot, I could feel the breeze of a fan, it smelled
different, and I was in a bunk bed. It took me a while to realize where
I was. And I remember thinking: Why am I here? Whom can I hold
accountable for this feeling? The bank? My parents? The donor? Myself?
What am I doing exactly? And what am I trying to accomplish?

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

At times, committing to a project like this has felt masochistic. I’m
generally an introverted person, and it was hard to feel as if I
constantly had to be on, performing the most appealing version of
myself. Though the feeling of performance quickly dissolved, I still had
a recurring sensation of being in a confused state of just-waking-up, of
trying to find my place in all these different parts of America as well
as in this strange social landscape.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I spent four days with Kelsi and her family, enough time that by the end
I felt a real affection for them all. In her picture, she’s wearing her
prom dress from junior year of high school. It feels funny, even tinged
with a hint of embarrassment, to try on the clothes of our past selves.
But it helped us get acquainted.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

During the time I spent with my half siblings, we exchanged secrets.
People get very confessional around a stranger who has no stake in their
life on a day-to-day basis. We had a connection, which meant they could
trust me, but I wasn’t a potential future friend they needed to impress.
I was something else — some third thing.

**The following month,** I met Daniel Claypoole, who could be described
as the great connector: He seeks siblings out and sort of holds the
group together. He’s social and extroverted and rallies people around
the idea of this being a group.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

He lives in Savannah, Ga., where he had been going to art school, but I
met him in Albuquerque. His two younger brothers, Zeke, 14, and Grayson,
4, who both share our donor, live there. His sister, who is 9, and who
does not share our donor, was there, too, and she was trying to explain
to Grayson who I was. I don’t know if he understood.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

I knew I wanted to make Grayson’s picture on that beanbag chair in their
living room. You can’t see it in the image, but the entire wall is
covered in a pattern of crosses. I set up one continuous light and
instructed Grayson, a typical frenetic little kid, to stay still.
Amazingly, he did. Many people find the hot light uncomfortable, but he
seemed warmed by it. When we left, he cried, and I felt a pang of guilt.
I’m sure he was crying over Daniel, but I also wondered what he made of
the word “brother,” which was thrown around when we were introduced,
because I knew I would most likely not see him again for a very long
time, if ever.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Daniel and I drove to Clovis, N.M., to visit the house he grew up in
with his grandmother, grandfather and great-grandmother. I wanted to
incorporate biographical details in the photograph, like the painting
hanging on the wall of his great-great-grandfather, a man with piercing
eyes who, he had been told, was the chief firefighter in Clovis. On the
bottom left of the photo you can see a dictionary in which his
great-grandmother stores the family photos — the wedding and baby
pictures are loosely tucked into random pages.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Even though Daniel has been in touch with other siblings for many years,
I was the first sibling from outside the family that his grandparents
had ever met. We felt very close by the end of the visit. I felt so
grateful for the way that his grandparents welcomed me, just as so many
other families had, giving me a place to sleep, a seat at family dinner.
It’s strange to think that I have been in all of their homes, but none
of them have ever been in mine or met my parents.

Finally, my mom told us at a McDonald’s drive-through. We were 17. My
brother’s reaction was, It doesn’t change anything. He’s close to my
dad. For me, it was like — life crisis. The very next day, I made my mom
help me find the donor number, and that was how I found the siblings.
They were so welcoming — like, ‘‘Hey, sister\!’’ I was like, ‘‘This is
so cool.’’ To me, it’s not healthy to have to keep how you’re made a
secret.”</span>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-textwrap">

<div class="g-item g-text">

I’m always hesitant to call anybody a brother or sister. But many of the
other siblings use that language very loosely. I don’t, probably because
I already have a sister, and she will always be most important to me.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

But I have been struck by the closeness that comes from the intensity of
the time that we spent together or, who knows, maybe something more than
that. I spent about 12 hours with one of the siblings, Neylan Griffy.
She drove me from Denver almost all the way to Kansas to show me where
she is from. It was pitch dark, and we talked the whole time. When I was
leaving Colorado, and we were saying goodbye, she said, almost with
trepidation: “I don’t know if it’s too early to say this, but I heart
you.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

She didn’t want to push me or expect anything; she was just expressing
her feelings. She was one of the first siblings to connect with others,
so she may be more comfortable with that. I laughed and said, “I heart
you, too.”

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

One of the last siblings I photographed was Dawson Johnson. One of the
others found him on 23andMe in January and connected me with him. He’d
never communicated with a sibling before me. I took Gus on my trip to
visit him, and the three of us met at an IHOP. He pulled up in a massive
black truck with oversize wheels. He’s muscular, a taekwondo instructor
who was a serious high school wrestler. I wanted to portray that side of
him in the picture but also to capture something about his manner, which
was gentle. In the photograph we made, I placed him shirtless and
beneath the truck, in this vulnerable state.

**At some point,** in each sibling encounter, we would inevitably end up
talking about the donor. He represented this absence we all had in
common, almost a spectral figure hovering above our lives. Some
siblings, once they turned 18, had written to the donor and received
long letters back. A different sibling told me that although he wasn’t
interested in actually contacting the donor, he wished he had the
ability to be invisible, to watch over him for one day as he went about
his life, a sort of inversion of the dynamic.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

At one point, Izzy got her hands on an audio interview of the donor that
the bank made and that another sibling’s mother had. (You can get more
information about the donor from the bank — more extensive questionnaire
forms or an audio recording — if you pay extra for it.) She, Gus, Kyle
Luzzi-Dundon (another sibling) and I listened to the recording one
night, huddled in a circle in a sort of séance.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The bank asks the donor at the end of the audio interview whether he has
anything he would like to tell any children conceived with his sperm.
Our donor’s response: “I wish them all the luck.” One sibling scribbled
that on his bedroom wall during high school in colorful chalk as if it
were an inspirational quote. I heard it more as an irreverent
provocation: *My job here is done. May the odds be ever in your favor.*

<div class="g-item g-ad">

<div class="g-ad-wrapper">

<div class="g-item g-text">

Trying to understand what the donor means to me has been complicated. I
never planned on trying to contact him, but I ultimately did to let him
know about this project. He declined to be a part of it at this stage.
To me, it is more interesting for him to remain the missing and
invisible figure he has always been. I don’t think he had any idea, at
the time he donated his sperm, that he was creating a kind of time
capsule that could potentially explode.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

For me, there is a strange pleasure in being able to collapse space and
time by putting all these people from all these different locations next
to one another. For the viewer, there might be intrigue in searching for
the similarities and differences among each of us or even just knowing
that we are all connected on this deeper, genetic level.

These pictures also capture a transitional stage in most of our lives —
we are at the close of adolescence, on the brink of becoming our adult
selves. *The basketball hoop has fallen in the front yard; the prom
dress has been tucked away in the back of the closet; the bicycle with
training wheels will soon be thrown out or given away.*

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

The project has no determined end, because other siblings may emerge in
the next weeks, months and years. Once, two siblings who hadn’t met yet
but who’d seen photos of each other discovered that they were in an
airport at the same time. This incident seemed to confirm our paranoia
that we might be walking by siblings all the time without knowing it: in
the streets, on the subway, at our liberal-arts colleges.

</div>

<div class="g-item g-text">

Since finishing the project, or at least this phase of it, I sometimes
feel this haze state fall over me, in which other people start to look
like me. One day recently, on the subway, a young man about my age sat
down across from me. Medium build, dark auburn hair, full lips, one of
the most consistent features in all the siblings. I looked at his hands
— they were knuckly and slender. They looked so much like mine. I
continued to stare and found myself on the brink of asking him an
uncomfortable question. But I didn’t, and instead I thought about what
it means to be able to see yourself in strangers — if, in the course of
this project, my capacity for empathy has grown, has opened me up, or if
the whole thing has been secretly rooted in self-interest, a fixation
with understanding who I am.
