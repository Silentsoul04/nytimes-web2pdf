Tucker Carlson went on his prime-time Fox News show in April last year
and told his viewers not to be fooled. The thousands of Central
Americans on their way to the United States were “border jumpers,” not
refugees, he said. “Will anyone in power do anything to protect America
this time,” he asked, “or will leaders sit passively back as the
invasion continues?”

When another group approached the border six months later, Ann Coulter,
appearing as a guest on Jeanine Pirro’s Fox News show, offered a
dispassionately violent suggestion about what could be done to stem the
flow of migrants: “You can shoot invaders.”

A few days after, Rush Limbaugh issued a grim prognosis to his millions
of radio listeners: If the immigrants from Central America weren’t
stopped, the United States would lose its identity. “The objective is to
dilute and eventually eliminate or erase what is known as the distinct
or unique American culture,” Mr. Limbaugh said, adding: “This is why
people call this an invasion.”

There is a striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing
media personalities and the language used by the Texas man who confessed
to [killing 22 people at a Walmart in El
Paso](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/04/us/el-paso-shooting-updates.html)
this month. In [a 2,300-word
screed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/03/us/patrick-crusius-el-paso-shooter-manifesto.html?module=inline)
posted on the website 8chan, the killer wrote that he was “simply
defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by
an invasion.”

It remains unclear what, or who, ultimately shaped the views of the
white, 21-year-old gunman, or whether he was aware of the media
commentary. But his post contains numerous references to “**invasion**”
and cultural “**replacement**” — ideas that, until recently, were
relegated to the fringes of the nationalist right.

An extensive New York Times review of popular right-wing media platforms
found hundreds of examples of language, ideas and ideologies that
overlapped with the mass killer’s written statement — a shared
vocabulary of intolerance that stokes fears centered on immigrants of
color. The programs, on television and radio, reach an audience of
millions.

<div class="g-annotations">

Here are three dozen instances on Fox News when immigration along the
Mexican border was discussed in terms of an **invasion**.

In November 2018 — as Republicans, who were facing a tough midterm
election, pushed the notion of a migrant “caravan” — references to
immigrants as invaders came up on more than three shows a day on
average.

“Calling it anything but an invasion at this point is just not being
honest with people,” Laura Ingraham, host of “The Ingraham Angle,” said
on her show on July 10.

Days after the shooting, the “Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade
dismissed a connection between words used by the gunman and by President
Trump, saying: “If you use the term ‘invasion,’ that’s not
anti-Hispanic. It’s a fact.”

</div>

</div>

</div>

In the four years since Mr. Trump electrified Republican voters with
slashing comments about Muslims and Mexicans, demonizing references to
immigrants have become more widespread in the news media, the Times
review found.

Sometimes the hosts are repeating the president’s signature phrases.
Sometimes the president appears to take his cues from television
pundits. The cumulative effect is a public dialogue in which denigrating
sentiments about immigrants are common.

Before the first groups of Central American migrants received heavy news
media coverage in 2018, words like “invaders” or “invasion” were rarely
used by American outlets. In the last year, the use of such terms has
surged, with references to an immigrant “invasion” appearing on more
than 300 Fox News broadcasts. The vast majority of those were spoken by
Fox News hosts and guests, but some included clips of Mr. Trump using
that language at rallies and other public appearances.

The Times analysis examined the last five years of show transcripts from
Fox News, CNN and MSNBC to measure the frequency of terms like
“invasion” and “replacement.” Segments that included this language
were verified by watching clips of the shows to determine whether hosts
and guests were speaking in their own words or reporting on the language
of others.

“It’s a bit of a vicious cycle,” said the conservative writer William
Kristol, a Republican critic of Mr. Trump’s who has worked at Fox News
and other networks. “Something is said on Fox News, and Trump repeats
it, and that legitimizes it — and then someone else goes a little
further.”

He added, “The use of what once would have been viewed as really extreme
and inappropriate and sometimes conspiratorial, sometimes dehumanizing
language is really striking.”

While the notion of immigrants as a national threat was a feature of the
conservative Patrick Buchanan’s unsuccessful bids to win the Republican
presidential nominations in 1992 and 1996 (he used the phrase “illegal
invasion” then), they ran counter to the Republican Party’s efforts to
make itself more appealing to Hispanics and other minorities in the two
decades before Mr. Trump became its front-runner.

The portrayal of immigration as a menace has returned with force, a
shift brought on not just by radio and TV hosts, but by Republican
leaders in Congress and the president himself. This year Mr. Trump has
used the terms “invasion” or “invaded” seven times on Twitter to
describe the situation at the border, at one point referring to the
approach of the migrants as “the attempted Invasion of Illegals.” At
rallies, he has injected terms like “predator,” “killer,” and “animal”
in his [descriptions of
immigrants](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/08/08/trump-immigrants-rhetoric-criticized-el-paso-dayton-shootings/1936742001/).

The Trump-friendly media world — from outlets like Sinclair Broadcast
Group and The Drudge Report to platforms like Breitbart News and Gateway
Pundit — has used similar incendiary rhetoric. “The fact of the matter
is that this is an attempted invasion of our country — period,” Boris
Epshteyn, a former Trump campaign adviser, [said last year in a
commentary on
migrants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/28/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-segment-trump-migrants.html)
that aired on nearly 200 Sinclair television stations.

At the start of the El Paso suspect’s screed, he refers to the “[great
replacement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/06/us/politics/grand-replacement-explainer.html),”
a white supremacist conspiracy theory based on a French book that claims
the migration of minority groups can lead to a “genocide” of white
culture.

The El Paso suspect, who
[confessed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/09/us/el-paso-suspect-confession.html)
to the mass shooting last week, claimed in the document he posted to be
defending against a “Hispanic invasion of Texas.” The words “invasion”
and “invaders” appear six times in the text, a stark parallel to the
language heard on conservative television and talk radio today.

Before the El Paso shootings, others with deadly or hateful motives used
the same language.

The replacement theory was prominent in a document posted on 8chan by
the suspect in [the massacre that killed 51
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/13/world/australia/christchurch-shootings-not-guilty-plea.html?rref=collection%2Fspotlightcollection%2Fchristchurch-attack-new-zealand&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=8&pgtype=collection)
in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March.

The man who is alleged to have killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh
synagogue last October had expressed his contempt for
“[invaders](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html)”
before he opened fire on the congregation with an AR-15-style assault
rifle, the authorities say. During the white supremacist demonstrations
in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 that left one woman dead, marchers
shouted, “You will not replace us.”

Lawrence Rosenthal, a professor at the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing
Studies, said that the shared vocabulary of white nationalists and many
prominent conservatives was chilling. “Where that intersects with the
Republican Party today,” he added, “is the Republican argument that the
Democrats are in favor of immigration because that will give them a
permanent majority.”

Mr. Limbaugh, whose syndicated radio show has a weekly audience of 15
million, has trafficked in similar themes.

<span class="g-mention"> “<span class="g-quote">We need to stop viewing
struggling Americans as defective people who deserve to be **replaced**

Mr. Carlson’s shows routinely feature discussions of being **replaced**
by immigrants.

Mr. Carlson, whose show averages about three million viewers a night,
has featured guests who subscribe to the replacement theory, like Peter
Szijjarto, the foreign minister to Hungary’s nationalistic president,
Viktor Orban. In February, Mr. Carlson and Mr. Szijjarto discussed the
need to increase birthrates in their respective countries. Otherwise,
Mr. Carlson said, “our plan here in the West is to just let the
depressed people die off and replace them with people from other
countries.”

Another prime-time Fox News host, Laura Ingraham, who was considered for
a communications job in the Trump administration, has used similar
language. Last October, she warned viewers that their opinions “will
have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats
who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied
citizens and an ever-increasing number of chain migrants.”

Fox News had no comment.

The overlap between fringe ideology and the words of conservative talk
show hosts is not accidental, critics say. “They’re putting that into
the zeitgeist,” said Carl Cameron, the former chief political
correspondent for Fox News, who is now working for a news aggregator
aimed at a progressive audience, Front Page Live.

“Fox goes out and looks for stuff that is inherently on fire and foments
fear and anger,” Mr. Cameron added.

The use of “invasion” and “invaders” has also surfaced on outlets away
from right-wing media. The Times review of demonizing terms for
immigrants found a spike in such terms in 2018 on CNN and MSNBC, but
almost exclusively in the context of reporting how leading conservatives
had been using such language.

Fox News, it should be noted, is not monolithic. While its prime-time
lineup of Mr. Carlson, Sean Hannity and Ms. Ingraham is devoted to
right-wing commentary, some of the network’s news reporters, like the
anchor Shepard Smith, have taken pains to refute misleading language
about migrants. Chris Wallace, the “Fox News Sunday” host, recently
grilled the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, about the racism
inherent in Mr. Trump’s critical remarks about Baltimore.

Days after the El Paso massacre, [Mr. Carlson said
on-air](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/08/business/media/tucker-carlson-white-supremacy.html)
that white supremacy was “actually not a real problem in America” and
likened it to a “hoax.” His words ignited widespread criticism,
including from fellow conservative commentators like Erick Erickson and
a Fox News weekend anchor, [Arthel
Neville](https://twitter.com/ArthelNeville/status/1159470690132619265).

The next night, Mr. Carlson returned to his show and urged his critics
to “calm down,” warning about the roiling divisions in the country,
before announcing that he was leaving on a vacation that he and Fox News
said had been previously
planned.
