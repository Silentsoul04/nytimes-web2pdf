The 1619 Project The 1619 Project is an ongoing initiative from The New
York Times Magazine that began in August 2019, the 400th anniversary of
the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe the country's
history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of
black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.\\

We asked you to share photographs and stories of your enslaved
ancestors. The images and stories helped paint a picture of a
too-often-erased American history.

We asked you how you learned about slavery in school. You told us about
degrading role play, flawed lessons and teachers who played down its
horrors.

Behind the Scenes of 1619

Since January, The Times Magazine has been working on an issue to mark
the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved people arriving in America.

For teachers

Looking for ways to use this issue in your classroom? You can find
curriculums, guides and activities for students developed by the
Pulitzer Center at
\href{http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/1619-project-pulitzer-center-education-programming}{pulitzercenter.org/1619}.
And it's all free!

\textbf{Correction: Sept. 4, 2019}

An earlier version of the introduction to this project referred
incorrectly to Virginia in the year 1619 as a British colony. At the
time, it was an English colony.~
