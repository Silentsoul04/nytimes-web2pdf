<span>In New York, hope sometimes comes at the price of the sun.</span>

<span>The city welcomes poor immigrants, but its housing does not. Most
rents are far beyond the means of people like Amado, who arrive looking
for a better life or to make money to send back home.</span>

<span>So they turn to the basements of
Queens.</span>

</div>

<div class="g-asset-media" data-slug="BASEMENTS_01NEW" data-embed="" data-fragment="">

<div class="g-item-asset">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>Underneath the borough lives a shadow city of illegal apartments,
shielded from the light.</span>

<span>Owners of one- and two-family homes have carved up their basements
into makeshift dorms, illicitly constructed with narrow hallways,
windowless bedrooms, shaky walls and electrical wiring strung together
like knotted shoelaces. There is no accurate count of how many exist,
but estimates are in the tens of
thousands.</span>

<div class="g-item-asset">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>An open secret, the basements are a haven for thousands of people
who work in restaurant kitchens, on delivery bikes, in small factories
or on construction sites.</span>

<span>They live in tiny rooms alone, or share tight spaces with
strangers, or even sleep in
shifts.</span>

The apartments are unquestionably dangerous. But there is also a kind of
safety there. Immigrants from all over the world, undocumented and
documented, have found sanctuary in Queens among people who share their
language, food and culture.

</div>

<div id="g-item-4" class="g-item g-asset" data-type="asset">

<div class="g-item-asset">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>The small, dark room where Amado stays costs $650 a month. His
share is $325. His roommate is undocumented, and so is his roommate’s
brother, who earlier this year frequently stayed over and shared a twin
bed. The brothers slept head-to-toe, back-to-back, while Amado lay on
his twin bed, quietly reading the Old
Testament.</span>

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>Queens is the city’s most diverse borough, with 800 languages
spoken among its residents. Vendors work long into the night because
people are always on their way to or from
work.</span>

<span>All over, “FOR RENT” signs dot windows in homes and cover
electrical poles. There is no explanation of the rules, and no warning
of danger. The basement apartments differ considerably in size, quality
and
legality.</span>

<div id="g-item-9" class="g-item g-asset" data-type="asset">

<div class="g-item-asset">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>The threat of raids by immigration authorities had residents on
edge during the summer. But immigrants said they still feel a great deal
of protection in Queens, where there is more access to free legal help
to assist them with their
cases.</span>

</div>

<div class="g-asset-media" data-slug="BASEMENTS_08NEW" data-embed="" data-fragment="">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>They can also find housing that is less expensive than in other
places, even if it does not meet city building standards. Eight areas in
Queens are consistently among the top 10 places in the city with the
most complaints for illegal home
conversions.</span>

</div>

<div class="g-asset-media" data-slug="queensmap" data-embed="" data-fragment="queensmap2">

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-item g-copyblock" data-type="copyblock">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

Those conversions can lead to tragedies, including cases where residents
could not escape fast-moving fires that enveloped basements where they
lived.

Pushed by advocacy groups like Chhaya, which focuses on the housing
needs of South Asian residents, the city recently started a pilot
program that will provide homeowners with loans to install windows,
carbon monoxide and smoke detectors, and separate exits. But it will
benefit just 40 homeowners in Brooklyn.

</div>

</div>

<div id="g-item-13" class="g-item g-asset" data-type="asset">

<div class="g-item-asset">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>City law says a basement’s ceilings must be at least 7 feet 6
inches high. Living spaces must have a window. The city must approve
apartments with a certificate of occupancy before they can be
rented.</span>

</div>

<div class="g-asset-media" data-slug="BASEMENTS_09" data-embed="" data-fragment="">

</div>

<div id="g-item-14" class="g-item g-asset" data-type="asset">

<div class="g-item-asset">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>Such rules make practically all of the basement housing stock in
Queens illegal, including Amado’s home. The ceilings where he lives are
just under seven feet high and the space has no visible smoke detectors.
More than half of the apartment sits underground, which technically
makes the home a cellar. In New York, all cellars are illegal
dwellings.</span>

<div id="g-item-15" class="g-item g-asset" data-type="asset">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>Amado’s room shares a window with the room next to his. He cannot
use it as an exit in case of an emergency. It is too small. And if he
opens or closes the window, it affects the other room, like a window
that sits between two rows on an
airplane.</span>

The home had been cited years earlier for illegal conversion and illegal
occupancy. But according to city records, an inspector had not visited
since November 2003, when he could not get inside. When he returned
three weeks later, he did not find any boarders.

<div id="g-item-17" class="g-item g-asset" data-type="asset">

<div class="g-item-asset">

<div class="g-asset-copy">

<span>But the basement apartment was eventually filled again. Amado
moved in a few years ago after spotting a sign in a window. Most of the
time he and his roommates stay quiet. The only visible sign of life is
the light coming through the slots under the men’s closed bedroom
doors.</span>
