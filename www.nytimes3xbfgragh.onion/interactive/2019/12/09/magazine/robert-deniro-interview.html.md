Disturbingly stoic, violent and seeking absolution he’s not sure he
needs, the mob killer Frank Sheeran allowed Robert De Niro to deliver a
majestic, subtle performance in [“The
Irishman”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/27/movies/the-irishman-review.html)
that has the feel of a crowning achievement — and for reasons that go
beyond the screen. Based on Sheeran’s memoir, “I Heard You Paint
Houses,” the film is haunted by the cinematic moments that De Niro,
the director Martin Scorsese and the co-stars Al Pacino and Joe Pesci
have made in so many movies about hard men with hollowed hearts. “The
fact that me, Joe and Al were doing this film is something in and of
itself,” said the halting, taciturn De Niro, who also played a key role
in this fall’s controversial, Scorsese-indebted
[“Joker.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/03/movies/joker-review.html)
“Marty directing it says something. It all sets a tone. The audience’s
perception of each character, us actors being together and what the
story is — the film is all those things.” It’s also a reminder, as if we
needed one, of the brutal and beautifully unsentimental revelations that
only a peak De Niro performance can provide.

**In getting ready to play Frank Sheeran, you dug deep into the source
material, and you also spoke with people who knew the guy. But I’m
curious how your thinking about preparation has changed over the years.
You’ve said in the past that you don’t kill yourself with it the way you
did when you were younger.** What I meant was that maybe it’s not as
necessary to be so obsessed. It’s better at times to be relaxed. Do all
the preparation before, and then just do the scene, and don’t be anxious
about it or amped up about what it is. Getting so concerned about an
emotional scene — you can kind of short-circuit whatever’s going to
come.

**Was there a performance that led to that realization?** No. I just
felt that a real emotional situation in life comes due to the
circumstances around you. If you prepare too much — you know the joke
about the actor who couldn’t remember any lines?

**No, I don’t know it.** This actor can’t remember lines, so he can’t
get a job. A director he knows runs into him at the gas station where
he’s working. The director says: “I have a play that in the third act,
what you do is go and say, ‘Hark, I hear the cannons roar.’ Can I count
on you to do that?” The actor says he’ll do it. He goes and rehearses,
rehearses, rehearses. “Hark, I hear the cannons roar. Hark, I hear the
cannons roar.” On the day of the play, the third act comes, and the
actor runs out onstage. Boom\! The cannon goes boom, and the actor goes,
“What the \[expletive\] was that?\!” The point is, you don’t want to
lose
spontaneity.

**Earlier in your career, there was a lot of attention paid to how you
changed your body for your work in, to pick just the most famous
example, “Raging Bull.” In “The Irishman,” your body changed too, but
the changes were made digitally, to allow you to look younger. How did
it affect the performance not to be able to feel those changes
physically?** Well, it’s harder to act younger than it is the other way
round. We had a guy named Gary Tacon who was a movement coach. He would
tap you and say, “You’re 39 in this scene.” In one case, I was walking
down the stairs a little more carefully than my character would’ve, and
Gary showed me that you kind of fall down the stairs when you’re
younger. So I did that. I did it well. Marty cut it out because he
didn’t need it. But it was that kind of stuff. You have to be aware of
having a certain spryness.

**And you felt that you could credibly achieve that?** I felt that, but
even so, some people felt it was not — they weren’t criticizing it. They
were saying they could see my real age. O.K., fine, that’s interesting.
I should’ve taken steroids or something. They’ll youth-ify you or de-age
you or whatever, but you still can’t look like you’re crotchety. It’s a
good thing. You know, Marty would see, and I saw it, too, that there
would be an expression in my eyes during a scene, but after they
youth-ified me, my eyes had a different emotional expression. Marty was
concerned about that. I had the right emotional intention, the right
attitude, but when that de-aging came, the expression in the eye
changed. So they had to figure out a way to make sure that after I was
youth-ified it would not alter the intention of the scene as we acted
it. It was an interesting problem.

**You could think about a character like Frank — or a lot of people
you’ve played — as fundamentally inhumane as written on the page. But
you have a way of infusing all these vicious characters with something
approaching soul. Are there keys to doing that?** The rule in acting is
you never make a judgment about your character. The characters have
their reasons, and you understand them. You’re trying to look at their
point of view. I mean, in “The Irishman,” Frank has a problem with his
daughter. He has problems that anybody can relate to. I never thought of
him as being amoral or immoral. He lives in a world where the penalties
are harsh if you don’t do what you’re supposed to do. He says he’s going
to do something, he does it. I don’t like to go to Trump, but he is a
person who, to me, has no morals, no ethics, no sense of right and
wrong, is a dirty
player.

Performers issue, honoring the best actors of the year.

**Could you find your way into the character of President Trump?** I
wouldn’t want to play him. He’s such an awful person. There’s nothing
redeemable about him, and I never say that about any character.

**You found redemptive qualities in Travis Bickle, and you’re saying you
couldn’t do the same if you were playing President Trump?** I can’t
compare. There’s not one moment that Trump said: “I’m sorry. I realize
I’ve done something that I shouldn’t have done.” He has not one speck
of redeemability in him. He’s not owed one speck of redeemability.

**People have argued that some of Trump’s rhetoric has emboldened others
to make threats or enact violence. Those arguments are not a world away
from ones that people made about Travis Bickle or “Joker.” Do you think
those arguments hold water?** They might, but Trump has people who
follow him who are crazy and want to do crazy things. What we’re doing
in film, it’s like a dream. We know it’s not real. There are people who
will take anything to be real and that we have no control over. The
president is supposed to set an example of trying to do the right thing.
Not be a nasty little bitch. Because that’s what he is. He’s a petulant
little punk. There’s not one thing that I see in him or his family, not
any redeeming qualities. They’re out on the take. It’s like a gangster
family.

**To shift subjects a bit, what about if somebody were looking to play
you? Would you be willing to talk with them and help out with their
preparation?** That’s a good question. I don’t know. I’ve always
experienced that people are open because they want you to get it right.
They want to give you information. With [“Raging
Bull,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/1980/11/14/archives/robert-de-niro-in-raging-bull.html)
Jake LaMotta was great with me and Marty. He was happy that we were
making a movie about him. Certain things, maybe it was our
interpretation. That’s the same with Frank Sheeran and “The Irishman.”
In acting they say: Make it your own. Personalize it. It’s the same
thing with these stories. There has to be some — I don’t like to say
poetic license, because that has a negative connotation when it
shouldn’t — but it’s a way of expressing how you see it. It doesn’t
mean it’s right. But it’s how you see yourself.

**What did you see in yourself that you put into Frank Sheeran?** Aha\!
*That* is the
question.

</div>

**What’s the answer?** That is the question, but the answer is personal.
I mean, when I talked to Marty about certain things about the film —
sometimes he’s like a priest. We talk, and I have to be honest with him
in order to get stuff in the film that we need to say. But it’s personal
stuff that I would express through the character. It’s not stuff I’d
tell other people.

**I know you’ve thought about one day sitting down and watching all your
own movies. What would you hope to see?** I would probably be
apprehensive, because I’m critical about what I did. But the other thing
is what I could learn if I looked at all my stuff and got an idea of
what I’ve done, what the pattern is. Because I’d like to do something
that’s really different from what I’ve done or been known to do.

**If you watched all your performances, do you think you’d feel any
pride?** I have reasons that I look at my stuff and I’m not happy. Other
people look at my stuff and say they don’t even know what I’m talking
about. I don’t know. It’s not for me to say.
