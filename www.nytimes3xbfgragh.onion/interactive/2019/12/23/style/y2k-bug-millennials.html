My friends and I sometimes joined Yahoo! singles chat rooms and shrieked as we answered A/S/L, which for my parents sake I won’t define."},{"p":"Then, seemingly overnight, the machine in my living room was a source of danger. It could make the electricity cut out. It could make planes fall out of the sky. Missiles might launch; unintended wars could — and probably would — begin. There was no escape from the web of it, no unplugging. The best bet was to stockpile canned food and water — and we did. I kept my Swiss army knife close."},{"p":"I remember counting down the minutes until the supposed meltdown of my neighborhood. It came. Nothing happened. But the fear it incited defined my generation."},{"p":"“Millennials had an adolescence associated with apocalyptic dread,” said Lee Quinby, a former lecturer at Macaulay Honors College, who was part of a national Y2K research center at the time. “The Y2K moment was shaped by terror and social media, before it was quite called that,” Ms. Quinby said. “But it suddenly was possible to spread apocalyptic fear over the internet.”"},{"p":"And people did."},{"p":"On Dec. 1, 1999, dubbed “Y2K Anxiety Day”, <span id=\"1800therapist\">1-800-Therapist</span> offered specials and placed a fleet of “experts” on call. The hotline’s website enumerated <span id=\"1800therapist-tensteps\">10 steps</span> for managing Y2K-related fear.

Now it often seems like millennial is just shorthand for the worst generation."},{"p":"We suffered the reputational damage, but we didn’t create these unstable contraptions built on old code."},{"p":"That problem was of the boomers’s making. Because Y2K — often called the Millennium Bug — was not a bug at all. It was a design decision. It came from an old programming language called COBOL. In that code, which laid the foundation for modern computing, the programmers had decided to drop the first two digits off the year to save time and computer power. So instead of 1999, it was just 99. The 00 of the new millennium was a flaw from the start. It was classic corner cutting."},{"p":"","ad":"24"},{"p":"“Even as we were buying new electronics, we were living with old choices, old practices, old decisions, old shortcuts,” Mr. Mulvin said."},{"p":"Most young coders had stopped working in COBOL years earlier. It was an old language and those who worked in it were typically paid less than those who went into the new, more nimble Java. And so to patch Y2K, companies and governments pulled COBOL coders out of retirement and off golf courses, paying them more than they had ever earned to lure them back to the work force."},{"p":"The practice of outsourcing software work to India <a href=\"https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2008/09/11/world/asia/11iht-letter.1.16064464.html\">sprang</a> from Y2K preparation. American companies hired slews of Indian programmers to repair the faulty software, and those pipelines remained."},{"p":"One lesson my generation learned from Y2K: We would be inheriting something broken and old, and we didn’t have the skills to fix it."},{"p":"“After being told for years that technology is the path to a highly evolved future, it’s come as something of a shock to discover that a computer system is not a shining city on a hill — perfect and ever new — but something more akin to an old farmhouse built bit by bit over decades by nonunion carpenters,” Ellen Ullman wrote in Wired magazine."},{"p":"The clock struck midnight. A few DMVs reported problems. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/14/martinwainwright\">Sheffield</a>, England, two women had abortions after being told, incorrectly, that their children would have Down syndrome."},{"p":"But public consensus was: It was a fizzle. Maybe even a hoax. Early viral fake news of the sort that now floods our social networks. This also was a lie. Y2K was a completely real crisis."},{"p":"And the last lesson of Y2K is that somehow we would get blamed. The moment passed. If anything, it became a punch line."},{"p":"Our moniker — millennials — was not a sign of what we were burdened with, but a sort of insult. We were soon going to be the snowflakes and the coddled. Hysterical with millennialist thinking, and oversensitive to nothings."},{"p":"Looking back on Y2K, the derided nexus of anxiety for a derided, anxious generation, no other moment could have prepared us better. Later, the financial crisis would mean many of us had to live with our parents after college, and this was seen as a funny generational flaw (failure to launch). College debt would leave us putting off children, but it would be considered proof that we were selfish."},{"p":"But planes did fall out of the sky a year later. The markets did crash.

In contrast to more individualistic forms of prepping — cartons of MREs and ammunition in a locked bunker — Ms. Beal’s preparation considered community from the start. She advised preparing for “any emergency, not just the crisis du jour,” she remembered, and including your neighbors in your planning. (She helped settle Mr. Atlee.) She entertained the worst probabilities but did not fixate on them. She was budget-minded. “Since it was highly likely Y2K would be a minimal disturbance for most, chances are my ‘preps’ wouldn’t even be needed,” she said. “And a small independent grocer has no money to waste.” Ms. Beal didn’t need to construct elaborate scenarios for inspiration; her grandmother was a grocer, too, in Harlan Country, Ky. during the Depression, and through the coal strikes, where her store helped keep its community alive. Her grandmother’s store eventually went out of business, crushed by debt."},{"p":"Now, Ms. Beal runs cemeteries, specializing in natural burial. “Y2K had us considering some pretty dire possibilities, even if they were at the improbable end of the spectrum,” she said, “and in the course of my research I came to learn that most of us don’t pay attention to death very well.” An encounter with cancer completed the transition. “I discovered I didn’t have a problem planning for death,” she said. “I enjoy helping other people think around their own end-of-life corners, whether it be an emergency to prep for or an eventual death, in ways that are practical and empowering,” she said — inevitable moments that aren’t fixed on the calendar, instead of the other way around."},{"p":"<div class=\"bug bug2\"></div>"},{"p":"Paloma O’Riley, who goes by PJ and lives in Fairbanks, Alaska, spent New Year’s Eve 1999 out with family and friends. “It was a party — of course, everyone was throwing millennium parties everywhere,” she said. It was a good one, she said, with lights, champagne, sparklers, the whole deal. She was glad that lights stayed on, although she wasn’t really expecting them to go off, and felt, like many of the other Y2K optimists, a mixture of relief and thankfulness. In addition to her civilian Y2K work, her and her husband had worked in industrial compliance: she at Rover Group, he at a hard drive company. “There were thousands upon thousands of people who put their shoulder to the wheel and did the actual work of fixing the problem,” she said. “We dodged a bullet, and it was because of their effort,” she said."},{"p":"She didn’t want credit, and she got something else anyway. “Instead of celebrating the fact that nothing happened, people got mad,” she said."},{"p":"Her message, she thought, had been consistent: “This is not something to be afraid of, it’s just something that needs to be addressed.” She’d heard plenty about the cranks — they were all over the media, and local survivalist groups in Colorado, where she lived at the time, were sympathetic — and had done what she could to assuage their concerns. The apocalypse wasn’t coming. Planes weren’t going to fall out of the sky. Missiles weren’t going to launch.

I was going to the White House for meetings. I was testifying.”"},{"p":"“It was heartening, and it was wonderful,” she said. “There were so many people interested in helping their neighbors, who didn’t want to dig a hole and hide. I was thrilled to death that people were really banding together in the face of this potential problem,” she remembered."},{"p":"Her Y2K comedown was quick, exacerbated by years of misdiagnosis and pain.

They want to find communal answers to global problems. What motivated people then is what motivated people now, and we’re meeting the same headwinds,” she said. “If we manage to come up with a workable response to climate change, and we’re able to stave off the worst of the problems, I expect we’ll have the same kind of response,” she said. That, she said, would be just fine."},{"p":"Today, Ms. O’Riley is as active in her community as her health allows, and is currently thinking about how her local hospital can coordinate better with its volunteers. In Alaska, where she also lived when she was younger, “contingency planning is a part of life.” She lost touch with most of her Y2K compatriots, and the resources they assembled fell victim the web’s shockingly rapid rate of decay."},{"p":"It might be a stretch to lump in Charles W. Bennett, who was in the late 1990s the chief of police in Lynchburg, Va. with the Y2K optimists, but he, too, remembers them as hopeful times. As the emergency preparedness coordinator for the city, he began convening monthly Y2K meetings. It made his job easier. “We included a much wider selection of participants than your normal emergency preparedness,” he said. “We saw an opportunity to do more inclusive planning.” He, too, was glad to see midnight pass without interruption; he was also glad to see the regular meetings continue, albeit on a yearly basis, into the new century. Part of the preparation involved setting up a new desk to manage post-disaster needs and resources, matching, for example, housebound residents with particular needs — oxygen, medicine, or fuel for a generator — with, among others, members of the local off-roading club. This evolved into a secondary emergency response system used during severe weather. “It was very well received by the community,” he said."},{"p":"Valentine K. Ridell, who ran the Galisteo Y2K Citizen Preparedness Committee in New Mexico, remembers Y2K organizing instead as a thankless task. In such a small town, she already felt like an outlier. “Most of the folks I knew down there, and that I met, were very individualistic,” she said (She has since moved 30 minutes up the road to Santa Fe.) She worked as an emergency medical worker, but didn’t find much interest among her peers in fire and rescue, either. Even among those receptive to talking about preparedness, their instincts were discouraging. “You don’t just buy your rice and hoard it,” she said. “What are we going to do if we really run out of everything? Grab a gun and shoot my neighbor?” She now understands that this experience was a preview of things to come. It echoed her region’s response to the disastrous fires that would ravage it over the next two decades, and, she said, the national situation today. “I’m amazed to learn that there is this side to the American public — so angry, so vindictive, and which has become in so many ways so very dangerous,” she said. She currently runs Orenda Healing International, which exists “to promote individual and community health and well-being through innovative education and applicable research in a broad range of fields.” The latest edition of its publication, Four Winds Journal, asks, “how will we feed our families and communities if what we’re used to becomes unavailable?”"},{"p":"For Kathy Garcia, a former community liaison for the Cassandra Project, Y2K was, basically, just another storm. She had been involved in community organizing and emergency preparedness through the 90s, and helped coordinate Y2K efforts in Boulder, Co. which put her in touch with Ms. O’Riley. “I’d say, l, this is not just about a Y2K event, this is about a snowstorm, a rain event — any of these things can happen,” she said. “It was a means for me to get the message of preparedness, and of checking in on your neighbor.”"},{"p":"Today, Ms. Garcia works in the legal department of the Nature Conservancy, with a focus on risk. She also volunteers with the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office Department of Emergency Management, where she works in logistics, making sure, for example, that firefighters get fed during emergencies. Y2K, in the end, was good news — a storm that didn’t come. In Boulder, Colo.<em> </em>in the time since, plenty have — snow, unpredictable fire, a catastrophic flood — and Ms. Garcia sees a pattern. “People breathe a sigh of a relief. And then they minimize.”"},{"p":"<div class=\"bug bug4\"></div>"},{"p":"It’s easy to understand how hopeful thinking disappeared so completely from the Y2K story. The uneventful turnover at midnight didn’t help, of course. Most people engaged in what Mr. Atlee prefers to call “collective thinking about positive possibilities” weren’t in the business of prediction — or in any business at all — so they didn’t make good targets for post-Y2K schadenfreude, either. Their calls to action didn’t depend on the arrival of a specific scenario, which might have made them more durable, if it didn’t also make them uncomfortable to reckon with after the fact. It was a moment, Mr. Atlee said, in which people were tying to figure out how to live positively through a period of “radical uncertainty” — a state we’ve hardly left since.

Starting in 2001, you could instant message him on AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger, the same way you would any of the human contacts on your buddy list. Unlike some of your friends, with their clever away messages and eventual bedtimes, he would always respond. That was why people talked to him, and tens of millions of people — particularly those between the ages of 10 and 16 — talked to SmarterChild."},{"p":"“The idea was this is the wild viral new way of getting information on the internet,” said Pat Guiney, who wrote SmarterChild’s responses. “We were going to transform the way that people interact with technology and with the internet."},{"p":"Mr. Guiney was 32 when he was hired by ActiveBuddy, SmarterChild’s parent company. He had been a writer for an online games company, but it went out of business in 2000. He found a job offer for a company developing chatbots, and though he didn’t know what a chatbot was back then, he went for an interview at the offices of ActiveBuddy on 25th Street, right off Fifth Avenue. On his first day of work, he was tasked with developing “responses for a list of hundreds of the most grotesque profanities you could possibly imagine,” he said."},{"p":"When someone said something rude, “SmarterChild would be like, ‘Wow that’s a crazy thing to say, I don’t like that at all,’” Mr. Guiney said. (SmarterChild would also demand apologies and give the silent treatment to those who withheld them.)"},{"p":"Mr. Guiney loved his job. “It was very entertaining to see what people were saying and see if I could create something more interesting and more compelling, keeping in mind that in the end it’s this ultimately pointless thing,” he said."},{"p":"SmarterChild’s creators had conflicting visions for what the bot could bring for users. Some wanted the bot to be pure personality, all character. But others argued for its utility. SmarterChild could tell you the weather, the sports scores, the movie showtimes, the headlines."},{"p":"","ad":"16"},{"p":"But people were chatting with SmarterChild for other, more emotional reasons, too."},{"p":"“They were lonely. They were bored. They were angry,” Mr. Guiney said. “And so we decided to engage them in conversation to see how long we could keep their attention. We wanted it to be entertaining and then sometimes accidentally kind of profound or something.”"},{"p":"Mr. Guiney looked to keep user conversations with SmarterChild as open-ended as possible. “I’m not a computer programmer, so I had to learn this from the real software engineers at the company,” he said. “But they sort of showed me that you could capture what the person said and repeat it back to them.”"},{"p":"“If you said ‘My foot hurts,’ we wouldn’t have a specific response, but I would say: ‘What’s making it hurt?’ or ‘Is there something else that hurts?’”"},{"p":"Aches and pains made up a small fraction of conversation topics users raised. “The obvious places that they would go in a lot of cases, were predictably, there would be some mention of sex or a proposition about sex,” Mr. Guiney said. Keywords tipped his team off to the fact that a chatter was attempting bot seduction, though they did not explicitly know what was being said in the moment. A typical programmed response, Mr. Guiney said, was something like, “‘That’s very provocative. Are you sure that’s an appropriate thing to say?’ Then the person would get frustrated or enraged or whatever.”"},{"p":"Through talking with users, SmarterChild got smarter. He kept track of what people liked and what they didn’t like. So when a 12-year-old in Utah would say she liked Blink-182, SmarterChild would record that and tally up people who liked or disliked bands. Eventually, SmarterChild started opening conversations by telling people which bands he liked. “I really like U2,” he’d say."},{"p":"In 2004, when <span id=\"georgebush\">George W. Bush</span> was running for re-election, SmarterChild developed a dislike for the incumbent. “He would say so,” Mr. Guiney recalled. “He would say, ‘Hey I really don’t like George W.

Every decision has been informed by an awareness of deep time. Bearings are made of zirconium nitride ceramic — typically an aerospace material — because it doesn’t need to be lubricated. “Everything is made out of brass or some sort of precious metal,” a person with knowledge of the project told me. “If you’re pouring concrete, you typically put rebar into it. But that’ll rust. So instead of rebar they’re using stainless steel.” A window cut in the mountain will let in enough light to power a solar synchronizer, which will make sure the clock is aligned with solar noon.

On YouTube, they vlog themselves “living in the 2000s <span id=\"vlog1\">for a day</span>” or for <span id=\"vlog2\">the weekend</span>.","footnotes":[{"id":"vlog1","h":"","by":"","type":"small","paragraphs":[{"p":"","embed_id":"youtube_vlog1"}],"fig_number":1},{"id":"vlog2","h":"","by":"","type":"small","paragraphs":[{"p":"","embed_id":"youtube_vlog2"}],"fig_number":2}]},{"p":"“You know when you’re a little girl, and you play role model games? It’s like that but for teenagers, you’re playing dress up,” said Victoria Johnson, 19, who runs @y2khottie."},{"p":"But because Y2K fans were babies or not even born yet, their perception of the early 2000s is shaped almost entirely by movies and media that paint a glossy image of the often fraught and anxiety filled experience of being a teenager."},{"p":""},{"p":"Nicole Randone, 19, who runs @miss2005, watched early 2000s teen movies like “A Cinderella Story” and “John Tucker Must Die.”","image":"y2kteens-2","image_ext":"jpg","image_caption":"","image_credit":"Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times"},{"p":"","image":"y2kteens-3","image_ext":"jpg","image_caption":"","image_credit":"Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times"},{"p":"“When I saw these TV shows when I was little, I was like, ‘I can’t wait to grow up and be just like that,’ I saw those characters as what I wanted to be,” she said. Movies and shows about teenage life today, she said, are too dark and depressing."},{"p":"By the time Nicole entered her teenage years, the world had been upended by smartphones and social media. The culture was radically different. “The early 2000s were all about having fun and expressing your individuality. In today’s world, everything and everyone is taken so seriously,” said Nicole."},{"p":"She yearns for the days when in-person communication and phone calls ruled the world. “I hate how technology ruined face to face communication. It was so much better in the 2000s,” she said. “Technology keeps evolving and keeps taking over our lives. The movie ‘Smart House’ in 1999, I think, was a <span id='youtubesmarthouse'>warning</span> about how technology could ruin your life, and I really think that happened.”","footnotes":[{"id":"youtubesmarthouse","h":"","by":"","type":"small","paragraphs":[{"p":"","embed_id":"youtube_smarthouse"}],"fig_number":3}]},{"p":"Today, she has completely transformed her bedroom in Pleasantville, N.Y. into a period-specific replica of an early 2000s teen’s room.

She brushes on glittery eye shadow called “Rich Girl,” quite possibly an ode to Paris Hilton, and plumps her lips with pink gloss. Other <span id='youtubenicole1'>videos</span> feature a tour of her CD collection, an early 2000s clothing haul, information on how to turn a pink Motorola flip phone into a fashion accessory, and advice for viewers on “20 ways you can relive the early 2000s.”","image":"y2kteens-4","image_ext":"jpg","image_caption":"","image_credit":"Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times","footnotes":[{"id":"youtubenicole1","h":"Nicole Randone’s videos","by":"","type":"small","paragraphs":[{"p":"","embed_id":"youtube_nicolemorning"},{"p":"","embed_id":"youtube_nicolecd"},{"p":"","embed_id":"youtube_nicoleclothing"},{"p":"","embed_id":"youtube_nicolemotorola"},{"p":"","embed_id":"youtube_nicolerelive"}],"fig_number":4}]},{"p":"Listening to “old” music and running an Instagram account are simply ways to feel more connected to life in the early aughts. “I don’t listen to any music from today, everything is early 2000s for me,” Nicole said. “I don’t like Spotify. I listen to CDs on my pink radio. Everyone teases me for it but it makes me feel connected to the early 2000s.”"},{"p":"Though she owns a Motorola flip phone, Nicole still mostly relies on her iPhone to connect with her equally 2000s-obsessed friends.
