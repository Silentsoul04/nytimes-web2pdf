Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/bernie-sanders.html}{Bernie
Sanders} of Vermont, former mayor
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/michael-bloomberg.html}{Michael
R. Bloomberg} of New York and Senator
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/elections/amy-klobuchar.html}{Amy
Klobuchar} of Minnesota had the most speaking time of the seven
Democratic presidential candidates in the debate in Charleston, S.C.,
ahead of the South Carolina primary on Saturday.

Electability, foreign policy, gun control and racial justice were major
topics during the debate. The candidates also sparred over Russian
election interference, housing discrimination and each other's
legislative record.

Note: The size of each circle represents the total length of a
candidate's responses to a topic.

Like last week's debate, the night was more heated than usual. Mr.
Bloomberg continued to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/19/us/politics/democratic-debate-nevada-recap.html}{come
under fire} for his billionaire status and treatment of women, and Mr.
Sanders's newfound position as clear front-runner
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/25/us/politics/south-carolina-debate-recap.html}{made
him a target} as well. Almost every candidate criticized Mr. Sanders in
the first 10 minutes of the debate, challenging his electability, health
care plan and record on gun control.

The night took a turn toward the chaotic when, after Ms. Klobuchar
challenged the math of Mr. Sanders's ``Medicare for all'' plan, there
was more than half a minute of sustained crosstalk among the candidates
as they tried to interrupt to make their points.

The increasing threat of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/25/world/asia/coronavirus-news.html}{spread
of the coronavirus} became a topic of debate for the first time, with
candidates criticizing the Trump administration's preparations for an
outbreak and Mr. Biden referring to the Obama administration's efforts
to combat the Ebola virus.
