Hanging out with King Princess can feel like entering a time warp. At
21, she has the lush, broken voice of a hard-living lounge singer in a
David Lynch film, and her music is similarly timeless: guitar-driven
torch songs with lyrics sharpened by what sounds like a thousand years
of love gone wrong. Listening to the yearning R\&B swoon of “Prophet” —
from King Princess’ debut album, “Cheap Queen” — you may imagine its
maker as a sad-eyed recluse, one who wears her sorrow like armor. But in
person — her birth name is Mikaela Straus — the singer comes off as a
different kind of throwback: a bawdy, trash-talking caricature of
old-school rock ’n’ roll excess.

In the time we spent together, I saw her mime masturbation after talking
about how hot she thinks the singer Rosalía is (“She gave me a hug, and
I was like, ‘You smell good.”); declare that if she were a man, she
would “have a small \[expletive\], but it would work good”; and announce
that she wants to give her girlfriend a cast of her vagina for their
anniversary. In between takes at the video shoot for “Ohio” — a
slow-burn ballad that descends into an unhinged rock jam — she asked
several members of her team to smell her armpits (noting that the left
one was noticeably more rank than the right) and talked colorful smack
about other artists, esteemed music-industry institutions and an
ex-girlfriend’s new girlfriend. “I want you to come to my apartment
after this,” she said, staring me down during a moment of tenuous calm
as her makeup artist sprayed a fine mist of glittering fuchsia across
her cheekbone, “because I can tell it’s inconvenient for you.” [Continue

How thrilling must it have been to be a young teenager in 2008,
witnessing the birth of Odd Future, a Los Angeles collective of skater
kids. They must have made it feel possible to do everything and be every
way you wanted to but weren’t sure was allowed. I was too old to be that
sort of fan when Odd Future dropped its first mix tape, but when I saw
Tyler Okonma — the rapper Tyler, the Creator ­— one of the collective’s
breakout stars, reclining on the couch of the reborn “Arsenio Hall Show”
a few years later, feet up, explaining a youthful worldview that was as
harebrained as it was shrewd, as unmannerly as it was undeniable, my
first thought was that I wish he had existed when I was teenager. I
needed him.

He was a force, eating cockroaches in music videos, fantasizing about
murder and suicide, delighting in hiding behind a veneer of edgelord
homophobic, misogynist lyrics. His was a youthful, playful, nearly
theoretical form of destruction. He reveled in blurring the line between
character and artist and troll, between ego and id. Yet he was so
sure-handed in his artistry, so unfettered, that he was precisely what
I, and probably you, could have used as a kid: someone who does not care
about anyone’s rules but seems such a genius that no one opposing him
could ever be taken seriously. Your parents can ground you; they can’t
do a thing to Tyler. Thus: He represented freedom. A grisly and dark
one, for sure, but a freedom nonetheless.

His growing up came in stages. On earlier albums like “Bastard” (2009)
and “Goblin” (2011), he is still thrilled by the unassailable powers of
potty mouth, enchanted by the possibility of scandalizing people in a
way that rap used to but hadn’t in years. On “Cherry Bomb” (2015) and
“Flower Boy” (2017), he’s thrilled by the power of music itself, and
perhaps by the power of success, too. On “Flower Boy,” in particular, he
is writing about a male lover — plot twist\! — and is now brimming with
questions about life and love, beauty and bees. The
annoying-little-brother skater Tyler is certainly still in the building,
but quite often his inclusion feels like an afterthought, a decision
made in post­production, a conciliation to the fans that stop him at Six
Flags and ask for pictures in hopes of validating their own flagging
youth.

Then comes [last year’s
“IGOR,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/07/arts/music/tyler-the-creator-igor-kevin-abstract-arizona-baby-review.html)
and it’s an entirely different game. For many longtime Tyler fans, the
album felt like an insult: Where are the bars, the bangers, the middle
fingers? But as anyone doing a close reading of Tyler’s discography
knows, the real “IGOR” was with us all along. Here the production
wizardry and pure musicality he explored on “Flower Boy” meets the
earnestness of “Cherry Bomb.” And the fact that the man who once rhymed
“Aretha” with “urethra” had now made an entire album about one single
breakup? Well, that’s the biggest middle finger to anyone missing the
old Tyler.

All this was brought into vivid relief on the album’s first and only
single, “Earf­quake,” anchored by a pop-friendly three-chord
progression, vocals by the Gap Band legend Charlie Wilson and a verse
from the rapper Playboi Carti delivered so breezily as to almost be a
parody of a Playboi Carti verse. Tyler later admitted that he originally
wrote it for Justin Bieber or Rihanna, both of whom passed before he
took it himself. The Gap Band influence is strong: You can easily
superimpose Tyler’s chorus over the verse chords from one of its biggest
hits, “Outstanding” (1982), and Wilson’s influential voice technique —
later imitated by the likes of Keith Sweat and Aaron Hall of Guy — is
present here, in a telescopic callback to the late ’80s New Jack Swing
he helped inspire.

For me though, what hits hardest about “Earf­quake” is that Tyler
presents a version of himself with no room to spare. The song, like much
of the album, finds him at a loss. He has ditched the safety of youthful
disaffection to seek love and some version of earnestness — but,
surprise, it hurts. Such is the cost of genuinely trying to care. “Don’t
leave,” he begs, “it’s my fault.” This is a Tyler without an answer. The
certainty is gone, replaced with pleading. He is refreshingly, if
painfully, not in control. We’ve already heard angry Tyler, swaggering
Tyler, depressive and violent Tyler, double-middle-finger Tyler and
I’m-too-smart-for-all-this Tyler. “Earf­quake” is the first time we
hear a Tyler in need of someone else. The ground beneath his feet has
indeed been shaken.

This pop-fueled exploration into genuine vulnerability — not in the
sense of baring all, but in the sense of being open to being harmed —
has reached a broader audience than any of Tyler’s other work ever has.
“IGOR” was the first No.1 album of his decade-plus career; it netted
him a Grammy. Musically, production-wise, it’s his most skilled
creation, and literarily it’s his most completely thought-through. It
can’t be everyone’s favorite. But since his first solo effort in 2009,
Tyler has gone from hating himself to loving himself to loving someone
else — with all the destruction and emotional detritus that brings. I
can’t think of a better definition of growing up than that.

<span class="g-summary">The solo star evolves teen pop — into the 1970s.
<span class="g-arrow"></span> By Lindsay Zoladz</span> It’s almost
unprecedented to see all the former members of a boy band vie for a solo
career at once, but One Direction was always different. Niall Horan,
Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne have tuned their respective antennas to
what they believe makes a pop hit these days: aping Ed Sheeran, a duet
with the hitmaker Bebe Rexha or a bad-boy-by-numbers approach. But their
former bandmate Harry Styles, the one people over 30 would recognize on
the street, has elected to make what you’d almost have to call
baby-boomer music. He cites Van Morrison, Steely Dan and Joni Mitchell
as his influences; he dresses like Mick Jagger circa “Exile on Main
Street.” And he made last year’s [“Fine
Line,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/23/arts/music/harry-styles-fine-line-billboard.html)

a throwback to album-rock days that has somehow become a streaming-era
hit.

You can see why “Adore You” became the album’s defining single: It’s the
one in which past and present coalesce most seamlessly, its playful
psychedelia streamlined into sleek modern hit-making. It lets Styles
show off the full, androgynous range of his voice: The ethereal high
note he hits in the chorus is the equivalent of the sheer Gucci blouse
he wore to last year’s Met Gala. Styles has the cross-platform
popularity to take some risks in his music — and in a world hyperfocused
on the next big thing, he’s managed to repurpose the past to become a
new kind of star.

Brittany Howard, progeny of Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Prince and owner
of all genres, took herself to the proverbial woodshed (in this case a
greenhouse in Topanga, Calif.) and made a black-queer-Southern-feminist
debut solo album that rings up Meshell Ndegeocello’s “Bitter” from the
future. Named after her big sister, who, before she died of a rare eye
cancer at 13, gave Howard the best tools a big sister might — poetry and
sound — “Jaime” feels like that elusive and mystical other side of
grief, where tears, no longer happy or sad but something much greater
and far more satisfying, surprise and amuse.

Heretofore known as the luminous frontwoman of [the blues-rock band
Alabama
Shakes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/03/22/magazine/alabama-shakess-soul-stirring-shape-shifting-new-sound.html),
Howard has been lionized by Southerners and non-Southerners alike as the
region’s radically reconstructed blues woman, its weird, funky rock
savior and an emblem of a South that might finally see promiscuity and
difference — racial, sexual, sonic — as a liberal good. Howard herself
has palpably resisted this role and its box, in part by genre-hopping
from garage rock to Americana in the groups Thunderbitch and Bermuda
Triangle. On
[“Jaime,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/05/arts/music/brittany-howard-jaime.html)
this resistance appears effortless, intimate, self-evident and interior.

Here, Howard models luscious generosity toward herself as a woman,
lover, Southerner, daughter and sister, modes of being that spread to
every crevice of the album. She deftly guides her voice — a divine,
soaring, hand-to-hand, declarative, love-soaked instrument only made
more expansive in service of herself and her sound alone — through the
varying registers of the blues. [Continue

Is romance dead? If you listen to the radio or scroll through a

women in his songs with entreaties and worshipful words, venerating love
itself as a kind of holy force — a deity that beams golden light down
through the skylight and into the boudoir.

Santos’s old-fashioned passions are displayed to greatest effect in the
songs in which he pines for lost loves. “El Beso Que No Le Di,” a duet
with Kiko Rodriguez, is one of those: a melodrama about a jilted lover
who attends the wedding of his ex. Over a typically sensuous bachata
arrangement — floating melody, jittery guitar line, chattering bongos
and guiro — the singers take turns, but it is Santos who commands center
stage: His voice, a falsetto pitched somewhere between Aaron Neville and
a chirruping bluebird, is one of pop’s great sounds. The song is a
lament about “the kiss that I didn’t give,” but Santos, a child of
hip-hop, has a way of slipping in boasts alongside his plaints. “She
won’t forget Romeo,” he coos. “Unh-unh.”

</div>

<div class="g-body">

The lyrics may prompt a chuckle — Taylor Swift, cool? — but the
aggravation behind them is palpable: “Complex” is a descriptor
journalists toss hither-and-yon at male musicians but apply sparingly to
the likes of Swift.

<div class="g-line-fg">

The song’s most hard-hitting line is a plaintive rhetorical question
that calls to mind a \#MeToo movement slogan: \#BelieveWomen.

As a lyricist, Swift’s great strength is storytelling. But “The Man”
turns on a punchline that calls to mind the pun-happy pros of
Nashville’s Music Row, where Swift cut her teeth as a songwriter.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-body">

In recent years, Swift’s “power moves” have extended to the eternal
music-industry struggle between labor and management: She has squared
off with Spotify about royalties and clashed with record executives over
control of her masters.

<div class="g-body">

Maybe “The Man” is best seen as an update of Swift’s earlier smash
“Shake It Off.” Where that hit deflected sexist slights with cheeky
humor and passive-aggressive musical pep, Swift has — like so many women
in this era — embraced something more robust: the power of anger without
apology.

arguably the biggest star in Afrobeats, a catchall term for the plush,

range from come-ons and braggadocio to forays into politics and protest.

This big hit, named for the billionaire industrialist Aliko Dangote, may
at first appear to be a straightforward boast: Burna Boy touting his
industriousness and indefatigable drive to “find money.” But the return,
again and again, to the figure of Dangote — and the catalog of other
Nigerian tycoons and politicians invoked in the song’s coda — suggests a
more ambivalent message. Burna Boy is describing a system that elevates
a lucky few to positions of unimaginable wealth and leaves millions
scraping and scrambling. The video, with its images of working-class
Lagos, sides with the masses. But ultimately the song is reportorial: a
dispatch from a pitiless world in which that refrain — “Dangote,
Dangote” — functions as both a striver’s mantra and a yelp of despair.

One-two-three *four* … one-two-three *four* … — at least that’s how I
count out the opening riff of “953,” a brazen statement of purpose from
the guitarist and singer Geordie Greep, pictured, off black midi’s 2019
debut album, “Schlagenheim.” Or I tap it out on the desk: thumb, index,
pinkie, ring … thumb, index, pinkie, ring. Four big notes and two little
ghost notes, making up a riff that clambers over the beginning and end
of the song. A minute in, they do something similar, except now they
make that last beat stretch and hang in the air as if time has stopped,
and a whole song’s worth of drumming seems to crowd in.

It sounds like proof of life in our digitized and automated world,
orchestrated by four curious whelps from Britain trying to break music
off its perfect mechanical grid and into unpredictable, imperfect
spaces.

The band’s name comes from a niche genre of music that exists almost
exclusively on the internet. A “black MIDI” song — the genre, not the
band — is one with so many notes, crammed so tightly into composing
software, that the staff becomes one thick black line, darkened with
[millions or billions of
notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUy8vnZLwhk). The musicians and
programmers who create this are called blackers, and their work sounds
like a legion of grand pianos at war inside an unusually crowded Dave &
Busters. This is part avant-garde process music, part one-upmanship,
part stress test on what a song can contain and what will happen when a
computer can’t handle it anymore. The song “Armageddon v3,” by Gingeas,
consists of a single note repeated 93 trillion times and is definitely
unplayable on your laptop, unless you have 256 terabytes of hard-drive
space lying around.

The band black midi doesn’t share many aesthetics with this stuff, but
there’s something apt to the name, a puckish appetite for disruption.
The four musicians came together as teenagers at the BRIT School for
Performing Arts and Technology in London, making wiry, odd songs born
out of a boundless Gen Z curiosity; they’re filled with long
improvisations and impressionist lyrics that suggest there’s more life
in the underbelly of a moneyed city than there could ever be on its
gilded surface. “953” is particularly experimental: Its time signature
shifts constantly, from a light-speed onslaught to a relaxed, cavernous
crawl and then back. By the end, the band repeats its opening riff while
steadily slowing the tempo with impossible precision, like a clock
winding down.

Between Morgan Simpson’s [cephalopodic
drumming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMn1UuEIVvA) and Greep’s
ancient croon, the band does have a mathy, prog-rock air — but in place
of the pretensions normally associated with hyper­technical music, black
midi has a kind of pathos. Here they are in this computational age,
building whole songs around human uncertainty, songs that keep fidgeting
and breathing, even when they’re only repeating a few handfuls of notes.
The music’s code is so restless, so elastic, that it resists
classification; it hides from the algorithm. Music like this can be a
respite from our increasingly mechanized soundscape, smoothed out by
Zamboni­like digital tools that ensure tempos never vary and nothing is
out of place.

The way music reaches its listeners is becoming increasingly opaque,
too, policed by a computational process that has redefined the spaces in
which we listen to and share songs. There are now, literally, hidden
proprietary digital codes that shape the way music is distributed and
ranked, and we are being conditioned to view their effects as an
accurate measurement of the world — to assume that the most-streamed
song must be the most popular one, even when we are clueless about the
source of the underlying data.

But that grand rubato at the end of “953,” the riff becoming slower and
slower by pure feel — that’s something that feels untouched by a
machine. These four guys pushed this dented jalopy of a song to its
breaking point, and now it’s sputtering out on those four notes,
one-two-three *four* … one-two-three *four*. … This small and simple
line of code programs into the song a high possibility of being omitted
from big popular playlists because it is neither clean nor harmonious.
It suggests something both obvious and inevitable: In a genre­less
future, alternative music won’t be a response to what is popular — but
an attack on the computational nature of music itself.

But Ingram is also 21, just a few months older than Lil Nas X. What does

He just started connecting a little bit of then to little bits of now.
The connection made that night in his ferocious, flabbergasting
instrumental dismount was between Prince and “Old Town Road.” He didn’t
give it the novelty treatment, two bars then onto the next; he stayed
there and made love to that song as if it had been around for half a
century, as if he were conceived to it. Suddenly, it was “Hotel
California,” “Stairway to Heaven.” Meaty, serious, canonical.

<div class="g-slide__content-inner">

“Cats” is a vast and expanding ecosystem, comprising a stage show, a
cast album, a fandom and now a quasi flop of a blockbuster film. This
latest reworking, which came out last December, repeats the original
plot of the show: A group of urbane and world-weary cats compete in an
annual talent show for a chance to ascend to the Heaviside Layer, a
vaguely defined yet enticing afterworld. This premise does little to
justify itself, which is but one of the many charms of “Cats.”

Even in a time of so much cultural recursion — of news about memes based
on tweets about news — the show amounts to something uniquely dense and
strange. Last year’s film neglected this fact, to its great detriment.
“Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats,” the overture from the movie and
the show, tells the whole of this tale in microcosm.

It begins as many music stories do, with a white person imitating a
white person imitating a black person. In the 1930s, the poets Ezra
Pound and T.S. Eliot wrote letters, channeling the voice of Joel
Chandler Harris, who was channeling the fake black dialect of Uncle
Remus. In those days, such banter was called “modernism.” Eliot
repackaged the bit as a collection of light verse, which was published
in 1939 as “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats.”

Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, the English composer, first came to know this
book as a child. He returned to the text in 1977, translating the
lighthearted verses into song as a diversion during rehearsals for
“Evita.” What emerged from that whim was a rarefied “song cycle,”
scored word for word to Eliot’s poems. This work birthed the stage
musical, which ran on Broadway for 18 years straight — finding a
mainstream audience despite, or perhaps because of, its unlikely
premise.

“Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats” is the first and strangest song in
this very strange show. One of just a few not scored to Eliot’s verse,
it turns on a tautological refrain: “Jellicles can and jellicles do\!
Jellicles do and jellicles can\!” These Jellicle cats are the show’s
only stars, but we come to know them only through oblique interrogation:
“Are you blind when you’re born? Can you see in the dark?” Jellicles
are, and jellicles can. They run up walls and walk on wires. They were
present for the construction of the Sphinx, but beyond this, “jellicle”
is not clearly defined. Part of the pleasure of falling into “Cats” is
letting Webber guide you imperceptibly toward knowledge. Like many great
avant-garde works, “Jellicle” teaches you to understand itself.

In the [original cast
recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbpP3Sxp-1U), the music does
as much educating as the lyrics. The song begins in a dark alleyway,
where textured horns seem to steal between shadows. The blink of a
xylophone’s dissonant chords suggests a pair of yellow cat eyes in the
night — and further suggests the show’s classic poster. This combination
of music and sensual, not-quite-camp feline dance made “Cats” the
longest-running show of its time, shattering records on both Broadway
and the West End. The dancing cats formed their suicide cult more than
16,000 times throughout the era, as busloads of tourists arrived to
watch them die. The show’s T-shirt was a best seller of the ’80s, second
only to merch from the Hard Rock Cafe. That a cat-themed stage
extravaganza — written by a dense modernist and channeled through song
and dance without any narration — could find the same appeal as rock ’n’
roll-themed chain restaurants is among the most unlikely art stories
ever told.

With this in mind, it makes perfect sense that infinitely regurgitative
Hollywood would think to adapt [“Cats” into a
movie](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/18/movies/cats-review.html).
Even as reboots go, the intellectual-property behemoth seems uniquely
suited to our time: absurdist, nostalgic, a pastiche of different genres
starring the internet’s lead protagonist. In a time of much debate on
what a blockbuster should be, the success of “Cats” onstage provides
compelling evidence that the middlebrow public will show up for things
that challenge the least common denominator. The movie could have done
as much — but it failed.

The latest version of “Jellicle” seems afraid of everything that made
the old version work. In place of spacious trumpets, the alleyway floods
with synthesized, digitally echoed pianos. Instead of the allusion to
the blinking yellow eyes, the song opts for what sound like actual
recordings of cats’ paws. The cats in the original Broadway cast album
channeled the voices of stereotypical 19th-century eccentrics: the
faded, screeching hag; the foppish, mincing lush; the booming, bombastic
man about town. In the movie, the singers sound as smooth and
radio-ready as Jason Derulo. (Indeed, one character is Jason Derulo.)
This flat trepidation carries over to the visuals, in which felinity was
so overexpressed that the cast looked disturbing, somehow both fully
human and fully cat. The film, in other words, does not believe that its
mass audience can synthesize strangeness. It struggles to explain the
weird world it conjures, thus not ascending to the Heaviside Layer but
landing with a thud in the litter box of culture, kicking up a cloud
that quickly settles into nothing.

Denzel Curry, who released his first mixtape at 16, has always projected
wisdom beyond his years. Now 25, the rapper from Carol City, Fla., is a
veteran, and on “Ricky” he sounds the part: exulting over his success,
repping his home turf and delivering life lessons in a voice of
authority.

The titular Ricky is Curry’s father. Many songwriters pay tribute to
family and formative years, but few gaze backward, as Curry does, with a
fondness devoid of sentimentality:

> My daddy said: “Trust no man but your brothers”  
> “And never leave your day ones in the gutter”  
> My daddy said: “Treat young girls like your mother”  
> My momma said: “Trust no ho, use a rubber.”

Curry’s life has been marked by death — he was a classmate of Trayvon
Martin’s, his brother died after being tasered by the police and his old
roommate, the rapper XXXTentacion, was killed in 2018.

Curry is one of the inventors of woozy-sounding SoundCloud rap, but
“Ricky” is a classicist move: a hard, unfussy beat; tidy rhymes;
brisk, vivid storytelling reminiscent of old-school heroes such as Tupac
and Ice Cube. Like many songs on the superb 2019 album “ZUU,” “Ricky” is
short, just 2 minutes 27 seconds — but Curry has the wit, and the soul,
to pull off brevity.

At the beginning of the video for “Motivation,” a girl settles in front
of a television tuned to BET’s defunct show “106 & Park.” The hosts
introduce “the No. 1 video in the world right now: Normani\!” The scene
is full of nostalgia for the recent past, from the bulky TV to the white
text in the corner of the screen listing the video’s directors, Dave
Meyers and Daniel Russell. That spirit inhabits the
video-within-the-video too.

The schoolyard where Normani dances evokes Britney Spears’s “…Baby One
More Time” (1998). Her tank top and commanding strut recall Beyoncé’s
“Crazy in Love” (2003). And if the basketball court you see reminds
you of Jennifer Lopez and Ja Rule’s “I’m Real (Remix)” (2001), that’s no
coincidence. It’s the same court and the same director: Dave Meyers. All
three of those videos were released before Normani, who was raised in
New Orleans and Houston, turned 7.

The song itself is a sunny early-aughts reverie, breaking through the
depressive haze of contemporary pop radio. Recently there has been a
surge in ’90s-born stars nodding to the musical touchstones of their
youth. A new single from Ariana Grande incorporated a verse from NSYNC;
the R\&B artist Summer Walker samples an early Usher hit on her current
single — and also got him to perform a duet with her. Like
[“Motivation,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKXSh14svlQ) these
songs belong to a new generation of female idols, fast on their way to
becoming the inspiration for the next wave of nostalgic pop stars.

Do people have less tolerance these days for moral ambiguity in art?
That’s certainly the sense you get from the going conversations about it
— not just those parts where reactionaries rail against the death of
artistic freedom at the hands of puritanical wokesters, but also those
parts where people welcome moral engagement with the art they consume.

Do people have less tolerance these days for moral ambiguity in art?
That’s certainly the sense you get from the going conversations about it
— not just those parts where reactionaries rail against the death of
artistic freedom at the hands of puritanical wokesters, but also those
parts where people welcome moral engagement with the art they consume.
“We’re talking less about whether a work is good art but simply
whether it’s good,” the New York Times critic Wesley Morris
[wrote](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2018/10/03/magazine/morality-social-justice-art-entertainment.html)
in 2018. “Good for us, good for the culture, good for the world.”

Artists plainly sense that they need to be more careful about what they
say and depict, as comedians are constantly complaining; even fans
exercise caution, acknowledging which of their enthusiasms are
“problematic faves,” ethical splotches marring the purity of their
taste.

We talk about this new mode of cultural consumption constantly, but it’s
unclear exactly how real it actually is. Certainly, there’s no risk that
all art will be bowdlerized into nice stories about people saving
puppies, but it’s not wrong to note a fading appetite for antiheroes and
bad behavior. What is clear is that there is at least one exception, an
artist who breathes easily in this atmosphere: Lana Del Rey. And the
greatest proof that she isn’t subject to the anxieties governing her
peers came last year, when her cover of Sublime’s 1997 single [“Doin’
Time”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3ypeugNzYA) became inescapable,
ubiquitous, the alternative song of the summer.

This made some obvious sense: “Doin’ Time” is a breezy seasonal anthem,
built on a sample of Herbie Mann’s version of DuBose Heyward and George
Gershwin’s “Summertime.” But it also made no sense, because the song
tells a story we’re supposedly loath to hear. Our narrator’s girlfriend
“spreads her lovin’ all over” but declines to sleep with him, so he
masturbates grimly and then confesses to murderous desire: “I’d like to
hold her head underwater.” It’s a portrait of male discontent, an incel
ballad. It was also a widely lauded single on the most critically
acclaimed album of Del Rey’s career. And vanishingly few people bothered
to cluck about that, or to mention the lyrics at all.

The selective silence was similar when Del Rey’s album arrived in late
summer and listeners began quoting their favorite lyrics, especially
lines from the opening track. “Goddamn man-child,” they tweeted, or
“Your poetry’s bad and you blame the news.” These were revealing
choices: Del Rey isn’t using the title track to humiliate a sad-sack
partner. She’s bemoaning the way she remains in thrall to him. It’s just
that the lines in which she acknowledges her powerlessness — “Why wait
for the best when I could have you?” — tended to produce less intense
reactions. Even on websites full of young women joking about the
sometimes-humiliating condition of being attracted to uninspiring young
men, there seemed to be something less appealing about publicly
embracing those lines.

Del Rey has portrayed herself in thrall to shadowy, unpleasant men since
the start of her career. At the beginning of the decade, when Beyoncé
was singing about girls running the world and pop stars were obsessed
with empowerment, Del Rey was crooning that “My old man is a bad man.
... He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart” and that “Heaven
is a place on Earth where you tell me all the things you want to do.”
Her 2012 debut ended with the song “This Is What Makes Us Girls” — the
definition being “We don’t stick together, cause we put love first.” By
2014’s album
[“Ultraviolence,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/06/15/arts/music/lana-del-rey-still-stirs-things-up-with-ultraviolence.html)
she added a darker layer: Along with songs like “Pretty When You Cry”
and “\[Expletive\] My Way Up to the Top,” the album quoted the infamous
Crystals song “He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss).”

Yet Del Rey is popular in precisely the young-and-righteous demographic
that would supposedly scold an artist into oblivion for this sort of
thing. It helps, surely, that we know Del Rey can’t possibly be the
person she is in her songs: That person lives in an alternate dimension
in which the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s, Hollywood and Vegas, pinups and
“Lolita,” are all crushed together into a context-free mood board of
picturesque references and familiar phrases. Last year, Del Rey
responded to an essay by the critic Ann Powers with a tweet: “Never had
a persona. Never needed one. Never will.” But this is like a magician’s
insisting the magic tricks are real. It’s also exactly what Del Rey’s
persona would say.

We can’t have a “real” relationship with this fantasy, this construct.
And that has left Del Rey with the freedom to dramatize all the
less-photogenic emotions that have enthralled her fans: self-abasement,
self-destructiveness, moony romanticism, the appeal of someone else’s
power. A friend told me that, for her, Del Rey captures how confused
sexuality and longing are, partly because her songs are so melodramatic
that they relieve the tension inherent in craving things like submission
or pain. And in doing so, she has created space for a new generation of
’90s-inflected pop stars — like, say, Billie Eilish — to plumb
complicated feelings. The path Del Rey has walked isn’t necessarily that
hard to follow: Just reject the modish turn toward authenticity, toward
a carefully curated “openness” with fans. It’s far more difficult to
condemn someone when nothing — not her songs, not her profiles, not even
her Instagram feed — gives you a clue as to who that someone is.

To have a No. 1 pop song, even in these more-algorithmic-than-rhythmic
times, is still a huge deal. The No. 1 spot determines cultural
coverage, appearance fees, venue sizes. No. 1 signals to talk-show and
festival bookers that an artist is enjoyed by fans across race and
gender borders. No. 1 is a knee in the gut of lax awards juries. And for
black artists? No. 1 means the “mainstream” *really* enjoys your music.

For black women, it means you have joined a superheroic clique that
includes the Shirelles, Little Eva, the Dixie Cups, Diana Ross (with and
without the Supremes), Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin and Gladys
Knight. Gloria Gaynor, Deniece Williams and Tina Turner. Brandy Norwood,
Monica Arnold, Toni Braxton, Ciara Harris, TLC, Lauryn Hill and Alicia
Keys. Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson. Donna Summer and Whitney Houston.
Robyn Rihanna Fenty. Beyoncé Knowles-Carter (with and without Destiny’s
Child). Cardi B. And now Melissa Viviane Jefferson — better known as
Lizzo.

Her 2017 song “Truth Hurts” became a viral hit in 2019 via a Netflix
soundtrack, TikTok and tidal waves of radio play, eventually spending
seven weeks at the top of Billboard’s Hot 100. “Truth” is a deeply cute
bop, a taunt, a million middle fingers atwirl at fear and heartbreak.
Lizzo has given late credit to the songwriter Mina Lioness for using a
Lioness tweet in the song, but “Truth” is about more than being “100
percent that bitch.” When Lizzo singsongs, “You coulda had a bad
bitch/Noncommittal/Help you with your career/Just a little,” I hear
Lauryn Hill chanting, “You might win some/But you just lost one.” That
line, from Hill’s 1998 “Lost Ones,” is one of the most satisfying chin
checks in pop history — and “Truth Hurts” is right in its ring.

[\[Diary of a Song: Watch Lizzo Make
'Juice.'\]](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/video/arts/music/100000006417770/lizzo-juice.html)

Lizzo’s song glows with the fury of the big black women in pop’s past.
Black pop subtexts — that tension you feel in even the happiest of big
black records — often function as a counterbalance for historical
undervaluation, and “Truth” can be heard as payback for the erasure and
exploitation of singers like Martha Wash. In the mid-1970s, Wash began
her career in a backup duo with Izora Armstead called Two Tons o’ Fun.
Renamed the Weather Girls, they were Grammy-nominated for their 1982
classic “It’s Raining Men.” When Wash re-emerged as an in-demand session
singer, her demo and background vocals were used as lead vocals —
without permission or proper payment.

At one point Wash was suing three different labels for, variously,
fraud, deceptive packaging, unauthorized use of her voice and commercial
appropriation, including on Seduction’s [“(You’re My One and Only) True
Love”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IBJlUWDy9c); Black Box’s
[“Everybody Everybody”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18N2k1TBBRE);
and C & C Music Factory’s [“Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance
Now).”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaTGrV58wec) That’s Wash
singing the words “everybody,” “dance” and “now.”

“Sweat” was on the pop charts for six months, and for two weeks in 1991
it was the No. 1 song in America. In the video, the lithe singer Zelma
Davis lip-synced Wash’s vocals. In the video for “Everybody Everybody,”
the model Katrin Quinol mouthed Wash’s work. Wash’s cases were settled
out of court, even as her battle set in motion federal legislation
mandating proper vocal credits. She never got her Lizzo moment — her own
No. 1.

“The vocals that I did are my vocals,” Wash said on the news show “A
Current Affair” in 1991. “This is my career. This is my life.” Insult
was added to injury when C & C Music Factory’s Freedom Williams said in
the same episode, “I don’t mean to be rude, harsh, callous or maligning
or vilifying,” and then just said it out loud: “but I’d rather look at
Zelma onstage.”

Got it. So when Lizzo raps, “We don’t \[expletive\] with lies, we don’t
do goodbyes/We just keep it pushing like/Aye yi yi,” the message feels
like “Hi, I’m Wash’s lawyer/We demand she be credited and paid/So please
govern yourself accordingly.” My body mass index quivers to “Aye yi yi”
joyously, every single time.

The line from Wash to Lizzo connects through the singer-songwriter Kelly
Price, who helped lift the Notorious B.I.G.’s 1997 No. 1 [“Mo Money Mo
Problems”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUhRKVIjJtw) to immortality
with her chorus: “I don’t know/What they want from me/It’s like the more
money we come across/The more problems we see.” Price did appear in the
video — in a small box, visible only from the shoulders up.

Sixteen years later, Price, on the red carpet for the “R\&B Divas: Los
Angeles” premiere, said she was pitching a reality-TV show called “Too
Fat for Fame.” “How much good singing, dancing, entertaining, acting do
you think the world has missed out on,” Price asked, “because somebody
was told, ‘No, because you’re too big’?”

And then here comes Lizzo. Body too big. Personality too big. Talent too
much. Audacity so consistent. Talking about living out of her car. About
not feeling bad about feeling good. Setting the social streets afire by
wearing her ass literally out, courtside at Staples Center. In the music
video for “Truth Hurts,” Lizzo’s lush bits nearly fall from ivory
lingerie. She rocks her heft like a safety pin through her lip.

Who’s gon’ stop a black woman from rap-singing from a place where pain
hardens to growth, and tears rise steaming? We tend to uplift a black
woman who works out her blues publicly, to a melody. When black girls
perform, we dance. We karaoke. Everybody screams, “Goals\!” God bless
Lizzo for pulling up to pop culture big, loud and stomping. God forbid
the black woman in the next cubicle speak a hurting truth in her indoor
voice, though. On behalf of herself. To power. Or about anything else
that matters.

<span class="g-summary">It’s not easy to write the exceedingly normal.
<span class="g-arrow"></span> By Nitsuh Abebe</span> Even for an obscure
independent artist, Richard Dawson does not make things easy on himself.
You could almost describe him as a tender English folk singer, but he’s
far too steeped in experimental music for that to work. The poignancy in
his records tends to emerge from songs that can be raw, even slightly
grotesque, laced with earthy rattles and croaks and dissonances. The
music he writes is precisely the sort of searching, ambitious stuff we
all say artists should attempt, then make awkward faces about when one
tries. One running joke about his 2017 masterpiece, “Peasant,” was how
hard it was to recommend to friends: “Uh, yeah, it’s an entire album
about ... characters living in the north of England ... in the Dark
Ages?” <span class="g-cta">Read more</span>

Even for an obscure independent artist, Richard Dawson does not make
things easy on himself. You could almost describe him as a tender
English folk singer, but he’s far too steeped in experimental music for
that to work. The poignancy in his records tends to emerge from songs
that can be raw, even slightly grotesque, laced with earthy rattles and
croaks and dissonances. The music he writes is precisely the sort of
searching, ambitious stuff we all say artists should attempt, then make
awkward faces about when one tries. One running joke about his 2017
masterpiece, “Peasant,” was how hard it was to recommend to friends:
“Uh, yeah, it’s an entire album about ... characters living in the
north of England ... in the Dark Ages?”

So imagine when he returned with “2020,” a successor on which he applies
the same premise — songs about characters living in the north of England
— to the present day. Singing about weavers and beggars in pre-Norman
Britain at least fit the odd shapes of Dawson’s arrangements and let him
revel in poetic language, as when he described a settlement as [“a dice
of houses cast with clay and sheep
dung,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaW-yD7DoA) emerging through
“a soup of starlit peat smoke.” The present won’t accept any of that
stuff. On “2020” he’s writing in plain language about shipping-center
managers and U.F.O. sightings and “the guy from the vape shop.” All of
this risks terrific awkwardness. But if you believe in music’s ability
to speak frankly about how we live together, it’s exactly the right
challenge — and if “2020” doesn’t sound as good as “Peasant,” maybe it
will 1,500 years from now.

Throughout “2020,” Dawson manages to wring huge emotion from the
extremely ordinary. A [red-faced soccer
dad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkSvn23fbAg), driving his child
home from a poor performance, swallows his disappointment and lets the
kid choose dinner; pub owners are surprised to find neighbors helping to
save the place from flooding; a homeless man listens to children’s
laughter as he nods off at a chicken joint. It’s difficult to pin down
what it is about Dawson’s performances that makes these things so richly
affecting — my money’s either on the slow winding of his mournful
melodies or the bellowing mournful-bear quality of his voice — but the
ultimate effect is that he feels more humane than almost anything else
on offer.

“Recently I’ve been struggling with anxiety,” begins the album’s first
single, “Jogging,” after a flurry of lumbering power chords. The
characters in these songs manage to be studiously gender-neutral, but
Dawson has let slip in interviews that he pictures this one as a woman.
Cut loose from her job as a school counselor, she does freelance
graphic-design work and fears leaving her flat; she senses judging eyes
on the bus, imagines buskers slipping cuss words into “Wonderwall” as
she passes. “I know I must be paranoid,” she says, but as the song
proceeds you consider that she may not be. She lives against a backdrop
of austerity, social-service cuts, gig-economy torpor and post-Brexit
nativism. The Kurdish family downstairs had a brick thrown through their
window, and the police don’t seem to care. “I feel the atmosphere round
here is growing nastier,” she says. A doctor suggests beta blockers and
exercise, and she’s surprised to find herself running hundreds of miles,
the song lumbering and trudging along with her.

The great gut punches in Dawson’s songs are the moments where people
seem to care about one another on levels more visceral than any love
song ever claims. Many involve parents and children, but there’s an odd
turn at the end of “Jogging” that has the same raw emotional pull. As
the song soars up to a climax, the narrator suddenly switches to direct
address: “Would you like to sponsor me for running the London Marathon?”
she asks. “Though it’s really daunting, we’re aiming to raise a thousand
pounds for the British Red Cross.” Running, it seems, hasn’t just helped
this person physically; it has become an avenue for her to do one small,
plodding thing to cut through the bad atmosphere and help someone else.
And the real gut punch is what this means for the rest of the story
we’ve just heard. Is it possible our anxious, shut-in jogger has been
pouring out all of this — the work history, the paranoia, the doctor’s
appointments, the Kurdish family — to some stranger, somewhere on a
doorstep or a park bench?

The archetypal pathway for American popular music runs from the sacred
to the profane, from gospel roots to secular pop. But some of music’s
biggest stars have traveled in the opposite direction. In 2019, Kanye
West — like Bob Dylan and Prince and many others before him — sought
refuge from fame (and infamy) in old-time religion, founding a gospel
group and releasing “Jesus Is King,” an album-length testimonial.

<div class="g-slide__verse" data-start="0" data-end="3.6">

###### \[Intro\]

<div class="g-line">

<div class="g-line-fg">

Father, I stretch --br-- Stretch my hands to You

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-body">

In “Follow God,” he is by turns a proselytizer and a penitent,
fulminating over a sample whose beseeching lyric echoes two earlier West
songs from 2016, “Father Stretch My Hands” Parts 1 and 2.

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-slide__verse" data-start="3.7" data-end="6.6">

###### \[Verse\]

<div class="g-line">

<div class="g-line-fg">

Not another word, letter, picture or a decimal --br-- Wrestlin’ with
God, I don’t really want to wrestle

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-body">

Beginning with early hits like “Jesus Walks” (2004), West’s songs have
cast him as a man caught in a tussle between God and mammon, a spasming
seeker prone to embracing false prophets — Donald Trump, yes, but also
the man in the mirror. It was less than a decade ago that West nicknamed
himself Yeezus and cheekily declared, “I am a god.”

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-slide__verse" data-start="6.7" data-end="14.3">

###### \[Outro\]

<div class="g-line">

<div class="g-line-fg">

Give him some advice, he starts spazzin’ on me --br-- I start spazzin’
back, he said, “That ain’t Christ-like” --br-- I said, “Aah\!”

</div>

</div>

<div class="g-body">

Kanye has never been a great pure M.C. His true form is the rant, those
moments — on record, onstage or online — when he stops rapping and gives
voice to his ego, superego and id. In the rant that closes “Follow God,”
he describes a conversation with his father. (Or is it God the Father?)
The song ends with Kanye letting out a shriek: a cry of pain, a howl of
spiritual ecstasy or — maybe, probably — both.

Ezra Koenig is the singer and primary songwriter for Vampire Weekend,
whose 2019 LP, “Father of the Bride,” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard
chart and won the Grammy for best alternative music album. I asked him
about how the album was frequently likened by critics — sometimes
favorably, sometimes not — to jam bands like the Grateful Dead and
Phish.

**In coverage of a song like “Harmony Hall,” there was a recurring theme
of “Vampire Weekend is being provocative by having these jam-band
signifiers. They’re being contrarian or they’re challenging the
audience.” Was that your intention?** To a large extent it was just
looking for what we thought was cool in the unfashionable pile. I
legitimately think that Phish are more inspiring, forward-thinking,
exciting and talented than a lot of what was higher up in the cool
hierarchy. There might have been stuff when I was 14 that I thought was
cooler than jam bands, for whatever reason. And then I just flipped.
It’s not my gut anymore. I’m familiar with a certain type of hierarchy
of cool. I know it. The artistic part of me just doesn’t buy it anymore.

Dylan Brady and Laura Les met in the St. Louis suburbs in 2012 and now
make manic music together as 100 gecs. They take the most flimsy and
tasteless signifiers of contemporary pop — processed vocals, dubstep
bass drops, trap high-hats, cheap synths, mall-punk yelps, ska’s
overeager bounce — and channel them into a brute-force electro-bubblegum
attack.

“stupid horse,” from their 2019 album [“1000
gecs,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/09/04/arts/music/100-gecs-review.html)
is pop intensified, a 220-volt current coursing through our 110-volt
brains. It is, in a word, extreme: The tempo is extremely fast, and the
melody is extremely catchy. The lyrics, about an equine-related caper
involving a sports car, are extremely absurd. They pitch the vocals
extremely high, and the ripping guitar solo — along with the uncanny
twirling “Whoo\!” that signals its launch — is extremely weird.

Those not on 100 gecs’ wavelength find them extremely annoying. “So this
is what music has come to?” is a common, and possibly intended,
response, leading to discussions about the warped tastes of digital
natives, about information overload and diminishing attention spans. But
this sort of provocation has a history. Those who are tuned into their
squiggly frequency, this writer included, hear in “stupid horse” a
connection to songs past where the joyful too-muchness of it all is the
whole point.

Here are five more in that ignoble lineage:

**Sleigh Bells** ****** *[“Tell ’Em”
(2010)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bSCZXKvUA)*

As Sleigh Bells, Alexis Krauss and the guitarist Derek Edward Miller
pushed the limits of gnarly guitar noise and perky singsong tunefulness.
It was an mp3 world, and hearing the impossibly distorted “Tell ’Em” for
the first time made you wonder if you had downloaded the wrong version.

**Party Animals** *[“Have You Ever Been Mellow”
(1995)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2er9d5hb_Fc)*

Happy hardcore was a zippy subgenre of rave that bounced around the
world at 170 beats per minute in the mid-1990s. The economy was good and
the drugs were better, which meant that a sped-up version of an Olivia
Newton-John hit reworked by Dutch producers could sell tens of thousands
of copies.

**Naked City** *[“Hellraiser”
(1990)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D12QW4sh1-k)*

100 gecs cite John Zorn’s band Naked City as an influence. On the
inhumanly fast and startlingly brief “Hellraiser,” they cycle between
grindcore (that ferocious triple-time variant of punk) and tasteful
supper-club jazz and back again in less than 45 seconds.

**Hot Butter** *[“Popcorn”
(1972)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK3ZP6frAMc)*

An oddball instrumental that hit the Top 10 in the U.S., its Moog-driven
arrangement sounded like the future. But what most people remember about
it is the weapons-grade infectiousness of its melody, which you’re
probably hearing in your head right now. (Sorry.)

**The Trashmen** *[“Surfin’ Bird”
(1963)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gc4QTqslN4)*

Bizarro voice? Mind-numbing repetition? All hopped-up and too fast to
dance to? Perfectly engineered to drive grown-ups mad? Check, check,
check and check — or better yet, gec, gec, gec and gec.

Destiny’s Child’s [“Say My
Name”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQgd6MccwZc) — in which a phone
call leads to suspicions of infidelity — may not have played out the
same way in the age of the text message. But in “Playing Games,” Summer
Walker elegantly sketches out an updated version of the same feeling.
“Swear that you doing the most, but we take a picture, can’t post it,”
she sings to someone. With its slow guitar lick and slurry production,
it’s a late-night outpouring of bottled-up grievances.

There’s a remix in which Bryson Tiller voices the other side of the
conversation, but something about the solo version feels more in line
with what Walker is trying to capture: a fed-up monologue that may well
go unanswered.

Walker knows something about the smoke-and-mirrors game of
self-expression in the digital era. Last November, she canceled 20
concert dates because, as she put it, touring “doesn’t really coexist
with my social anxiety and introverted personality.” On social media,
she can seem confessional and spontaneous, leading some to accuse her of
faking her anxiety. Both her music and her persona remind us, finally,
just how much digital communication allows us to control narratives, for
better and for worse. The person on the other end may never know why you
didn’t post a picture or return a text — or how many selfies were
deleted before getting one that told just the right story.

In 2015, country music was rocked by a controversy ridiculous enough to
earn the name “tomato-gate.” Explaining why mainstream country stations
played only a handful of female artists, the radio consultant Keith Hill
reached for a metaphor: “I play great female records, and we’ve got some
right now. They’re just not the lettuce in our salad.” The lettuce
included top-selling male artists like Blake Shelton and Keith Urban;
the women, Hill went on to explain, were the tomatoes.

From Kacey Musgraves to Kelsea Ballerini, Miranda Lambert to Maren
Morris, we are living in a golden age of women in country — but most of
them are succeeding despite the attitudes of men like Hill. On
“Redesigning Women,” the debut single from the Highwomen, you hear
four women’s voices — Morris, Amanda Shires, Brandi Carlile and Natalie
Hemby. Shires has said the idea of assembling an all-female supergroup
came to her when her daughter told her she wanted to be a musician: “I
thought the worst thing that could happen would be that she would go for
country, because there are only currently two women’s voices that you
can actually hear.”

As “Redesigning Women” reminds us, plenty of women toil half their lives
in the kitchen — which means they can throw together a dish with a lot
more depth than a sad, wilting bowl of lettuce and a couple of tomatoes.

At the beginning of 2020, I wanted to close my eyes and move. I did not
feel well for a number of reasons. I worried that the country was maybe
going to start a new war, and maybe going to re-elect its president; I
struggled with a moral and professional dilemma; and my mother was
suddenly, seriously ill. I was back home in suburban Los Angeles — in
her home, holed up in my old bedroom — when I wasn’t shuttling back and
forth to the hospital. I was in a funk to end all funks. What I needed
was to move, to sweat, to swing into a dark place filled with other
people and let out a wail. But there was no time to sneak off to a club
or a bar. So instead, I listened to an electronic-disco album called
“Bubba,” by Kay­tranada, many, many times.

Kay­tranada, born Louis Kevin Celestin, is a 27-year-old
Haitian-Canadian producer from Montreal. He made his first album,
“99.9%” (2016), in his mother’s house while sharing a basement
bedroom with his younger brother. He came out as gay shortly before the
album’s release. Sometimes I imagine Kay­tranada in his early 20s,
having never yet been with a man ([as he told The Fader
in 2016](https://www.thefader.com/2016/04/05/kaytranada-album-interview-99-percent)),
sharing a bedroom in his family home. Perhaps he also felt a need to
swing into a dark place filled with people and let out a wail. Perhaps
this is how disco found him. It is a genre sometimes derided for prizing
feeling over thinking, for using thumping bass and simple repetition to
get people onto a dance floor. But that discounts the healing that can
happen when people feel the urge to move.

“Bubba,” Kay­tranada’s second album, is 51 minutes and 17 tracks long,
but it feels like a single D.J. set, with smooth transitions from groove
to upbeat groove. Toward the middle, you reach the song “10%,” whose
hook has the Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis asking a question:
“You keep on takin’ from me, but where’s my 10 percent?” Kay­tranada
layers Uchis’s voice so that there is a slight echo to her inquiry; it
sounds as if she’s right next to the listener’s ear, cool but insistent,
whispering while dancing. “10%” is a song about exploitation, presumably
by some manager or business handler (“Run my money to me/Don’t act like
you didn’t know”), but it is also a song about being weary of pretense.
“You’re trying way too hard/Ego is not your friend,” Uchis sings,
though she isn’t going to stop to deal with the offender; she’s got
time.

The composition of the song itself seems to eschew showy effort, which
is not the same as being uncomplicated. “10%” is a song whose disparate
parts — steady conga drums, synthesized harps, jaunty violins — are all
in service to a single purpose: movement. Most of Kay­tranada’s dance
songs have this propulsive quality, owing in large part to his unique
use of funk-inflected drum sequences; they drive the rhythm forward as
opposed to holding it in a steady, stultifying loop.

“10%” is a song you can dance to with your eyes closed. The lyrics
provide texture, but it’s the rhythm itself that advises you on what to
do, and you can do it as awkwardly or as expertly as you’re physically
capable. Twirl, two-step or kind of roller-skate in place, sure. In this
way, the song is selling what Soul­Cycle is ostensibly selling, what the
forever-upbeat fitness coach on my workout app is selling. Looking good
helps, maybe, but the real item for sale is feeling good. And whether or
not you can find that dark dance floor full of strangers, “10%” is also
selling the feeling of not being alone. All music has elements of
emotional aspiration (we sing a love ballad and feel our own hearts
swell), but dance music offers a particular, seductive aspiration — the
possibility of being in physical and emotional communion with others, if
only for three minutes.

I have yet to find a suitable club or bar. But I have listened to this
song in the dark and imagined myself there, in the midst of a sweaty,
rapturous crowd, with the only people looking at me being those within
arm’s reach — and even then, only for a glimpse, before the music
carries them elsewhere.

It is vital for artists to have an understanding of what they are good
at, so that they might revel in the satisfaction of departure when the
time comes. Through their 25 years and 10 albums, Sleater-Kinney have
proved adept at a wide array of moves: volume and tone modulation,

Sleater-Kinney title track, especially if that title track opens the

[“The Center Won’t
Hold,”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/14/arts/music/sleater-kinney-the-center-wont-hold-review.html)like
many of its kin in the Sleater-Kinney title-track canon, takes its
position at the top of the band’s 2019 album (their second since their
2015 return from hiatus). The song pulls a magic trick: It’s a song
inside a song. In the first part, which lasts about 2 minutes 8 seconds,
voices chant, “The center won’t hold” over and over again in a heavy
sigh, on every third beat, with Carrie Brownstein wringing the emotion
out of the verse. The mood is both ominous and cocoonlike, akin to
watching tree branches lash a window during a storm while someone
familiar holds you. It is also the sound of Sleater-Kinney turning away
from whatever expectations a listener might have held.

When you listen to the song on repeat, the final 56 seconds feel
inevitable, but I would give anything to return to the moment when I
first heard it kick out of one gear and into the next. It feels like the
steep drop of a roller coaster after a meandering journey to the top.
The guitars grow louder, faster. The unmistakable drums of Janet Weiss
are unchained. The line “The center won’t hold” gets a new ferocity. As
gifted as Sleater-Kinney have shown themselves to be as lyricists, a
secondary excitement comes when those lyrics are honed to a fine point.
A repeated line or two act as the glue for the instruments’ tearing a
room apart. Here, Corin Tucker loops the words with increasing volume,
an attempt to keep up with the growing growl and thrash of sound at her
back. “The Center Won’t Hold” is the perfect encapsulation of
Sleater-Kinney at their best, eager and attacking.

The song’s lyrics and the album’s title bring to mind the W.B. Yeats
poem “The Second Coming” — “Things fall apart; the centre cannot
hold;/Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world” — it’s hard not to think of
them as a parable. The band didn’t emerge from this album as the same
band that went into the making of it. Janet Weiss, one of the great rock
drummers of all time, played on the album but [departed the band before
the album came
out.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/31/arts/music/sleater-kinney-st-vincent.html)
For those who have known Sleater-Kinney and loved them for a long time,
it might feel as if the band is in peak form for one last time.

Hearing the album all the way through, you can understand why Weiss
didn’t feel as if her role in the band made as much sense as it used
to. The back half of the title track, with all its sonic ferocity, is an
exception to the otherwise-glossy quality of the songs. The album still
teems with Sleater-Kinney’s characteristic wit and rage, but it’s
packaged in a lighter and more dreamlike set of sounds. There isn’t as
much room for Weiss’s signature drumming.

“The Center Won’t Hold” found a band trying newness, shifting from one
template to the next throughout the album but not sounding fully
comfortable in any of them. It would be easy for a longtime fan to feel
disappointment. But I eventually set aside nostalgia to allow myself
gratitude and admiration — not entirely for the music itself but for the
aims of the band in this new era. Consistent greatness, paired with
tenure, can be a recipe for complacency. Someone, somewhere, will always
be eager for a Sleater-Kinney album, even if it is the exact same album
as the one before it. But Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein have always
been curious about the places they could push their sound, and on this
album, they seem to be committing to a new set of curiosities — for the
sake of survival, but also for the sake of refusing stagnation. I’m
thankful for a band willing to turn corners, even as I’m heartbroken
about a member of that band’s being left behind.

When praising evolution and risk and becoming something beyond what
people expect of you, it must also be said that the act is often one of
undoing. The last 56 seconds of “The Center Won’t Hold” feel like the
site of an old fight that was neither won nor lost, brilliant anarchy
for anarchy’s sake. A band, pushing themselves and their sound to its
limit, before turning out the lights on an era and running toward a new
one.
