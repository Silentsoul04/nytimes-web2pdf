From the start of the coronavirus outbreak, statements from the
presidential pulpit have been far out of step with those of health
experts and many inside the administration. President Trump contradicted
some officials while they were standing right next to him. Here is a
sampling of what Mr. Trump has said compared with statements made by
prominent officials.

\textbf{President Trump's statements}

\textbf{What experts said}

\hypertarget{jan-22}{%
\subsubsection{Jan. 22}\label{jan-22}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

In late January, \textbf{President Trump} expressed optimism. ``We have
it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we
have it under control. It's going to be just fine,'' he said
\href{https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/cnbc-transcript-president-donald-trump-sits-down-with-cnbcs-joe-kernen-at-the-world-economic-forum-in-davos-switzerland.html}{on
CNBC}.

Just a week later, the director-general of the World Health
Organization, \textbf{Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus}, declared a
\href{https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-statement-on-ihr-emergency-committee-on-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)}{public
health emergency}: ``The main reason for this declaration is not because
of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other
countries.''

\hypertarget{feb-2}{%
\subsubsection{Feb. 2}\label{feb-2}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

With fewer than a dozen cases reported, \textbf{Mr. Trump} said in an
appearance with \textbf{Sean Hannity} that the United States had stopped
the virus's spread by restricting travel. ``We pretty much shut it down
coming in from China,'' he said.

\hypertarget{feb-7}{%
\subsubsection{Feb. 7}\label{feb-7}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/azar.jpg}

\textbf{Alex M. Azar II}, the health and human services secretary,
however,
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdt2krYW4Fk\&feature=youtu.be\&t=2572}{said}
the travel restrictions ``were very measured and incremental.'' They did
not apply to American citizens, permanent residents or their immediate
family.

\hypertarget{feb-12}{%
\subsubsection{Feb. 12}\label{feb-12}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/george.jpg}

And the executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense,
\textbf{Asha M. George}, said travel restrictions came too late.
``Travel restrictions are not going to remain the sole way to try and
control all of this.''

\hypertarget{feb-13}{%
\subsubsection{Feb. 13}\label{feb-13}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/redfield.jpg}

By mid-February, few U.S. cases had been confirmed but public health
officials were predicting a lengthy outbreak. ``This virus is probably
with us beyond this season, beyond this year,'' \textbf{Dr. Robert
Redfield}, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/health/coronavirus-cdc-robert-redfield-gupta-intv/index.html}{on
CNN}.

\hypertarget{feb-14}{%
\subsubsection{Feb. 14}\label{feb-14}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

But \textbf{Mr. Trump} told the National Border Patrol Council not to
worry. ``There's a theory that, in April, when it gets warm ---
historically, that has been able to kill the virus.'' (W.H.O. later
said, ``We have no reason to believe that this virus would behave
differently in different temperatures.'')

\hypertarget{feb-26}{%
\subsubsection{Feb. 26}\label{feb-26}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

Even as the number of cases rose to 60, \textbf{Mr. Trump} said
\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference/}{at
a news conference} that infections were declining. ``We're going down,
not up. We're going very substantially down, not up.'' He continued,
``As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we're going to
be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two
people over the next short period of time.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/azar.jpg}

\textbf{Mr. Azar}, at the same news conference as Mr. Trump, said
clearly, ``We can expect to see more cases in the United States.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/schuchat.jpg}

And \textbf{Dr. Anne Schuchat}, the principal deputy director of the
C.D.C., said the same. ``We do expect more cases, and this is a good
time to prepare.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/messonnier.jpg}

That same day, \textbf{Dr. Nancy Messonnier,} the director of the
C.D.C's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases,
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0225-cdc-telebriefing-covid-19.html}{said
the virus would continue to spread}. ``It's not so much a question of if
this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this
will happen and how many people in this country will have severe
illness,'' she said.

\hypertarget{feb-27}{%
\subsubsection{Feb. 27}\label{feb-27}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

At the White House the next day, \textbf{Mr. Trump}
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aas3YQKIFeY}{offered a mixed
message} on the outbreak's trajectory. ``It's going to disappear. One
day --- it's like a miracle --- it will disappear. And from our shores,
we --- you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could
maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows.''

\hypertarget{feb-28}{%
\subsubsection{Feb. 28}\label{feb-28}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

At
\href{https://www.c-span.org/video/?469663-1/president-trump-campaign-event-north-charleston-south-carolina\&start=395}{a
rally in South Carolina}, \textbf{Mr. Trump} said that Democrats had
been ``politicizing'' his response to the coronavirus, just as he said
they had the Russia investigation and the impeachment inquiry. ``They
tried anything, they tried it over and over,'' he said. ``And this is
their new hoax.'' Later, he accused the news media of being in
``hysteria mode'' over the coronavirus, which he suggested was
unwarranted.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

When U.S. cases surpassed 100, \textbf{Mr. Trump} assured attendees
\href{https://www.c-span.org/video/?469845-1/president-trump-campaigns-charlotte-north-carolina\&live\&start=685}{at
a rally in Charlotte, N.C.}, that a vaccine was on the way. ``We had a
great meeting today with a lot of the great companies, and they're going
to have vaccines, I think, relatively soon,'' he said.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/fauci.jpg}

But earlier that day, \textbf{Dr. Anthony S. Fauci}, the director of
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said
\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-members-coronavirus-task-force-meeting-pharmaceutical-companies/}{a
vaccine would take time}. ``You won't have a vaccine,'' he said, noting
that a vaccine would need to be tested first. It would take, he said,
``a year to a year and a half.''

\hypertarget{march-3}{%
\subsubsection{March 3}\label{march-3}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/ghebreyesus.jpg}

Public health experts expressed concerns about
\href{https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020}{the
deadliness of the virus}. The W.H.O.'s \textbf{Dr. Ghebreyesus} said of
the fatality rate, ``Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported COVID-19
cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer
than 1 percent of those infected.''

\hypertarget{march-4}{%
\subsubsection{March 4}\label{march-4}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

\textbf{Mr. Trump} told \textbf{Mr. Hannity} that
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqjrlKfW93I}{he had a hunch} the
fatality rate was lower. ``Well, I think the 3.4 percent is really a
false number. Now, and this is just my hunch, and, but based on a lot of
conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot people
will have this and it's very mild.'' He continued, ``I think the number,
personally, I would say the number is way under 1 percent.''

\hypertarget{march-5}{%
\subsubsection{March 5}\label{march-5}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/pence.jpg}

Hundreds of new cases began to be announced daily even as \textbf{Vice
President Mike Pence} offered a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/06/us/politics/pence-trump-coronavirus.html}{blunt
assessment} of testing capacity. ``We don't have enough tests today to
meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward,'' he said.

\hypertarget{march-6}{%
\subsubsection{March 6}\label{march-6}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

But the next day, \textbf{Mr. Trump} insisted, ``Anybody that needs a
test can have a test.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/azar.jpg}

\textbf{Mr. Azar} was forced to clarify: ``You may not get a test unless
a doctor or public health official prescribes a test.''

\hypertarget{march-7}{%
\subsubsection{March 7}\label{march-7}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

With nearly every state reporting at least one case, a reporter asked
Mr. Trump whether he was concerned that the virus was getting closer to
the White House. \textbf{Mr. Trump} replied, ``No, I'm not concerned at
all. No, I'm not. No, we've done a great job.''

\hypertarget{march-10}{%

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

\textbf{Mr. Trump} suggested that his signature policy proposal, a
border wall with Mexico, required renewed urgency in the face of the
outbreak. ``Going up fast. We need the Wall more than ever!''
\href{https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1237334397172490240?lang=en}{he
tweeted}.

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/redfield.jpg}

At a
\href{https://www.c-span.org/video/?470181-1/cdc-director-redfield-testifies-coronavirus\&live\&vod\&start=5721}{congressional
hearing} that day, \textbf{Dr. Redfield} was asked whether structural
barriers at U.S. borders would mitigate the outbreak. ``Not that I've
seen,'' he replied.

\hypertarget{march-11}{%
\subsubsection{March 11}\label{march-11}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/ghebreyesus.jpg}

The W.H.O. declared that the coronavirus had become a
\href{https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020}{pandemic}.
``W.H.O. has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are
deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and
by the alarming levels of inaction,'' \textbf{Dr. Ghebreyesus} said.

\hypertarget{march-12}{%
\subsubsection{March 12}\label{march-12}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/fauci.jpg}

Testing availability remained a concern for \textbf{Dr. Fauci}, who
\href{https://www.c-span.org/video/?470277-1/federal-health-officials-testify-coronavirus-outbreak-response\&start=680}{told
Congress}, ``The system is not really geared to what we need right now,
what you are asking for. That is a failing. It is a failing. Let's admit
it.''

\hypertarget{march-13}{%
\subsubsection{March 13}\label{march-13}}

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

\textbf{Mr. Trump} suggested at a news conference that \textbf{Google}
would handle some of the burden of making tests available. ``I want to
thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It's going to be
very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a
test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient
location.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/pichai.jpg}

\textbf{Google} pointed to
\href{https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1238574670686928906}{a
statement} from \textbf{Verily}, with which it shares a parent company,
saying a tool to triage coronavirus cases was in the early stages of
development. Google C.E.O. \textbf{Sundar Pichai} later said
\href{https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/covid-19-how-were-continuing-to-help/}{its
own plans} were limited to creating an informational website ``dedicated
to COVID-19 education, prevention and local resources nationwide.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/trump.jpg}

On Sunday, as the U.S. passed 3,000 cases, \textbf{Mr. Trump} said
\href{https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-2/}{the
situation was under control}. ``This is a very contagious virus. It's
incredible. But it's something we have tremendous control of.''

\includegraphics{https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/newsgraphics/2020/03/17/trump-covid-statements/7572af7fab273933d0c3bc2441baa406ebf19faf/fauci.jpg}

\textbf{Dr. Fauci}, at the same news conference, offered the opposite
assessment. ``The worst is, yes, ahead for us. It is how we respond to
that challenge that's going to determine what the ultimate endpoint is
going to be.''

\hypertarget{march-17}{%

By Tuesday, \textbf{Mr. Trump's} message had shifted completely from
January. ``I've always known this is a real --- this is a pandemic,'' he
said. ``I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.''
