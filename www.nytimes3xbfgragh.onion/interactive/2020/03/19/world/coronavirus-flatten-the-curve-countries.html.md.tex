Just a few weeks ago, \textbf{China} was overwhelmed by the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{coronavirus
pandemic} that began in Wuhan. Since then, it has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/18/world/asia/coronavirus-china-aid.html}{drastically
reduced} the number of new cases, what is known as flattening the curve.

\textbf{South Korea} appears to be headed on a similar path.

These charts track the number of new confirmed cases each day. Each red
line is the seven-day moving average, which smooths out day-to-day
anomalies in how the data are reported by authorities. The number of
cases in China had a big jump in mid-February because
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/13/world/asia/coronavirus-numbers-explain.html}{officials
changed} the way cases were counted.

Despite their close proximity to China, \textbf{Singapore, Hong Kong and
Taiwan} have managed to keep the number of cases down with
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore-hong-kong-taiwan.html}{some
success}, through vigilant monitoring and early intervention.

But recent spikes in those places suggest that they are still at risk.
For example, 21 of the 23 new cases in Taiwan and at least 13 of the new
cases in Hong Kong on Wednesday were people who had recently traveled
overseas.

More countries are now
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html}{implementing
travel bans} or mandatory quarantine for returning travelers, as the
pandemic continues to ravage the world,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html}{sickening
more than 210,000} people as of Wednesday evening.

In the United States and five other countries, the number of known
coronavirus cases is still growing rapidly. They have all reported
\textbf{more than 4,000 new cases in the past week}.

These six countries have had less severe outbreaks so far but still
reported \textbf{more than 1,000 new cases each in the past week}.

\hypertarget{where-countries-are-on-the-curve}{%
\subsection{Where Countries Are on the
Curve}\label{where-countries-are-on-the-curve}}

Here's a look at the trajectories of coronavirus cases in all of the
countries that have had \textbf{more than 50 confirmed cases so far} and
that have recorded new cases for \textbf{more than 12 days}. Scales are
adjusted in each country to make the curve more readable. The countries
are sorted by the number of new cases in the past week.

Note: Data is through March 18.

\textbf{Correction:}~April 8, 2020

An earlier version of this article gave an incomplete description of
charts shown in a section of the page. The section ``Where Countries Are
on the Curve'' includes countries with more than 50 confirmed cases that
had also recorded new cases for more than 12 days, not just countries
with more than 50 confirmed cases.
