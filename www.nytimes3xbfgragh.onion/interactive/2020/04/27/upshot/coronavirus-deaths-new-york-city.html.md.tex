New Yorkers} have died since March 11 --- 20,900 more than would be
expected over this period and thousands more than have been captured by
official coronavirus death statistics.

As of Sunday, the city had
\href{https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-deaths-confirmed-probable-daily-04262020.pdf}{attributed
16,673 deaths to coronavirus}, either because people had tested positive
for the virus, or because the circumstances of their death meant that
city health officials believed the virus to be the most likely cause of
death.

But there remains a large gap between the 16,673 figure and the total
deaths above typical levels in the last six and a half weeks: more than
4,200 people whose deaths are not captured by the official coronavirus
toll.

A review of mortality data in 12 countries showed that
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{official
death tallies have undercounted coronavirus deaths} by tens of
thousands.

The recent death count reached six times the normal number of deaths for
the city at this time of year, a surge in deaths much larger than what
could be attributed to normal seasonal variations from influenza, heart
disease or other more common causes. The city's largest mass casualty
event in recent memory, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, claimed
only a small fraction as many lives.

It is too soon to know the precise causes of death for New Yorkers in
this period. Although many of the deaths not currently attributed to
coronavirus may represent an undercount of the outbreak's direct toll,
the broader effects of the pandemic might have also increased deaths
indirectly. Throughout the city, emergency rooms have been overcrowded,
ambulance response has been slowed, and many residents might have been
reluctant to seek medical care because of fears of contracting the
virus. Hospitals around the country have reported reductions in
admission for heart attacks, one sign that some people may be dying at
home from ailments they would survive during more normal times.

The measurements in our chart rely on a New York Times analysis of
mortality data from the city's Department of Health and from the
National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. They capture the number of New York City residents who
have died each week since January 2017. The total number of deaths for
the period from the start of the outbreak through April 25 comes from
the city health department. The way in which these deaths are
distributed by week is an approximation based on how mortality data has
lagged in the past.

Even with these high totals, the recent numbers in our charts are most
likely an undercount of all deaths in the city. In normal times, death
certificates take time to be processed and collected, and complete death
tallies can take weeks to become final. But even if the current count is
perfect, roughly 27,600 New Yorkers have died of all causes since the
beginning of the epidemic. That's about 20,900 more than is typical.

Note: Weekly allocation of deaths since March 11, 2020, is an
approximation based on how mortality data has lagged in the past. Recent
data is provisional and may increase as more deaths are counted.\\
