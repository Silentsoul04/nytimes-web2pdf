New Fiction

The couple had arranged to meet Chrissy near the Battle Monument. She
had met them once, five years ago, when she served as the buyers' lawyer
at the closing of their house. Soon after, the wife contacted her about
estate planning. Chrissy sent them material and never heard back. She
had forgotten them until the wife emailed again, apologizing for having
disappeared. ``We've set our hearts to follow through this time,'' she
wrote.

They were not the first procrastinating clients. People told Chrissy
about the distress of appointing guardians for their infant children, of
making decisions for their future selves. She herself had neither a will
nor plans in place --- nothing wrong with that. A doctor could smoke;
or, like her father, drink himself to oblivion. No one says you have to
live up to the standard defined by your profession.

\textbf{The magnolia trees} lining the avenue were at their peak.
Chrissy picked up a palm-size petal on a bench. Magnolias are such
confident flowers. The petals, even fallen, feel alive.

Years ago Chrissy and her two best friends dug a hole and buried an
envelope under one of those magnolia trees. Inside they had written
notes, to be read again when they turned 50. To mark the solemnity of
the event, they each put a single earring in it. Chrissy's was an opal
unicorn.

None of them remembered the envelope when they turned 50. The memory
only came back to Chrissy now.

``Jeannie?'' a man a few steps away said tentatively.

Chrissy said she was not Jeannie, and he apologized. Was he meeting
Jeannie for a date? They would have to take their masks off, she
thought, to make a good impression. And how could they trust each other
if they took off their masks?

\textbf{The couple had no trouble} recognizing Chrissy, nor she them.
They were the only three people near the sculpture of General
Washington. The couple apologized that their two friends, the witnesses,
were running late.

Chrissy preferred punctuality. She disliked small talk. Still, she asked
the couple about their life under lockdown. The husband nodded
courteously and strolled away. He probably hated small talk, too.

``And the children? Which grades are they in now?'' Chrissy said.

The wife glanced at the husband. He was farther away, studying General
Washington. ``Ethan is in sixth grade.'' There was a pause before that
answer came.

Did they have one child? Chrissy remembered two, from the small talk
five years ago. But it was true that only Ethan's name was in the wills.
Perhaps she had mixed them up with another family.

``You must be thinking of ... Zoe?'' the wife said in a lowered voice.

``Right ... ,'' Chrissy said. She knew then what the wife would say, and
was relieved that the witnesses arrived just then. Zoe was dead. Chrissy
wished she had not asked about the children. Such an innocent question,
but there was never a truly innocent question.

\textbf{The signing took no more} than 10 minutes. The couple were
healthy. Neither had been married before, or had children outside this
marriage. No complications, that was how Chrissy thought of clients like
them. Yet they all came with some complications. Often Chrissy preferred
not to dwell upon them.

As the couple and the witnesses walked away, Chrissy called out to the
wife: ``Mrs. Carson.''

The husband and the witnesses walked on, in a triangular formation with
the right distance in between. Chrissy wanted to say something about
Zoe. The wife had mentioned the name for a reason.

The wife gestured to the papers in Chrissy's folder. ``Strangely
uplifting, isn't it? Signing our wills on a sunny day like this.''

``It's a good thing to do,'' Chrissy said, an automatic response.

``Yes,'' the wife said, and thanked Chrissy again.

They would part then, and they might not see each other again. Chrissy
would forget this meeting, as she had forgotten what she wrote to
herself as a teenager. But someday she would remember this moment, and
she wished that she had said more than a platitude, as she wished she
had remembered the note to herself, or she had said something to her
father about his drinking.

``I'm so sorry,'' Chrissy said, ``about Zoe.'' The most banal words, but
there are never the right words. That's an excuse for saying nothing.

The wife nodded. ``Sometimes I wish Zoe had been less resolute,'' she
said. ``I wish she had been like me or her father. We're both
procrastinators.''

And yet no teacher or parent would encourage a child's procrastination
or indecision, Chrissy thought. Why did she and her friends believe that
decades later, they would still remember the notes, and they would still
be interested in them? The confidence in life's consistency, for a young
person, easily turns into the despair at life's unchangeableness.

``But you've followed through this time,'' Chrissy said, pointing to the
folder. A platitude again, but platitudes, like procrastination, have
their meaning, too.
