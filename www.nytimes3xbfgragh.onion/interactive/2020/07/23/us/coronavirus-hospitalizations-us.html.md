### Covid-19 patients per 100,000

<div data-role="img">

At overflowing hospitals in South Texas, patients wait hours in
sweltering ambulances and on recliner beds set up in hallways. The
number of patients intubated in hospital beds in Tampa, Fla., is growing
by the day. In Corpus Christi, Texas, a mobile morgue has arrived.

About as many people are now [known to be
hospitalized](https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-currently-hospitalized)
with the coronavirus in the United States as during any other time in
the pandemic, matching the previous peak in April.

Public health experts say detailed local data on where people are
hospitalized — a real-time measure that does not depend on levels of
testing — is crucial to understanding the epidemic, but federal
officials have not made this data public. The New York Times gathered
data for nearly 50 metropolitan areas, including 15 of the 20 largest
cities in the country, from state and local health departments to
provide the first detailed national look at where people are falling
seriously ill.

The data, as well as interviews across the country, show a far-reaching
crisis. The worst-hit areas in Texas and Florida have approached the
peak rates of hospitalization that New York, New Orleans, Chicago and
other cities hit in the spring. A wide and growing expanse of hot spots
around the country — including Las Vegas, Nashville and Tulsa, Okla. —
have worsened over the past two weeks.

Not every hospital system is overwhelmed, and new treatments have
improved the chances of survival for seriously ill people. But experts
say a small but significant proportion of those currently hospitalized
will die, and those who survive may face serious long-term health
issues.

Months ago, the endless wail of ambulances in New York City conveyed the
urgency of the virus outbreak in a concentrated area. Now, the scale of
the crisis is dispersed and harder to grasp.

“There’s this pandemic fatigue,” said Thomas Tsai, an assistant
professor of health policy at Harvard University. “All eyes were on New
York. Houston is New York now. Miami is New York now. Phoenix is New
York now. We need that shared collective urgency.”

<div id="g-nycpeak-blurb" class="g-container">

No place comes close to matching New York City’s sheer numbers: At its
hospitalization peak in mid-April, more than 12,000 New Yorkers were
hospitalized at one time.

</div>

<div id="g-neworleanspeak-blurb" class="g-container">

Some places today look more like New Orleans, an early epicenter that at
one point had about 1,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients.

</div>

<div id="g-riogrande-blurb" class="g-container">

This region on the southern border of Texas most likely has the worst
rate of hospitalization in the country. [Hospitals are
full](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/19/us/coronavirus-texas-rio-grande-valley.html).
Moving from bed to bed, medical workers wrapped in protective layers
yell over blaring alarms. Nurses softly soothe dying patients. There is
little time to grieve. A new patient fills an emptied bed.

</div>

<div id="g-corpuschristi-blurb" class="g-container">

At least 87 people have died from the coronavirus in the past three
weeks; as recently as the end of June, only eight people had. “The movie
that you never wanted to be living in — that’s what it’s like,” said
Annette Rodriguez, the county’s public health director.

</div>

<div id="g-miami-blurb" class="g-container">

“Your hospitals are drowning,” Carlos Migoya, the chief executive of
Jackson Health System, the largest public hospital in Miami, [wrote in
an op-ed in The Miami
Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article244194817.html).
“We are teetering on the edge of disaster.”

<div id="g-victoria-blurb" class="g-container">

Of the top 10 places we found with the most severe coronavirus
hospitalization rates, six were in Texas.

<div id="g-imperial-blurb" class="g-container">

Imperial County, home to many food-processing workers and farmworkers on
the California-Mexico border, became the first county in California to
revert to a stay-at-home order this month as cases soared with positive
test rates four times the state average.

<div id="g-chicagopeak-blurb" class="g-container">

The number of coronavirus patients in Chicago is now less than a third
of what it was at its peak.

Several areas in Florida, including the Fort Lauderdale region, are
under nightly curfews to slow the spread of the virus.

</div>

<div id="g-houston-blurb" class="g-container">

The number of newly hospitalized patients in the Houston area is down
slightly in recent days, but the county is still home to the most
coronavirus patients in Texas. More than 2,200 people with the virus are
in hospitals.

</div>

<div id="g-tampa-blurb" class="g-container">

The number of patients who need to be intubated at Tampa General
Hospital keeps growing. “We've gone from single digits to double digits,
basically every day,” said Dr. Andrew Myers, an internist at the
hospital.

<div id="g-sanantonio-blurb" class="g-container">

“Things are worse than they’ve ever been,” said Nelson Wolff, the county
judge for San Antonio’s Bexar County, which had more Covid-19 patients

<div id="g-arizona-blurb" class="g-container">

Arizona is one of several states with hot spots that did not provide
local data, making it difficult to know the precise hospital situation
in Phoenix, a center of the crisis. Statewide, Covid-19 hospitalizations
have leveled off in recent days, offering hope that measures like mask
mandates and the closure of gyms, bars and nightclubs are working.

</div>

<div id="g-orlando-blurb" class="g-container">

Inside hospitals in Orlando’s Orange County this week, the number of
Covid-19 patients was the highest it has been during the pandemic.
Outside, Disney World had reopened, and SeaWorld was splashing again. It
is one of the jarring contrasts in a crisis that is now spread widely
and sometimes hard to see.

“We are hoping we don’t see a huge spike again,” said Gregory Burrell,
the funeral director at Terry Funeral Home, Inc., a funeral home in

Major cities within each county or area are shown. Hospitalization and
intensive care figures are census counts of the number of Covid-19
patients at any one time, not hospital admissions or cumulative
hospitalizations. They include patients that have confirmed Covid-19
illness based on lab tests as well as probable or suspected patients who
exhibited certain symptoms. Not all states provide information on
probable patients. Hospitalization figures are from July 21, or the most
recent day that data was available.
