A win by Marjorie Taylor Greene would be a headache for G.O.P. leaders
since she supports QAnon, a fringe group pushing a pro-Trump conspiracy
theory. Her opponent, John Cowan, is no less conservative, but does not
believe in a ``deep state'' of child-molesting Satanist traitors.

Democratic-leaning district. Derrick Van Orden, a former Navy Seal, is
well-funded, has former Gov. Scott Walker's endorsement and recently got
publicity for saving a woman from choking in a local restaurant.
