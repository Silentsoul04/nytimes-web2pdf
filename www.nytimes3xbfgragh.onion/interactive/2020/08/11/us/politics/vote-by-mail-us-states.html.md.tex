Note: Montana authorized its counties to mail ballots to all voters but
in counties that opt not to, voters will still need to apply for an
absentee ballot.

At least three-quarters of all American voters will be eligible to
receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election --- the most in U.S.
history, according to a New York Times analysis. If recent election
trends hold and turnout increases, as experts predict, roughly 80
million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall, more than
double the number that were returned in 2016.

The rapid and seismic shift in how Americans will vote is because of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html}{coronavirus
pandemic}. Concerns about the potential for virus transmission at
polling places have forced many states to make adjustments on the fly
that --- despite President Trump's protests --- will make mail voting in
America more accessible this fall than ever before.

``I have a hard time looking back at history and finding an election
where there was this significant of a change to how elections are
administered in this short a time period,'' said Alex Padilla, the
California secretary of state who chairs the Democratic Association of
Secretaries of State.

Most of the changes are temporary and have been made administratively by
state and local officials who have the power to make adjustments during
emergencies like the pandemic.

All states allow at least some mail voting, but some will make it more
accessible to voters than others.

In nine states and Washington, D.C., every registered voter will be
mailed a ballot ahead of the election. California, D.C. and Vermont will
do this for the first time this fall.

In 34 states, voters can cite the coronavirus as a reason to vote
absentee or they can cast absentee ballots without specifying a reason.

In nine states, every registered voter will automatically be mailed an
application to request an absentee ballot.

In 25 states, voters will need to procure an application for an absentee
ballot themselves.

In seven states, voters still need a reason beyond the virus to vote
absentee. That means many voters in these states will need to vote in
person at a polling place, barring any last-minute rule changes.

Several of the states that made changes for the primaries are keeping
them in place for the general election, while others are making separate
adjustments for the fall. A handful of states have not made any
modifications and appear unlikely to do so.

Over all, 27 states and Washington, D.C., have in some way expanded
voter access to mail ballots for the 2020 general election, with the
broad goal of making it easier for people to vote amid a global health
crisis. And in some states that maintained relatively strict rules,
individual counties have undertaken similar efforts.

Note: Connecticut, Delaware, and Massachusetts have authorized absentee
voting for all voters and will also mail absentee ballot applications.

Several new pieces of state legislation are
\href{https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/state-action-on-covid-19-and-elections.aspx}{also
still pending}, and experts say more changes could be forthcoming
through executive action, litigation or other mechanisms in a few
states, including New York.

But they also note that many Americans who choose to vote by mail this
cycle because of the virus will simply be leveraging options that have
long been available to them under existing laws.

\subsection{More mail votes, higher

During the presidential primaries, many states that made it easier for
people to vote by mail saw higher turnout than states that made fewer
changes.

Of the states that have held presidential primaries and caucuses this
year, 31 saw an increase in turnout compared with 2016. Of those, 18 had
sent either ballots or ballot applications to all voters ahead of the
primaries.

Note: Seven states that have had primaries or caucuses are not shown in
the chart because vote-by-mail data is not available. Of those,
Minnesota and Wyoming had overall increases in turnout. Arkansas,
Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee had decreases in
turnout.

Six states continued to require voters to have a reason other than the
virus in order to vote absentee in the primaries. In those states, voter
turnout stayed roughly the same as 2016.

Michael P. McDonald, a University of Florida professor who studies
American elections, said that recent election trends, including many of
this year's primaries, have indicated that turnout will be up in the
fall compared with 2016, and that the widespread use of mail voting will
shatter previous records.

``It's sort of trite to say that you're going to have the highest
turnout rate of your lifetime or this is the most important election of
your lifetime, but it really feels like that,'' he said. ``I'm still
expecting this to have very high turnout in November. The outstanding
question that we have is just: Will the election system be able to bear
that?''

Indeed, the primaries also exposed the myriad problems that elections
officials and voters could face this fall.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/09/us/politics/wisconsin-election-absentee-coronavirus.html}{missing
or nullified mail ballots} stretched the system to the brink of
collapse. In
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/25/us/politics/georgia-election-voting-problems.html}{Georgia}'s
most populous county, voters encountered an election meltdown rife with
their own interminable lines and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/us/politics/georgia-voting-machines.html}{malfunctioning
technology}. And in New York, it took several weeks for overwhelmed
officials to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/19/us/politics/nyc-vote-by-mail.html}{count
thousands of mail ballots} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/nyregion/maloney-torres-ny-congressional-races.html}{deliver
results}.

All the while, Mr. Trump has fiercely criticized mail voting --- while
allowing that military members and older Americans should be allowed to
vote absentee --- saying that sending ballots to voters directly would
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html}{compromise
the election's integrity}. More broadly, some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/08/us/politics/republicans-vote-by-mail.html}{Republicans}
have continued to insist without evidence that voting by mail favors
Democrats.

Mail voting has expanded unevenly along somewhat partisan lines: Several
of the states identified by
\href{https://cookpolitical.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/EC\%20Ratings.072320.2.pdf?}{The
Cook Political Report} as solid or likely Democratic in the 2020 general
election have implemented some of the most expansive mail voting
programs; many of the states identified as solid or likely Republican
have continued to restrict access to mail voting.

Note: Maine and Nebraska select electors using the District method, in
which each congressional district in the state selects its own elector,
and the remaining two electoral college votes are determined by the
popular vote winner.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/12/18/us/voter-fraud.html}{Studies
have repeatedly shown} that voting fraud of any kind is extremely rare
in the United States. And states and counties that have transitioned to

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/10/us/politics/vote-by-mail.html}{seen

\hypertarget{potential-problems-in-november}{%
\subsection{Potential problems in
November}\label{potential-problems-in-november}}

Researchers said that thinly stretched election offices might quickly
become overwhelmed by the volume of mail ballots. To help lessen their
load, elections officials in several key swing states have already asked
that lawmakers
\href{https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/07/how-absentee-ballots-are-deepening-the-divide-between-michigan-democrats-and-republicans.html}{give
them more leeway} to prepare absentee ballots for counting as they
arrive rather than after the polls close.

Their problems could be compounded by a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/10/us/politics/postal-service-trump-coronavirus.html}{lack
of funding for the Postal Service}. If there are slowdowns in either
election offices or post offices, experts said, ballots may not get sent
out in a timely manner or returned by postmark deadlines.

Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the
University of California, Irvine, said he remained ``very worried'' that
scores of
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-congress-carolyn-maloney-ballots.html}{voters
would be disenfranchised} through no fault of their own. Because many
voters will be unfamiliar with the mail voting process, he and other
experts said, they were concerned that voters could make
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/17/nyregion/election-absentee-ballots-primary.html}{unintentional
technical errors} when marking, signing, sealing or sending a ballot,
leading to their ballots
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/nyregion/nyc-mail-ballots-voting.html}{eventually
being rejected}.

And those voting in person may have to confront
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/06/nyregion/the-path-to-becoming-an-underpaid-underappreciated-and-absolutely-necessary-election-poll-worker.html}{poll
worker shortages} that onlookers say are likely to be exacerbated by the
pandemic.

``It's going to be bumpy,'' said Amber McReynolds, the chief executive
of the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition. ``Will it be a
disaster in a particular state? That's hard to tell at this moment.''

Well-prepared states that are accustomed to counting a high number of
mail ballots --- and where the presidential race is not close --- could
get called on election night. But experts say that in other states, the
counting could delay race calls for at least a day or two. And in states
where the presidential contest is tight and laws are inflexible, a clear
picture of who has won could take weeks to develop.

Despite the challenges, Phil Keisling, who was Oregon's secretary of
state when it began mailing ballots to voters more than two decades ago,
was among more than a half-dozen experts who expressed faith that
election administrators would get their jobs done.

``Tens of millions of people are in election terra incognita, and so
there's anxiety, and it's understandable,'' Mr. Keisling said. ``But I
am guardedly optimistic that we will run an election that will meet very
high standards of professionalism, and that the vast majority of
Americans, even if they don't like the results, are going to believe
that the results are fair.''

\textbf{Correction:}~Aug. 11, 2020

The cartogram in an earlier version of this article incorrectly
indicated the number of registered voters in some states. The article
also gave the wrong number of voters for states that mail ballots
directly to all voters and those that allow absentee voting for all. In
addition, it miscategorized several states in regards to their absentee
voting rules. Montana is a state that allows absentee voting for all,
not one that mails ballots directly to all voters. Ohio and
Massachusetts are states that will mail absentee ballot applications to
all voters; voters will not have to procure an application themselves.
Virginia made a change to suspend its witness requirement to vote
absentee.
