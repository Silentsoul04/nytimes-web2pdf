A shadow of hunger looms over the United States. In the pandemic
economy, nearly one in eight households doesn’t have enough to eat. The
lockdown, with its epic lines at food banks, has revealed what was
hidden in plain sight: that the struggle to make food last long enough,
and to get food that’s healthful — what experts call ‘food insecurity’ —
is a persistent one for millions of
Americans.

Beginning in May, Brenda Ann Kenneally set out across the country, from
<span class="place">New York</span> to
<span class="place">California</span>, to capture the routines of
Americans who struggle to feed their families, piecing together various
forms of food assistance, community support and ingenuity to make it
from one month to the next.

Food insecurity is as much about the threat of deprivation as it is
about deprivation itself: A food-insecure life means a life lived in
fear of hunger, and the psychological toll that takes. **** Like many
hardships, this burden falls disproportionately on Black and Hispanic
families, who are almost twice as likely to experience food insecurity
as white families.

Like so many who live at hunger’s edge, the members of the extended
Stocklas family — whom Kenneally has photographed for years — gain and
lose food stamps depending on fluctuating employment status in an
unstable economy. They often have trouble stretching their funds to the
end of the month, so they pool resources to provide family-style dinners
for all.

Just days before Kenneally arrived, the governor closed schools
statewide, creating a new source of stress for food-insecure families,
which often rely on free school lunches to keep their school-age
children fed. This made the family’s big collective meals all the more
crucial. “Even if it’s just pitching in $10 when we don’t have food

June 6

Late last year, Doris Hall, 63, moved back to Gary, her hometown, to
look after her great-grandchildren — “so they don’t have to be in
daycare,” she says. On weekends, she takes in as many as nine of the
children — occasionally all 14 — so that their parents can work.

vary: spaghetti, chicken, soups, tacos. When she has a rare moment to
eat alone, she makes her favorite meal for herself: greens and tacos.

In Cicero, just west of Chicago, Jennifer Villa, 29, was living in an
apartment with a kitchen that needed plumbing repairs. She and her
family were already struggling — a disability makes it hard for her to
work — and the pandemic had meant less fresh food and even longer pantry
lines.

By June, the social upheavals following the killing of George Floyd
created even more instability for some families. Kenneally visited
Manausha Russ, 28, a few days after protests led to the closure of a
nearby Family Dollar, where Russ used to get basics like milk, cereal
and diapers. “The stores by my house were all looted,” she says.

In so many places, Kenneally found food-insecure families were helping
one another out despite their own hardship. Here, in a condominium
complex on the city’s east side, a neighbor picked up free school
lunches and distributed them to children in the building, including the
Boughton sisters: Brooklyn, 4, on the far right, Chynna, 9, and Katie,
8, seen here with a neighbor’s toddler who has since moved
away.

Most of the families Kenneally photographed had struggled to feed
themselves adequately for years. But she also met families who had been
thrown into food insecurity by the
pandemic.

In long conversations around the country this August — at kitchen
tables, in living rooms and sitting in cars in slow-moving food lines
with rambunctious children in the back — Americans reflected on their
new reality. The shame and embarrassment. The loss of choice in
something as basic as what to eat. The worry over how to make sure their
children get a healthy diet. The fear that their lives will never get
back on track.

By late June, Kenneally had reached

Covid-19 was falling hard on some of America’s most chronically
impoverished areas, where residents have lived under hunger’s shadow for
years. The pandemic dropped the state’s labor participation rate to just
53 percent, the lowest in the nation.

The city of Jackson (population 164,000) is often classified as a “food
desert” for its high rate of food insecurity and the scarcity of
well-stocked stores. Deidre Lyons lives there with her three kids,
sister, niece and father. Lyons, 28, receives $524 a month in food
stamps, but without access to a car, she can’t easily get to a grocery
store to use them.

transportation.

Treating hunger as a temporary emergency, instead of a symptom of
systemic problems, has always informed the American response to it — and
as a result government programs have been designed to alleviate each
peak, rather than address the factors that produce them.

Food banks are supposed to fill in the gaps, but more than 37 million
Americans are food insecure, according to the U.S.D.A. “We call it an
emergency food system, but it’s a 50-year emergency,” says Noreen
Springstead, executive director of WhyHunger, which supports grass-roots
food organizations.

Kelly Rivera, a single mother with three kids who makes $688 every two
weeks as a teacher’s aide, goes to the food bank on Wednesdays to
supplement what she is able to buy with food stamps. “There are times
they give you what you need, and there are times they don’t give you
what you need,” she says. “You can’t be picky.”

Hatch, N.M.

<div>

July 13

</div>

</div>

Some 800 miles west in New Mexico, near the town of Hatch, workers pick
onions for $15 a box, which translates to less than a minimum wage for
many workers. There are no food pantries nearby, and so the workers are
forced to eat extremely simply on their earnings, making nearly
everything they eat from scratch.
