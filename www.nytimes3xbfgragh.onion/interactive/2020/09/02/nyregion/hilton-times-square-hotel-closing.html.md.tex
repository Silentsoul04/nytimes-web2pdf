A Popular Times Square Hotel Closes, and 200 Workers Lose Their Jobs

Not even a location a block away from the ``crossroads of the world''
could save the Hilton Times Square from the pandemic. The owner of the
478-room hotel on 42nd Street said it would close permanently next month

New York's hotels have been devastated by the coronavirus outbreak.

Only about one-third of rooms have been occupied in recent weeks,
according to STR, an industry analyst. That's a drop of nearly 60
percent from the same period last year. Among U.S. cities, only
Honolulu's hotels have lost more business.

The Hilton's closing means about 200 workers who have been furloughed
since March will lose their jobs permanently.

And the city's main hotel union says that only about 6,000 of its 39,000
members are working.

The company that owns the Hilton, Sunstone Hotel Investors, has 19
hotels in New York City, but only nine are currently open. Sunstone has
said its hotels in Boston, Chicago and New Orleans have rebounded
faster.

Its chief executive, John Arabia, told investors last month that New
York was ``a market that I think is going to struggle for some time.''

Sal Marciante, who has tended bars in other Manhattan hotels for 40
years, told me he did not expect to return to work until tourists come
back to the city.
