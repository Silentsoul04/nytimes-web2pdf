It was no small feat to assemble the world's greatest tennis players for
the U.S. Open, which began last week before empty stands at the Billie
Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. Here's a general
what-to-know →

With athletes representing 56 countries, there were a number of
logistical challenges that had to be surmounted to ensure everyone's
safety. Some players --- such as Rafael Nadal, Ashleigh Barty and Simona
Halep --- chose to skip.

Because of the nature of a knockout tournament, it's difficult to
predict who will make deep runs as the Open unfolds. But mark your
calendar regardless:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The women's singles semifinals will be played at Arthur Ashe Stadium
  on Thursday, at 7 p.m. Eastern on ESPN.
\item
  The following day, at 4 p.m. on ESPN2 and moving to ESPN at 7 p.m.,
  the four men's singles semifinalists will duke it out for spots in the
  final.
\end{itemize}

  Saturday will be the women's final, with the men's on Sunday. Both
  will air at 4 p.m. on ESPN and can be streamed through the ESPN app or
  on ESPN3.com.
\end{itemize}

Right after the tournament's completion, most of the athletes are off to
the red clay courts of Europe. The weeklong Masters tournament in Rome,
for both men and women, begins Sept. 14.

The tours then split on Sept. 21, when the men head to the Hamburg Open
in Germany and the women head to the Strasbourg Grand Prix in France.
You can watch these through ESPN.

On Sept. 27, the French Open begins, and with it, spectators return. Up
to 20,000 people will be allowed on the grounds of Stade Roland Garros
in Paris.

On the courts, look for Nadal as he returns to his favored grounds, as
well as Barty, who is hoping to repeat her 2019 title. The French Open
wraps up Oct. 11, a mere four months behind schedule.
