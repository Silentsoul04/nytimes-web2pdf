There's a grand tradition at The New York Times that when people travel
to another city or nation or region, they reach out to a reporter who
works there for advice. They ask the food editor for recommendations as
well, the travel editor, the art critic, the science writer who knows
all about rain forests. These requests come often enough that some make
lists --- where to eat in Seoul, which museum to visit in Berlin.
Journalists do this even when they're cooped up during a pandemic, but
about different things, of course. They take notes, casual but not ---
what to listen to, what to read, which workout to try. These notes,
often assembled in shareable documents, reveal something of themselves
and the work that they do. They are delightful, informative, helpful,
low-fi insights into the worlds they inhabit. And at this extraordinary
time, we thought we'd share them with you.
