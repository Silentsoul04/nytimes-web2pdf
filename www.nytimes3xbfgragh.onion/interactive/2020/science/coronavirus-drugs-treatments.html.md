The Covid-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges modern medicine
has ever faced. Doctors and scientists are scrambling to find treatments
and drugs that can save the lives of infected people and perhaps even

Below is an updated list of **21 of the most-talked-about treatments for
the coronavirus**. While some are accumulating evidence that they’re
effective, most are still at early stages of research. We also included
a warning about a few that are just
bunk.

There is no cure yet for Covid-19. And even the most promising
treatments to date only help certain groups of patients and await
validation from further trials. The F.D.A. has not fully licensed any
treatment specifically for the coronavirus. Although it has granted
[emergency use
authorization](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization)
to some treatments, their effectiveness against Covid-19 has yet to be
demonstrated in large-scale, randomized clinical trials.

<span class="g-wide">WIDELY USED</span>: These treatments have been used
widely by doctors and nurses to treat patients hospitalized for diseases
that affect the respiratory system, including Covid-19.

<span class="g-promising">PROMISING EVIDENCE</span>: Early evidence from
studies on patients suggests effectiveness, but more research is needed.
This category includes treatments that have shown improvements in
morbidity, mortality and recovery in at least one randomized controlled
trial, in which some people get a treatment and others get a placebo.

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>: Some
treatments show promising results in cells or animals, which need to be
confirmed in people. Others have yielded encouraging results in
retrospective studies in humans, which look at existing datasets rather
than starting a new trial. Some treatments have produced different
results in different experiments, raising the need for larger, more
rigorously designed studies to clear up the confusion.

<span class="g-not">NOT PROMISING</span>: Early evidence suggests that
these treatments do not work.

<span class="g-fraud">PSEUDOSCIENCE OR FRAUD</span>: These are not
treatments that researchers have ever considered using for Covid-19.
Experts have warned against trying them, because they do not help
against the disease and can instead be dangerous. Some people have even
been arrested for their false promises of a Covid-19 cure.

<span class="g-franklin"></span><span class="g-cells">EVIDENCE IN
CELLS</span>, <span class="g-animals">ANIMALS</span> or

evidence for a treatment comes from. Researchers often start out with
experiments on cells and then move onto animals. Many of those animal
experiments often fail; if they don’t, researchers may consider moving
on to research on humans, such as retrospective studies or randomized
clinical trials. In some cases, scientists are testing out treatments
that were developed for other diseases, allowing them to move directly
to human trials for Covid-19.

[Remdesivir](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/health/coronavirus-remdesivir.html),
made by Gilead Sciences, was the first drug to get emergency
authorization from the F.D.A. for use on Covid-19. It interferes with
the creation of new viruses by inserting itself into new viral genes.
Remdesivir was originally tested as an antiviral against Ebola and
Hepatitis C, only to deliver lackluster results. But a randomized
controlled trial published in May concluded the drug reduced the
recovery time of people hospitalized with Covid-19 from [15 to 11
days](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007764). (The study
defined recovery as “either discharge from the hospital or
hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.”) The trial did not
show any effect on mortality, though retrospective data released in July
hints that the drug might [reduce death
rates](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/7/gilead-presents-additional-data-on-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19)
among those who are very ill.  
  
The F.D.A. responded to this data in May by
[issuing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-remdesivir.html)
an emergency authorization in May for remdesivir’s use in critically ill
patients who need supplemental oxygen. In August, they expanded that
approval after researchers found that patients with less severe forms of
Covid-19 [seemed to benefit modestly from a five-day treatment course of
remdesivir. The revised approval allows the use of the drug
on](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769871) all
patients hospitalized with Covid-19, regardless of how severe their
disease is. The move was [criticized by some
experts](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/08/28/fda-ignores-science-expanding-remdesivir-treat-covid-19/5662305002/)
who said the F.D.A. had expanded remdesivir’s use without strong

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>
<span class="g-humans">EVIDENCE IN CELLS AND HUMANS</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Ivermectin</span>  
For decades, ivermectin has served as a potent drug to treat parasitic
worms. Doctors use it against river blindness and other diseases, while
veterinarians give dogs a different formulation to cure heartworm.
Studies on cells have suggested ivermectin might also kill viruses. But
scientists have yet to find evidence in animal studies or human trials
that it can treat viral diseases. As a result, Ivermectin is not
approved to use as an antiviral.  
  
In April, Australian researchers
[reported](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011)
that the drug blocked coronaviruses in cell cultures, but they used a
dosage that was so high it might have dangerous side effects in people.
The FDA immediately issued a
[warning](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/fda-letter-stakeholders-do-not-use-ivermectin-intended-animals-treatment-covid-19-humans)
against taking pet medications to treat or prevent Covid-19. “These
animal drugs can cause serious harm in people,” the agency warned.  
  
Since then a number of clinical trials have been launched to see if a
safe dose of ivermectin can fight Covid-19. In Singapore, for example,
the National University Hospital is running a 5,000-person
[trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04446104) to see if it
can prevent people from getting infected. As of now, there’s no firm
evidence that it works. Nevertheless ivermectin is being prescribed

[Oleandrin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/20/health/covid-oleandrin-trump-mypillow.html)
is a compound produced by the oleander shrub. It can cause irregular
heartbeats, making the plant dangerous to ingest. But many plant
compounds — even some potentially lethal ones — have proven to be
medically useful, and so researchers have investigated oleandrin as a
potential treatment for cancer. The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute
of Infectious Diseases tested oleandrin on coronavirus-infected cells in
May but the experiments were inconclusive. Researchers at Phoenix
Biotechnology, a San-Antonio based company, and the University of Texas
Medical Branch at Galveston then released a
[study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.203489v1.abstract)
finding that it was effective in a culture of monkey kidney cells
infected with the coronavirus. The study has not yet been published in a
scientific journal.  
  
In July, Mike Lindell, the chief executive of My Pillow, a donor to
President Trump and a Phoenix investor, attended a meeting at the White
House to discuss oleandrin’s use against Covid-19.  
  
But most compounds that kill viruses in cell cultures fail in further
testing in animals or humans. What’s more, experts worry about the
safety of oleandrin as a treatment for the coronavirus, given the
toxicity of the plant. Phoenix Biotechnology is considering selling
oleandrin as an over-the-counter supplement. Consumers should be aware
that there is no evidence that it’s safe or effective against the
coronavirus in people.

Twenty years ago, the F.D.A. approved this combination of drugs to treat

studies to see if the drugs could help patients not sick enough to be
hospitalized, or to prevent people exposed to the new coronavirus from
falling ill. The drug could also still have a role to play in certain

<span class="g-not">NOT PROMISING</span> <span class="g-humans">EVIDENCE

<span class="g-tname">Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine</span>  
German chemists synthesized chloroquine in the 1930s as a drug against
malaria. A less toxic version, called hydroxychloroquine, was [invented
in 1946](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0156-0#:~:text=Hydroxychloroquine%20\(HCQ\)%20sulfate%2C%20a,than%20CQ%20in%20animals4.),
and later was approved for other diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers discovered
that both drugs could stop the coronavirus from replicating in cells.  
  
Since then, they’ve had a tumultuous ride. A few small studies on
patients offered some hope that hydroxychloroquine could treat Covid-19.
The World Health Organization launched a randomized clinical trial in
March to see if it was indeed safe and effective for Covid-19, as did
Novartis and a number of universities. Meanwhile, President Trump
repeatedly [promoted
hydroxychloroquine](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-malaria-drug.html)
at press conferences, touting it as a “game changer,” and even [took it
himself](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/18/us/politics/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-coronavirus.html).
The F.D.A. temporarily granted hydroxychloroquine emergency
authorization for use in Covid-19 patients — which a whistleblower later
[claimed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/fda-eua-hydroxychloroquine-chloroquine)
was the result of political pressure. In the wake of the drug’s newfound
publicity, [demand
spiked](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/world/covid-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=2#link-33c05fc5),

for people who rely on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for other
diseases.  
  
But more detailed studies proved disappointing. Studies on animals such
as monkeys and mice found [no
evidence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17907-w) that
hydroxychloroquine stopped the disease. Randomized clinical trials found
that hydroxychloroquine [didn’t help people with Covid-19 get

or [prevent healthy people from contracting the

Another [randomized clinical
trial](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-4207) found that
giving hydroxychloroquine to people right after being diagnosed with
Covid-19 didn’t reduce the severity of their disease. (One large-scale
study that concluded the drug was harmful as well was later
[retracted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/04/health/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine.html?searchResultPosition=1).)
The [World Health
Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/04-07-2020-who-discontinues-hydroxychloroquine-and-lopinavir-ritonavir-treatment-arms-for-covid-19),
the National Institutes of Health and Novartis have since halted trials
investigating hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, and the
F.D.A. [revoked its emergency
approval](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/health/fda-hydroxychloroquine-malaria.html).
The F.D.A. now
[warns](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or)
that the drug can cause a host of serious side effects to the heart and
other organs when used to treat Covid-19.  
  
In July, researchers at Henry Ford hospital in Detroit published a
[study](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/08/a-flawed-covid-19-study-gets-the-white-houses-attention-and-the-fda-may-pay-the-price/)
finding that hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduction in
mortality in Covid-19 patients. President Trump [praised the study on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280328830218051584),
but experts raised
[doubts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305300?dgcid=rss_sd_all)
about it. The study was not a randomized controlled trial, in which some
people got a placebo instead of hydroxychloroquine. The study’s results
might not be due to the drug killing the virus. Instead, doctors may
have given the drug to people who were less sick, and thus more likely
to recover anyway.  
  
Despite negative results, a number of hydroxychloroquine trials have
continued, although most are small, testing a few dozen or a few hundred
patients. A recent analysis by STAT and Applied XL found more than 180
[ongoing clinical
trials](https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/06/data-show-panic-and-disorganization-dominate-the-study-of-covid-19-drugs/)
testing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, for treating or preventing
Covid-19. Although it’s clear the drugs are no panacea, it’s
theoretically possible they could provide some benefit in combination
with other treatments, or when given in early stages of the disease.
Only well-designed trials can determine if that’s the case.

<span class="g-tname">Convalescent plasma</span>  
A century ago, doctors filtered plasma from the blood of recovered flu
patients. So-called convalescent plasma, rich with antibodies, helped
people sick with flu fight their illness. Now researchers are trying out
this
[strategy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/smarter-living/coronavirus-convalescent-plasma-antibodies.html?searchResultPosition=1)
on Covid-19. Tens of thousands of patients in the U.S. have received
plasma through a program launched by the Mayo Clinic and the federal
government.  
  
The Trump administration has praised convalescent plasma, despite the
lack of evidence yet that it works. In August, [top government
scientists reportedly
stopped](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/19/us/politics/blood-plasma-covid-19.html?smid=tw-share)
the F.D.A. from giving emergency authorization to convalescent plasma,
arguing the evidence was still too weak for such a step. But President
Trump announced on August 23 that the authorization would go ahead — a
move that generated immediate
[controversy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/23/us/politics/fda-plasma-coronavirus.html).
In a
[statement](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/statement-on-convalescent-plasma-eua/),
the N.I.H.’s Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel underscored the
importance of further investigation on convalescent plasma’s
effectiveness. Despite the F.D.A.’s emergency authorization, the panel
said “there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the
use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of Covid-19.”  
  
A study of the Mayo Clinic’s program suggested that the treatment
provided a modest benefit, but only to patients who got treated early in
their disease with plasma packed with high levels of antibodies.
[Outside
experts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/health/fda-blood-plasma.html)
warned that only randomized clinical trials could confirm such a
benefit. So far, the only such trials to produce results have been
[small](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/health/coronarvirus-convalescent-serum.html?searchResultPosition=2),
and their results have been mixed.  
  
Large randomized clinical trials are underway, but they’ve [struggled to
enroll enough
participants](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/trump-plasma.html),
some of whom worry they will receive a placebo instead of the treatment
itself. Experts say that it’s vital to complete these trials to
determine if convalescent plasma is safe and effective. The treatment
may only be a stopgap measure until more potent therapies become widely
available.

Convalescent plasma from people who recover from Covid-19 contains a mix
of different antibodies. Some of the molecules can attack the
coronavirus, but many are directed at other pathogens. Researchers have
sifted through this slurry to find the most potent antibodies against
Covid-19. They have then manufactured synthetic copies of these
molecules, known as monoclonal antibodies. Researchers have begun
investigating them as a treatment for Covid-19, either individually or
in cocktails.  
  
Monoclonal antibodies were first developed as a therapy in the 1970s,
and since then the F.D.A. has approved them for [79
diseases](https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z),
ranging from cancer to AIDS. Since the start of the pandemic,

Interferons are molecules our cells naturally produce in response to
viruses. They have profound effects on the immune system, rousing it to
attack the invaders, while also reining it in to avoid damaging the
body’s own tissues. Injecting synthetic interferons is now a standard
treatment for a number of immune disorders.
[Rebif](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Rebif),
for example, is prescribed for multiple sclerosis.  
  
As part of its strategy to attack our bodies, the coronavirus appears to
[tamp down
interferon](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html).
That finding has encouraged researchers to see whether a boost of
interferon might help people weather Covid-19, particularly early in
infection. Early studies, including experiments in
[cells](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa350/5860074)
and [mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32511406/), have yielded
encouraging results that have led to clinical trials.  
  
An open-label study in China suggested that the molecules could [help

<span class="xg-balancer" data-id="21">The most severe symptoms of
Covid-19 are the result of the immune system’s overreaction to the
virus. Scientists are testing drugs that can rein in its attack.</span>

<span id="corticosteroids"></span>

<span class="g-promising">PROMISING EVIDENCE</span>
<span class="g-humans">EVIDENCE IN HUMANS</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Dexamethasone and Other Corticosteroids</span>  
Corticosteroids — often called steroids for short — are used to tamp
down inflammation and for conditions such as allergies and asthma. In
the 1960s, doctors began using them as a treatment for pneumonia and
other severe respiratory illnesses, but the results of clinical trials
were inconclusive. The Covid-19 pandemic brought a new interest in these
drugs, and a raft of new clinical trials were launched.  
  
In June, a steroid called dexamethasone was the first shown to [reduce
Covid-19
deaths](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/world/europe/dexamethasone-coronavirus-covid.html?searchResultPosition=5).
A
[study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2021436?query=featured_home)
of more than 6,000 people found that dexamethasone reduced deaths by
one-third in patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth in patients on
oxygen. It may be [less likely to
help](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/health/coronavirus-dexamethasone.html?searchResultPosition=2)
— and may even harm — patients who are at an earlier stage of Covid-19
infections, however. In its Covid-19 treatment guidelines, the National
Institutes of Health
[recommends](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/dexamethasone/)
only using dexamethasone in patients with Covid-19 who are on a
ventilator or are receiving supplemental oxygen.  
  
In September, researchers reviewed the results of trials on
dexamethasone, along with two other steroids, hydrocortisone and
methylprednisolone. Overall, [they
concluded](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/health/coronavirus-steroids-who.html),
steroids were linked with a one-third reduction in deaths among Covid-19
patients.

<span id="cytokine"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>
<span class="g-humans">EVIDENCE IN HUMANS</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Cytokine Inhibitors</span>  
The body produces signaling molecules called cytokines to fight off
diseases. But manufactured in excess, cytokines can trigger the immune
system to wildly overreact to infections, in a process sometimes called
a cytokine storm. Researchers have created a number of drugs to halt
cytokine storms, and they have proven effective against arthritis and
other inflammatory disorders. Some turn off the supply of molecules that
launch the production of the cytokines themselves. Others block the
receptors on immune cells to which cytokines would normally bind. A few
block the cellular messages they send. Depending on how the drugs are
formulated, they can block one cytokine at a time, or muffle signals
from several at once.  
  
Against the coronavirus, several of these drugs have [offered modest
help](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.01.20119149v2) in
some trials, but faltered in others. Drug companies Regeneron and Roche
drug both

[announced](https://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2020-07-29.htm)
that two drugs called sarilumab and tocilizumab, which both target the
cytokine IL-6, did not appear to benefit patients in Phase 3 clinical
trials. Many other trials remain underway, several of which combine
cytokine inhibitors with other treatments.

<span class="g-humans">EVIDENCE IN HUMANS</span>
<span class="g-emergency">EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Blood filtration systems</span>  
The F.D.A. has [granted emergency use
authorization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/10/health/stephen-hahn-fda.html)
to several devices that [filter
cytokines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm.html)
from the blood in an attempt to cool [cytokine
storms](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm.html).
One machine, called Cytosorb, can reportedly purify a patient’s entire
blood supply about 70 times in a 24-hour period. A small study in March
suggested that Cytosorb had helped dozens of severely ill Covid-19
patients in Europe and China, but it was not a randomized clinical trial
that could conclusively demonstrate it was effective. A number of
studies on blood filtration systems are underway, but experts caution
that these devices carry some risks. For example, such filters could
[remove beneficial
components](https://www.fda.gov/media/136866/download) of blood as well,
such as vitamins or medications.

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>
<span class="g-humans">EVIDENCE IN HUMANS</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Stem cells</span>  
Certain kinds of stem cells can secrete anti-inflammatory molecules.
Over the years, researchers have tried to use them as a [treatment for
cytokine
storms](https://celltrials.org/news/role-msc-treat-coronavirus-pneumonia-and-ards-part-1-is-emperor-wearing-clothes),
and now dozens of clinical
[trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=stem+cell&cond=COVID-19&age_v=&gndr=&type=&rslt=&phase=0&phase=1&phase=2&phase=3&Search=Apply)
are under way to see if they can help patients with Covid-19. But these
stem cell treatments haven’t worked well in the past, and it’s not clear
yet if they’ll work against the coronavirus.

## <span class="xg-balancer" data-id="22">Other Treatments</span>

<span class="xg-balancer" data-id="23">Doctors and nurses often
administer other supportive treatments to help patients with
Covid-19.</span>

<span id="prone"></span>

<span class="g-wide">WIDELY USED</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Prone positioning</span>  
The simple act of flipping Covid-19 patients onto their bellies [opens
up the
lungs](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/health/coronavirus-proning-lungs.html).
The maneuver has become commonplace in hospitals around the world since
the start of the pandemic. It might help some individuals avoid the need
for ventilators entirely. The treatment’s benefits continue to be tested
in a range of clinical trials.

<span id="ventilators"></span>

<span class="g-wide">WIDELY USED</span>
<span class="g-emergency">EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Ventilators and other respiratory support
devices</span>  
Devices that help people breathe are an essential tool in the fight
against deadly respiratory illnesses. Some patients do well if they get
an extra supply of oxygen through the nose or via a mask connected to an
oxygen machine. Patients in severe respiratory distress may need to have
a [ventilator breathe for
them](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/08/health/coronavirus-covid-lungs-ventilators.html)
until their lungs heal. Doctors are divided about how long to treat
patients with noninvasive oxygen before deciding whether or not they
need a ventilator. Not all Covid-19 patients who go on ventilators
survive, but the devices are thought to be [lifesaving in many
cases](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/26/health/coronavirus-patient-ventilator.html).

<span id="anticoagulants"></span>

<span class="g-mixed">TENTATIVE OR MIXED EVIDENCE</span>
<span class="g-humans">EVIDENCE IN HUMANS</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Anticoagulants</span>  
The coronavirus can invade cells in the lining of blood vessels, leading
to tiny clots that can cause strokes and other serious harm.
Anticoagulants are commonly used for other conditions, such as heart
disease, to slow the formation of clots, and doctors sometimes use them
on patients with Covid-19 who have clots. Many clinical trials teasing
out this relationship are now underway. Some of these trials are looking
at whether giving anticoagulants before any sign of clotting is
beneficial.

## <span class="xg-balancer" data-id="24">Pseudoscience and Fraud</span>

<span class="xg-balancer" data-id="25">False claims about Covid-19 cures
abound. The F.D.A. maintains a
[list](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products)
of more than 100 fraudulent Covid-19 products, and the W.H.O.
[debunks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters)
many myths about the disease.</span>

<span id="bleach"></span>

<span class="g-fraud">WARNING: DO NOT DO THIS</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Drinking or injecting bleach and
disinfectants</span>  
Disinfectants can help slow the spread of the coronavirus, but only when
used properly. The CDC offers
[guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html)
for cleaning your house and hands. Washing with soap is the best way to
keep your hands clean, but alcohol-based sanitizers [will
do](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/hand-hygiene.html) if
you’re not near a sink.  
  
It’s important to only use the right products. Never mix bleach and
ammonia to disinfect surfaces, for example, because it can release toxic
gas. As for
[hand-sanitizers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/hand-hygiene.html),
make sure to use brands with greater than 60% ethanol or 70%
isopropanol. The FDA has
[warned](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-reiterates-warning-about-dangerous-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizers)
that some sanitizers contain wood alcohol, or methanol, which can be
dangerous.  
  
In April, President Trump
[suggested](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/health/sunlight-coronavirus-trump.html)
that disinfectants such as alcohol or bleach might be effective against
the coronavirus if directly injected into the body. His comments were
immediately
[refuted](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html)
by health professionals and researchers around the world — as well as
the [makers of Lysol and
Clorox](https://www.prweek.com/article/1681380/lysol-clorox-respond-trump-comment-injecting-disinfectant).
In July, Federal prosecutors

<span class="g-fraud">WARNING: NO EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">UV light</span>  
President Trump also
[speculated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/health/sunlight-coronavirus-trump.html)
about hitting the body with “ultraviolet or just very powerful light.”
Researchers have used UV light to sterilize surfaces, including killing
viruses, in carefully managed laboratories. But UV light would not be
able to purge the virus from within a sick persons’ body. This kind of
radiation can also damage the skin. Most skin cancers are a result of
exposure to the UV rays naturally present in sunlight.

<span id="silver"></span>

<span class="g-fraud">WARNING: NO EVIDENCE</span>  
<span class="g-tname">Silver</span>  
In July, Utah resident Gordon Pedersen was
[indicted](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/press-releases/utah-man-posing-medical-doctor-sell-baseless-coronavirus-cure-indicted-fraud-charges)
for “posing as a medical doctor to sell a baseless treatment for
coronavirus.” Mr. Pedersen alleged crime was peddling lozenges, lotions
and soaps containing silver. Several metals do have [natural
antimicrobial
properties,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/copper-coronavirus-masks.html)
but none has been shown effective against the coronavirus. As for
silver, the National Institutes of Health
[warns](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/colloidal-silver) that
“scientific evidence doesn’t support the use of colloidal silver
dietary supplements for any disease or condition.” It can also be
dangerous, causing people’s skin to turn blue and making it difficult
for them to absorb antibiotics and other drugs.  
  
Mr. Pedersen is not alone. The F.D.A. has threatened legal action
against a host of other people claiming silver-based products are safe
and effective against Covid-19 — including televangelist [Jim
Bakker](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/jim-bakker-show-604820-03062020)
and InfoWars host [Alex

<span id="note"></span><span class="g-sync">Note: After additional
discussions with experts we have adjusted several labels on the tracker.
The “<span style="font-weight: 600;">Strong evidence</span>” label has
been removed until further research identifies treatments that
consistently benefit groups of patients infected by the coronavirus. In
its place, “<span style="font-weight: 600;">Promising evidence</span>”
will be used for drugs such as remdesivir and dexamethasone that have
shown promise in at least one randomized controlled trial, and
“<span style="font-weight: 600;">Widely used</span>” for treatments
such as proning and ventilators that are often used with severely ill
patients, including those with Covid-19. And we may reintroduce the
“<span style="font-weight: 600;">Ineffective</span>” label when
ongoing clinical trials repeatedly end with disappointing
results.</span>
