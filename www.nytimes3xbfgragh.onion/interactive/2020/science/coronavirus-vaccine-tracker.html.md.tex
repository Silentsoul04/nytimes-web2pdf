Vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching
the clinic, but scientists are racing to produce a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html}{safe
and effective coronavirus vaccine} by next year. Researchers are testing
\textbf{\textbf{38 vaccines}} in clinical trials on humans, and at least
93 preclinical vaccines are

Work began in January with the deciphering of the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html}{SARS-CoV-2
genome}. The first vaccine safety trials in humans started in March, but
the road ahead remains uncertain. Some trials will fail, and others may
end without a clear result. But a few may succeed in stimulating the
immune system to produce effective antibodies against the virus.

Here is the status of all the vaccines that have reached trials in
humans, along with a selection of promising vaccines still being tested
in cells or animals.

\hypertarget{the-vaccine-testing-process}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{The Vaccine Testing
Process}}{The Vaccine Testing Process}}\label{the-vaccine-testing-process}}

\emph{The development cycle of a vaccine, from lab to clinic.}

PRECLINICAL TESTING: Scientists test a new vaccine on cells and then
give it to \textbf{\textbf{animals}} such as mice or monkeys to see if
it produces an immune response. We have confirmed 93 preclinical
vaccines in active development.

PHASE 1 SAFETY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to a
\textbf{\textbf{small number of people}} to test safety and dosage as
well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system.

PHASE 2 EXPANDED TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to
\textbf{\textbf{hundreds of people}} split into groups, such as children
and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. These
trials further test the vaccine's safety and ability to stimulate the
immune system.

PHASE 3 EFFICACY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to
\textbf{\textbf{thousands of people}} and wait to see how many become
infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials
can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. In June,
the F.D.A. said that a coronavirus vaccine would have to
\href{https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-action-help-facilitate-timely-development-safe-effective-covid}{protect
at least 50\% of vaccinated people} to be considered effective. In
addition, Phase 3 trials are large enough to reveal evidence of
relatively rare side effects that might be missed in earlier studies.

EARLY OR LIMITED APPROVAL: \protect\hyperlink{cansino}{China} and
\protect\hyperlink{gamaleya}{Russia} have approved vaccines without
waiting for the results of Phase 3 trials. Experts say the rushed
process has
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/health/russia-covid-19-vaccine-safety.html}{serious
risks}.

APPROVAL: Regulators in each country review the trial results and decide
whether to approve the vaccine or not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may
receive emergency use authorization before getting formal approval. Once
a vaccine is licensed, researchers continue to monitor people who
receive it to make sure it's safe and effective.

COMBINED PHASES: One way to
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html}{accelerate
vaccine development} is to combine phases. Some coronavirus vaccines are
now in Phase 1/2 trials, for example, in which they are tested for the
first time on hundreds of people. (Note that our tracker would count a
combined Phase 1/2 trial as both Phase 1 and Phase 2.)

\textbf{\textbf{Moderna}} develops vaccines based on messenger RNA
(mRNA) to produce viral proteins in the body. They have yet to bring one
to the market. In January, they began developing a vaccine for the
coronavirus and since then the government has bankrolled Moderna's
efforts, providing nearly \$1 billion. In partnership with
\textbf{\textbf{National Institutes of Health}}, they found that the
vaccine
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/health/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-monkeys.html}{protects
monkeys} from the coronavirus. In March, the company
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html}{put
the first Covid-19 vaccine into human trials}, which yielded
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/world/coronavirus-update.html\#link-751c8321}{promising
results}. The vaccine has progressed into Phase 3 testing, which
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/27/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html\#link-6509720d}{began}
on July 27. The final trial is enrolling 30,000 healthy people at about
89 sites around the United States. On August 11, the government
\href{https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200811005852/en/Moderna-Announces-Supply-Agreement-U.S.-Government-Initial}{awarded}
the company an additional \$1.5 billion in exchange for 100 million
doses if the vaccine proves safe and effective.

In July, Moderna
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/08/11/us/11reuters-health-coronavirus-moderna.html?searchResultPosition=1}{lost}
a patent dispute over some of their vaccine technology. The following
month, the company
\href{https://www.axios.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-sec-disclosure-c8c491d1-0395-4c9d-8bf4-792246c6aa34.html}{stated}
that it could not be certain it was the first to make the inventions
claimed in their patents, including its coronavirus vaccine.\\

The German company \textbf{\textbf{BioNTech}} entered into
collaborations with \textbf{\textbf{Pfizer}}, based in New York, and the
Chinese drug maker \textbf{\textbf{Fosun Pharma}} to develop an mRNA
vaccine. In May they launched a Phase 1/2 trial on two versions of the
vaccine. They \href{https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176651}{found}
that both versions caused volunteers to produce antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2, as well as immune cells called T cells that respond to the
virus. They found that one version, called BNT162b2, produced
significantly fewer side effects, such as fevers and fatigue, and so
they chose it to move into Phase 2/3 trials. On July 27, the companies
announced the
\href{https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200727005800/en/Pfizer-BioNTech-Choose-Lead-mRNA-Vaccine-Candidate}{launch}
of a Phase 2/3 trial with 30,000 volunteers in the United States and
other countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Germany.

In that same month, the Trump administration
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/22/us/politics/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{awarded}
a \$1.9 billion contract for 100 million doses to be delivered by
December and the option to acquire 500 million more doses. Meanwhile,
Japan made a
\href{https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-supply-japan-120-million-doses-their}{deal}
for 120 million doses, and the European Union
\href{https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-potentially-supply-eu-200-million-doses}{arranged}
to purchase 200 million doses.

In September, the chief executive of Pfizer
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/09/03/world/europe/03reuters-health-coronavirus-drugs.html}{said}
they would know if the vaccine works as soon as October 2020. If
approved, Pfizer has
\href{https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-supply-canada-their-bnt162-mrna-based}{said}
they expect to manufacture over 1.3 billion doses of their vaccine

The \textbf{\textbf{Gamaleya Research Institute}}, part of Russia's
Ministry of Health, launched clinical trials in June of a vaccine they
called Gam-Covid-Vac. It is a combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and
Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene.

On Aug. 11, President Vladimir V. Putin
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html\#link-b092b4d}{announced}
that a Russian health care regulator had
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine.html}{approved

Vaccine experts
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/11/health/russia-covid-19-vaccine-safety.html}{decried}
the move as risky, and Russia later
\href{https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-announces-expanded-trials-coronavirus-vaccine-approved-10/story?id=72497297}{walked
back} the announcement, saying that the approval was a ``conditional
registration certificate,'' which would depend on positive results from
Phase 3 trials. Those trials, initially planned for just 2,000
volunteers,

A vaccine from Australia's \textbf{\textbf{University of Queensland}}
delivers viral proteins altered to draw a stronger immune response.
\href{https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2020/08/uq-vaccine-scientists-report-positive-results-pre-clinical-testing}{Experiments
on hamsters} showed that the vaccine protected them from the
coronavirus. The university launched Phase 1 trials in July, combining
the proteins with an adjuvant made by \textbf{\textbf{CSL}}. If the
results are positive, CSL will advance late stage clinical trials by the
end of 2020. In September the vaccine makers
\href{https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2020/09/csl-signs-agreement-australian-government-uq-vaccine-supply}{reached
an agreement} with the Australian government to deliver 51 million doses
if the trials deliver positive results. They expected their first supply
of the vaccines to be ready in mid-2021.\\

A second tobacco-based vaccine is in development at
\textbf{\textbf{Kentucky BioProcessing}}, an American subsidiary of
British American Tobacco, the maker of Lucky Strike and other
cigarettes. Like Medicago, Kentucky BioProcessing engineers a species of
tobacco called Nicotiana benthamiana to make viral proteins. The company
previously used this technique to make a drug called Zmapp for Ebola.
After preclinical testing in the spring, they registered a Phase 1 trial
for their coronavirus vaccine in July.\\

In July, researchers at \textbf{\textbf{West China Hospital of Sichuan
University}} published a
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2599-8}{study} in
Nature describing a vaccine made from the RBD region of the spike
protein that could protect mice and monkeys from the coronavirus. On
August 24, they got
\href{http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-08/26/c_81483.htm}{approval} to run a
Phase 1 trial. To make the vaccine, researchers encode the RBD region in
a gene, which they insert into a virus. They then infect insect cells
with the virus, causing them to make the molecule in huge amounts.\\

In addition to their mRNA vaccine, \textbf{\textbf{Sanofi}} developed a
Covid-19 vaccine based on viral proteins. They produced the proteins
with engineered viruses that grow inside insect cells.
\textbf{\textbf{GSK}} supplemented these proteins with adjuvants that
stimulate the immune system. The vaccine is based on the same design
Sanofi used to create
\href{https://sanofiflu.com/flublok-quadrivalent-influenza-vaccine.html}{Flublok},
an approved vaccine for infuenza. The companies
\href{https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-09-03-07-00-00}{launched}
a Phase 1 clinical trial in September, with plans to start Phase 3
trials in December.

Even before their clinical trials began, Sanofi had negotiated several
deals to supply the vaccine. They reached an
\href{https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-07-29-07-00-00}{agreement}
with the British government to provide up to 60 million doses if the
vaccine succeeds in trials. Meanwhile, the United
States\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/31/health/covid-19-vaccine-sanofi-gsk.html}{agreed
to pay the companies} \$2.1 billion for 100 million doses. In addition,
Sanofi agreed to provide much of its global supply to COVAX, an
international collaboration to deliver the vaccine equitably across the
world.

In September, Sanofi said that if their trials produced positive results
they would request regulatory approval in the first half of 2021. They
have plans to make up to one billion doses in 2021.\\

On July 18, \textbf{\textbf{North Korea}}'s State Commission of Science
and Technology announced on their web site that they had started
clinical trials on a vaccine based on part of the coronavirus spike
protein. It's hard to independently determine how much truth there is in
the claim from the isolated dictatorship. The commission claimed to have
tested the vaccine on animals, but provided no data. What's more, it
stated that effectiveness trials would have to be carried out in another
country ``since there is no case of Covid-19 in DPR Korea.'' That's a
claim outside experts find
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/31/world/asia/north-korea-coronavirus.html}{highly
doubtful}.\\

After the SARS epidemic in 2002, \textbf{\textbf{Baylor College of
Medicine}} researchers began developing a vaccine that could prevent a
new outbreak. Despite promising early results, support for the research
disappeared. Because the coronaviruses that cause SARS and Covid-19 are
very similar, the researchers revived the project in partnership with
the \textbf{\textbf{Texas Children's Hospital}}. The researchers have
found that the Covid-19 vaccine produces antibodies in mice. In August,
the Indian company Biological E
\href{http://www.biologicale.com/news.html}{licensed it}, saying they
could potentially make a billion doses a year.\\

A vaccine in development by the \textbf{\textbf{University of
Pittsburgh}}, called PittCoVacc, is a skin patch tipped with 400 tiny

Note: Early versions of the tracker combined two vaccines by
\textbf{\protect\hyperlink{sinopharm}{Sinopharm}} into one entry.
Subsequent reporting confirmed they are two different vaccines. A
previous version of the tracker stated that Pfizer had reached a deal
with the EU, when in fact the deal was made by AstraZeneca.
