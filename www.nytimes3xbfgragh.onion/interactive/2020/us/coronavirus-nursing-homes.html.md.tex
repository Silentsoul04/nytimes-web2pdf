At least 68,000 residents and workers have died from the coronavirus at
nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for older adults in
the United States, according to a New York Times database. As of August
13, the virus has infected more than 402,000 people at some 17,000
facilities.

Nursing home populations are at a high risk of being infected by --- and
dying from --- the coronavirus, according to the
\href{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/long-term-care.html}{Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention}. Covid-19, the disease caused by the
coronavirus, is known to be particularly lethal to adults in their 60s
and older who have underlying health conditions. And it can
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html}{spread
more easily} through congregate facilities, where many people live in a
confined environment and workers move from room to room.

While 8 percent of the country's cases have occurred in long-term care
facilities, deaths related to Covid-19 in these facilities account for
more than 41 percent of the country's pandemic fatalities.

*In New York, the case count is often the same as the death count
because the state only reports the number of people who have died but
not the number of overall infections.·States with insufficient data to
calculate a share of Covid-19 deaths are shaded gray.

The share of deaths linked to long-term care facilities for older adults
is even starker at the state level. In 20 states, the number of
residents and workers who have died accounts for either half or more
than half of all deaths from the virus.

Infected people linked to nursing homes also die at a higher rate than
the general population. The median case fatality rate --- the number of
deaths divided by the number of cases --- at facilities with reliable
data is 16 percent, significantly higher than the 3 percent case
fatality rate nationwide.

The U.S. case fatality rate is 3\%.

The median case fatality rate in long-term care facilities is 16\%.

Note: Only facilities with reliable case and death data and at least 50
cases are included.

In the absence of comprehensive data from some states and the federal
government, The Times has been assembling its own database of
coronavirus cases and deaths at long-term care facilities for older
adults. These include nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, memory
care facilities, retirement and senior communities and rehabilitation
facilities. This tracker will be updated periodically.

Some states, including Colorado, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey and South
Carolina, regularly release cumulative data on cases and deaths at
specific facilities. New York regularly releases facility-level
information about deaths, but not about cases. Ohio, Wisconsin and
Minnesota, among others, provide some details on the number of cases at
specific facilities --- but not on deaths. Others report aggregate
totals for their states but provide no information on where the
infections or deaths have occurred. Some report very little or nothing
at all.

The Times's numbers are based on official confirmations from states,
counties and the facilities themselves, as well as some data provided by
the federal government. They include residents and, in cases in which
reporting is available, employees of the facilities. Given the wide
variability in the type of information available, the totals shown here
almost certainly represent an undercount of the true toll.

The New York Times is tracking the coronavirus at nursing homes and
long-term care centers. Do you or a family member live or work in one of
these facilities? If so,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/11/business/nursing-home-callout.html}{we
would like to hear from you}.

Here is a list of cases and deaths at long-term care facilities that
have had at least 50 cases. We are updating the numbers as we are able
to confirm them with state, county and facility officials.

Long-term care facility data is as of August 13 and will be updated
periodically. The New York Times's data is based on confirmed reports
from federal, state and local government sources, as well as facilities
themselves. The data may not match the numbers reported by any one
federal, state or local agency. The federal government, states, counties
and facilities report different portions of long-term care data, so
exercise caution when comparing facilities or aggregated data in
different states. The federal government and states frequently revise
their long-term care data up and down, for a variety of reasons.

\textbf{Correction:}~June 27, 2020

An earlier version of this article misstated the formula for case
fatality rate. It is the number of deaths divided by the number of
cases, not the number of cases divided by the number of deaths.

\textbf{Correction:}~July 8, 2020

An earlier version of this article transposed the national case fatality
rate and the median case fatality rate in nursing homes. As of July 8,
the national case fatality rate was 4 percent and the median case
fatality rate~in~nursing homes~was 17 percent, not the other way around.
