In a desperate race to stunt the spread of the coronavirus, millions of
Americans have been asked to do what would have been unthinkable only a
few months ago: Don’t go to work, don’t go to school, don’t leave the
house at all, unless you have to.

The directives to keep people at home, which [began in
California](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/us/coronavirus-california-stay-at-home-order.html)
in mid-March, quickly swept the nation. Today, residents in a vast
majority of states, [the Navajo
Nation](https://navajotimes.com/reznews/covid-cases-now-at-29-people-not-heeding-stay-at-home-warning/)
and many cities and counties are under instructions to stay at home as
much as possible, in an act of solidarity that public health experts say
is crucial to controlling the virus.

<div class="g-asset g-graphic g-summary" style="max-width: 600px">

This means at least <span class="sum-pop">316 million people</span> in
at least <span class="sum-state">42 states</span>,
<span class="sum-county">three counties</span>,
<span class="sum-city">10 cities</span>, <span class="sum-D.C.">the
District of Columbia</span> and <span class="sum-territory">Puerto
Rico</span> are being urged to stay home.

</div>

See how the directives spread across the country:

The orders — or lack thereof — have divided the American public. In a
handful of more rural states — Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota
and South Dakota — governors held off on imposing stay-at-home orders,
favoring other restrictions [amid intense pressure to take stricter
action](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/03/us/coronavirus-states-without-stay-home.html).
A few other states have partial orders in place, issued locally by
cities or counties.

In other states, the orders to stay at home have lasted for weeks,
drawing political ire and intensifying concerns about the economy. Some
conservative demonstrators have even taken to statehouses and city
streets, [in defiance of the stay-at-home orders they are
protesting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/16/us/coronavirus-rules-protests.html).

Still, the number of Americans under instructions to stay at home has
persisted at an astonishing level this spring, accounting for a stunning
95 percent of the population.

Here is a guide to how the orders affect each state in the list below.

### Alabama <span class="l-population">About 4.9 million people</span>

Gov. Kay Ivey had resisted a statewide order, saying that she wanted to
balance the health of the state's residents with the health of the
economy. "We are not California," she said on a conference call with
reporters, according to AL.com. But after Birmingham, the largest city
in the state, issued a shelter-in-place order for its residents, and
amid growing pressure, the governor issued a statewide order. “You need
to understand we are past urging people to stay at home," she said. "It
is now the law.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis, who for weeks resisted more stringent statewide
measures even as cities and counties took action, announced that he
would order the state’s more than 21 million residents to largely stay
at home. The governor said he started coming around to the necessity of
a statewide order once the White House extended national guidelines to
combat the coronavirus until April 30. “To me, that was, ’People aren’t
just going to back to work,’” Mr. DeSantis said at a news conference in
Tallahassee, the state capital. “That’s a national pause button.”

Atlanta and other areas. He said he made the decision, in part, after
learning that many people without symptoms are transmitting the virus.
"At this point," he said, "I think it's the right thing to do."

Hawaii, including leaving the house to go surfing and swimming. But the
governor's office said violations could be punishable by a fine of up to
$5,000, or as much as one year in jail. “The threat of COVID-19 is

Gov. Andy Beshear ordered all non-essential businesses to stop operating
in-person services by March 26 and urged residents to stay "healthy at
home." In a news conference on March 27, he clarified that the state's
campaign amounted to telling residents to stay home. "That doesn't mean
you need to cower down in your home," he said. But "you stay at home,
unless you are getting groceries or other supplies that you may need."

Residents in the Nashville and Memphis areas were already under
instructions to stay at home as much as possible when Gov. Bill Lee
issued statewide guidelines urging everyone to do so. "We need you to do
that to protect the lives of your neighbors," he said.

### Texas <span class="l-population">About 29 million people</span>

For weeks, Gov. Greg Abbott left it to local officials to impose the
most restrictive orders. Millions of people in certain cities and
counties were told to stay home, including in Harris County, which
includes Houston; Dallas and Tarrant Counties in the Dallas-Fort Worth
region; and Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. On March 31, Mr.
Abbott tightened guidelines, but said that "this is not a stay-at-home
strategy." The next day, he released a video message to Texans, saying
he had ordered "all Texans to stay at home, except to provide essential
services or do essential things like going to the grocery store.” A
spokesman for Mr. Abbott later confirmed that Texas was under a
statewide stay-at-home mandate.

Gov. Ralph Northam, who shut down schools and nonessential businesses
and banned gatherings of more than 10 people, had said that issuing a
stay-at-home order was a matter of semantics. But after seeing beaches
and other public areas packed with people, he issued a formal order. "It
is clear more people still need to hear this basic message: Stay home."

West Virginia was the last state to have a confirmed case of the virus,
but Gov. Jim Justice quickly joined a chorus of other governors calling
on residents to stay inside. “A stay-at-home order is not martial law,”
he said, reminding residents that they could still leave their homes for
food and outdoor activity. But he warned: “The magnitude of this is
unbelievable.”

dogs — it’s good exercise and it’s good for everyone’s mental health —
but please don’t take any other unnecessary trips," he said. "Limit your
travel to essential needs like going to the doctor, grabbing groceries
or getting medication.”
