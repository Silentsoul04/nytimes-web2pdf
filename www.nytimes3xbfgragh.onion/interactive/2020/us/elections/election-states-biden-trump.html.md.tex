In this interactive diagram, try building your own coalition of states,
which are organized according to Cook Political Report ratings, to see
potential outcomes of the presidential race.

The 2020 presidential race will be decided by voters in more than a
dozen competitive states, where Joe Biden and Donald Trump will focus
their efforts to win the 270 electoral votes needed to reach the White
House. In the interactive diagram below, try building your own coalition
of states, which are organized according to Cook Political Report
ratings, to see potential outcomes.

The bottom line in all possible scenarios: Mr. Trump will need to win
some of the states that are currently leaning toward Mr. Biden to reach
270 electoral votes. But he can afford to lose some of the states that
he won in 2016 and still win a second term. Here's a look at the latest
ratings for each state, the electoral votes in each, and the vote
margins from the 2016 election.
