\subsection{Who is Michael Bloomberg?}\label{who-is-michael-bloomberg}}

78 years old

Raised in Medford, Mass.; lives in New York City

Former three-term mayor of New York City (2002-2013)

Billionaire businessman and philanthropist; founded Bloomberg L.P., a
financial news and data company

\hypertarget{bloombergs-signature-issues}{%
\subsection{Bloomberg's signature
issues}\label{bloombergs-signature-issues}}

Mr. Bloomberg has staked his campaign on both his accomplishments as
mayor --- economic growth in the city, falling crime, a focus on public
health --- and his advocacy work during and after his time in office. He
has been an especially prolific giver to gun-control and environmental
causes. But several elements of Mr. Bloomberg's record in government,
like his longstanding (and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/17/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-speech.html}{recently
disavowed}) defense of aggressive stop-and-frisk policing, are likely to
complicate his message to a Democratic electorate.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{1. Has Michael Bloomberg always
been a
Democrat?}}{1. Has Michael Bloomberg always been a Democrat?}}\label{1-has-michael-bloomberg-always-been-a-democrat}}

No. But he was a Democrat before he was a Republican, which was before
he was an independent --- and way before his recent re-embrace of the
party. Despite his socially liberal views, Mr. Bloomberg changed parties
to run in the Republican mayoral primary in 2001. He
\href{https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2007/06/19/bloomberg-leaving-republican-party/}{registered
as an independent} midway through his time at City Hall. In 2016, he
spoke in support of Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National
Convention. In 2018, he
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/10/10/nyregion/michael-bloomberg-democrat-president.html}{officially
returned} to the party.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{2. Did he really ban Big
Gulps?}}{2. Did he really ban Big Gulps?}}\label{2-did-he-really-ban-big-gulps}}

He did not. But he tried. Sort of. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg hoped to
impose limits on the sale of large sugary drinks, but the initiative
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/06/27/nyregion/city-loses-final-appeal-on-limiting-sales-of-large-sodas.html}{failed}
in the courts. Even if it hadn't, Mr. Bloomberg's plan included
exemptions for convenience stores like 7-Eleven, with its outsize Big
Gulp. This has not stopped critics from invoking the Big Gulp as a
symbol of what they view as Bloombergian policy overreach.

\hypertarget{3-does-he-have-a-chance}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{3. Does he have a
chance?}}{3. Does he have a chance?}}\label{3-does-he-have-a-chance}}

Mr. Bloomberg's path is unconventional in the extreme: skipping the
early-voting states and debates to focus on delegate-rich contests in
March and beyond. He has the resources to pull it off --- millions upon
millions of dollars of his own money to flood the airwaves with his ads.
But if another candidate claims momentum in February, Mr. Bloomberg
could have a difficult time breaking through.

His decision to run has proved

complicated} for the media empire he owns.
