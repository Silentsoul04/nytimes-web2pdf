	When the coronavirus pandemic began, we were figuring out how to stay safe, how to stay home and how this was going to affect our lives in the long run. Now that we have better answers to many of these questions, new ones have surfaced. How can I stay healthy while interacting with others? How can I prevent the spread of this disease? What can I do if I’ve lost a job? How can I explain this to my kids? Simply, how can I live in this new normal?

        <p>The race to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus is, perhaps, one of the most important efforts in the contemporary history of science and medicine. In some labs across the world, there is now a cautious optimism that there will be a vaccine for the coronavirus sometime next year. </p>
<p>As of July 28, there were 25 vaccines under clinical evaluation, and 139 others in early evaluation stages, according to <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines">a list</a> released by the World Health Organization. Scientists are working overtime and <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/20/science/coronavirus-vaccine-development.html">trying many different methods</a> to prevent the disease. </p>
<p>An experimental <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">coronavirus vaccine</a> made by the biotech company Moderna provoked a <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/health/cornavirus-vaccine-moderna.html">promising immune response</a> against the virus and appeared safe in the first 45 people who received it, researchers reported in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/coronavirus?query=RP">The New England Journal of Medicine</a> in mid-July.</p>
<p>Governments and major pharmaceutical companies are also wading in. The United States government, as part of a project it’s calling <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-trump-moderna.html">“Operation Warp Speed,”</a> is on a quest to have a vaccine by the end of the year. </p>
<p>Still, there is little consensus in the scientific community whether such accelerated timelines — the end of this year, the start of next — are feasible. Even after a vaccine is researched and tested, manufacturing vaccines is complex. The process typically requires large, sterilized vats and the mobilization of hundreds of pharmaceutical factories. The record for <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/06/09/magazine/covid-vaccine.html">developing a vaccine is four years for the mumps vaccine,</a> and a decade is not an unusual timeline. </p>
<p>But, optimists point out, there has also never been a time when so many experts in so many countries <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/world/europe/coronavirus-science-research-cooperation.html">focused simultaneously on a single topic</a> and with such urgency. That, alone, gives some researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/health/coronavirus-vaccines.html">hope.</a></p>

        <p>Great question! We’re glad you asked.</p>
<p>There’s a full section on helping others further down this list, with specific suggestions for donating blood, helping neighbors and reallocating resources. </p>
<p>But the most helpful thing that you, an individual, can do is wear a mask and maintain six feet of physical distance from other people. We know it’s a pain, and we know a mask can be sweaty and uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Frankly, though, it’s the simplest thing you can do to help. And no one is really exempt. Researchers believe that <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/27/world/europe/coronavirus-spread-asymptomatic.html">symptomless transmission</a> is a factor in the spread of the virus. You might feel fine, but you could be infecting people around you. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-face-masks-surveys.html">Not yet convinced</a>? We’ll keep going. A mask is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html">proven to be effective</a> in slowing the virus’s spread. That also makes it a way to kickstart the sagging economy again; a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/06/30/a-national-mask-mandate-could-save-the-us-economy-1-trillion-goldman-sachs-says/#1083f1e56f18">Goldman Sachs analysis</a> found that if all Americans were required to wear masks in public — as people are in dozens of other countries — it could save the U.S. economy $1 trillion. That’s trillion, with a T. </p>
<p>A minor discomfort and inconvenience could save someone’s life. In fact, it could save quite a few lives. </p>
<p>Our colleagues <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/opinion/coronavirus-masks.html">Jesse Wegman</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article">Nicholas Kristof</a> in the Opinion section offered their arguments for mask wearing.</p>

        <p>As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. </p>
<p>There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.</p>
<p>People infected with the coronavirus typically <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9">produce immune molecules</a> called antibodies, which are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html">protective proteins made in response to an infection.</a> These antibodies may last in the body <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0965-6">only two to three months,</a> which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University.</p>
<p>It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it’s highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.</p>

        <p>Here’s the short answer: Everything is moving quickly. The only things we can say with confidence are that nothing is certain, and that many more Americans are likely to die before this is over. </p>
<p>There are a few big questions to follow. </p>
<p>First, will the virus return in full force with the cold weather? There has been some speculation as to whether <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/warm-weather-coronavirus.html">warm weather</a> has had an effect on slowing the virus. So far, we do know that you are safer outside, provided you wear a mask and stay far apart from other people. When winter comes, it will be harder to spend time outside, especially if you are in a cold climate. If you do need to move inside, only spend time in places with <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html">good ventilation</a>, as the virus seems to <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/04/health/239-experts-with-one-big-claim-the-coronavirus-is-airborne.html">hang in the air</a> for hours. But be prepared in case of another spike in cases where you live.</p>
<p>Second, what’s the deal with schools? We have a section on this below, but expect significant disruption. Some elementary through high school students will be in classrooms <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html">part-time</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html">not at all.</a> Others might be going back to school like normal, but they could be in greater danger of sudden outbreaks and shutdowns. </p>
<p>Some colleges, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/us/cal-state-online-classes.html">including California State University</a>, have announced that they will reopen in the fall, but with most classes moved online. Others are trying to limit the term length. Some professors are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/coronavirus-college-professors.html">rebelling against in-person teaching</a>. Everything is basically on a “pencil it in, pending an outbreak” basis. </p>
<p>And third, what about work? Some non-essential workers are already back in offices and others will soon be returning to plexiglass dividers and alternating schedules, even though cases continue to rise. For many companies, however, the return-to-office date keeps getting pushed out later and later. We have more information about this below, but <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html">as an employee</a>, you have <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html">some rights</a>. That choice might be made for you, though.</p>

        <p>If you were to share saliva with someone — kiss, drink from the same cup — you could obviously get the disease. But it’s not just direct contact that can cause transmission. After pressure from researchers, the W.H.O. conceded that the virus can be transmitted through <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/health/virus-aerosols-who.html">particles that can linger in the air</a> for hours after an infected person has left. </p>
<p>The nastiest recent revelation is, perhaps, that <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/health/coronavirus-toilets-flushing.html">flushing a toilet</a> can also spread the virus throughout a bathroom.</p>
<p>There is some good news, though. After months of sanitizing our groceries, packages and mail, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/health/cdc-coronavirus-touching-surfaces.html">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said</a> that the risk of catching the coronavirus from a surface is low.</p>

        <p>In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness — many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome — which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet — and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe.</p>
<p>By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don’t show many symptoms at all.) In April, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-symptoms-cdc.html">the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs</a> sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed.</p>
<p>Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one’s <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-symptoms-smell-taste.html">sense of smell and taste.</a> Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe” — but few other serious symptoms.</p>
<p>More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>It’s a moving target, and depends a lot on where you live and when. If you’re somewhere with an outbreak, you’re at higher risk. If your state is reopening and cases are climbing, your risk is highest. </p>
<p>Lots of factors determine how sick you actually get. Younger people tend to do better than older people, and having underlying conditions increases your risk. And if you were <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/health/coronavirus-transmission-dose.html">exposed to a lot of the virus</a> — <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/magazine/surgeon-covid-diary.html">as many essential workers were</a> — you have a higher risk of getting a severe case. </p>
<p>Black and Latino people have been <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html">disproportionately affected</a> by the coronavirus in a widespread manner that spans the country, throughout hundreds of counties in urban, suburban and rural areas, and across all age groups.</p>
<p>However, a better question might be what your chances are of getting someone else sick. People in their 20s, 30s and 40s account for a growing proportion of the cases in many places, raising fears that <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/coronavirus-cases-young-people.html">asymptomatic young people</a> are helping to fuel the virus’s spread. </p>
<p>Most people have a low chance of getting a severe case. But if you’re not careful, you have a very high chance of infecting someone who is vulnerable. It’s sort of like drunken driving. You could harm yourself, but you could also harm other people, too. That’s why we don't do it.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that if you’re sick or think you’re sick, but only mildly ill, you should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html">isolate yourself</a>, and you shouldn’t leave your house except to go to the doctor.</p>

<p>One thing is consistent <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-testing.html">across the country</a>, though: Testing is a mess. </p>
<p>As of July 28, the number of daily coronavirus tests being conducted in the United States is only 38 percent of the level considered necessary to mitigate the spread of the virus.

<p>If you want to get tested, prepare for a <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/nyregion/coronavirus-testing.html">sore nose</a> and a long wait time.</p>

        <p>Going to the hospital should not be your first interaction with a doctor. </p>
<p>If you’re feeling sick, speak with a medical professional over the phone and get a test. If you can, consult with a doctor before you go to a medical center or the hospital — they might have insights or suggestions. </p>
<p>As soon as symptoms start, mark the days. While most patients recover in about a week, a significant minority of patients enter “a very nasty second wave” of illness, said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta. “After the initial symptoms, things plateau and maybe even improve a little bit, and then there is a secondary worsening.”</p>

        <p>If you or a loved one is pregnant right now, congratulations! This crazy world could use every bit of new joy it can get. We hope you’re having an easy ride. </p>

<p>Pregnant people might be at increased risk from severe illness from Covid-19, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html">according to the C.D.C.</a> Pregnant people might also be at risk of interruptions to their pregnancies, such as <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/12/nyregion/coronavirus-births-mothers.html">a preterm birth.</a> And a study of pregnant Black and Latino people in Philadelphia shows they have <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/health/coronavirus-race-pregnancy.html">an increased chance of being exposed to coronavirus,</a> which bolsters other research showing that the coronavirus <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/05/us/coronavirus-latinos-african-americans-cdc-data.html">disproportionately affects Black and Latino people.</a> </p>
<p>Experts are cautiously optimistic that the coronavirus <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/why-pregnant-women-face-special-risks-covid-19">won’t alter fetal development,</a> although one study <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/health/coronavirus-pregnancy-covid-19.html">found strong evidence that a baby was infected with the virus in the womb.</a> A more common concern is that the parent carrying the child is <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/nyregion/childbirth-Covid-Black-mothers.html">at increased risk of suffering complications</a> if infected. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/24/health/coronavirus-pregnancy.html>Pregnancy is already a stressor</a> on the lungs and cardiovascular system, and the immune system changes significantly during the course of carrying a baby.  </p>
<p>So. Just as raising a child takes a village, though, it will be a community effort to keep this new baby safe before it’s born. As a family, take extra precautions to protect the pregnancy. Keep your mask on. Socially distance whenever possible.</p>
<p>Importantly, though, keep your appointments. Talk to your doctor about how to safely come in for vaccines and check-ups, or whether remote visits are an option. That’s more important now than ever. </p>

        <p>The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. Six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet.</p>
<p>But some scientists have looked at studies of air flow and are concerned about smaller particles called aerosols. They suggest that people consider a number of factors, including their own vulnerability and whether they are outdoors or in an enclosed room, when deciding whether six feet is enough distance.</p>
<p>Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852">according to a recent study</a>.</p>
<p>It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.</p>

        <p>Probably not. If you are practicing social distancing and making only occasional trips to the grocery store or pharmacy, experts say that it’s not necessary to change clothes or take a shower when you return home. You should, however, always wash your hands upon entering your home.</p>
<p>The same advice goes for <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/smarter-living/maybe-consider-shaving-that-pandemic-beard.html">head and facial hair</a>: If you practice social distancing and wash your hands frequently, you probably don’t need to worry.</p>

        <p>There is no evidence that sunlight can cure coronavirus on the human body. Same for disinfectant and bleach. So, do not drink bleach. Do not inject disinfectant. And do not believe there is some cure for coronavirus coming from ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>Some forms of ultraviolet light have <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-masks-reuse.html">killed the virus on surfaces</a>, and some businesses are using the <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/science/ultraviolet-light-coronavirus.html">purple glow as a disinfectant</a> for surfaces, to good effect.

        <p>There has been a lot of talk about hydroxychloroquine, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html">a drug used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases</a> like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, but a National Institutes of Health panel has specifically advised against using the combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin outside of clinical trials.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2">study of the records of 368 patients in the Veterans Affairs system</a>, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, found that hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, did not help patients avoid the need for ventilators. And hydroxychloroquine alone was associated with an increased risk of death.</p>
<p>The study was not a controlled trial, and patients who received the drugs were sicker to begin with. The authors wrote: “These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.”</p>

        <p>First off, we hope you get better soon. </p>
<p>Recovery is sort of a case-by-case basis. Some people show none or few symptoms, and only find out they have been infected when they test positive for antibodies. Other people are left with <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/10/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-recovery.html">continuing shortness of breath, muscle weakness, flashbacks, mental fogginess and other symptoms months after they first got sick</a>. And there’s <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/04/us/coronavirus-recovery.html">a range of experiences</a> in between.</p>
<p>Mara Gay, a member of The Times’s editorial board, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/14/opinion/coronavirus-young-people.html">wrote candidly</a> about her experience in recovery.</p>
<p>“I am one of the lucky ones. I never needed a ventilator. I survived. But 27 days later, I still have lingering pneumonia. I use two inhalers, twice a day. I can’t walk more than a few blocks without stopping,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Many people recover, but it may take a while. Go easy on yourself, and be forgiving if your body isn’t performing the way it used to. You survived a pandemic. That alone is cause for celebration.</p>

<p>The American Red Cross is collecting donations at blood banks, which have enacted new safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

<p>And even if you’re under a stay-at-home order, donating blood is an essential need, so public health officials have made an exception for your trip to the center.</p>
<p>To find a donation center, check the American Association of Blood Banks <a href="http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx">locator,</a> visit the Red Cross <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/">website</a> or call 1-800-RED-CROSS.</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>Plasma is, basically, the liquid part of your blood: it’s light yellow and about 92 percent water. Any antibodies that your body creates are contained in the plasma. Once you’ve recovered, or convalesced, from a given virus, those antibodies stick around in your plasma for a certain amount of time, ready to fight that virus if it comes back.</p>
<p>If you have antibodies, your convalescent plasma can be transfused into a patient still battling the disease. </p>
<p>To qualify, donors must pass normal blood-donation requirements and be symptom-free of Covid-19 for at least 14 days, and, in most cases, must have positive results from a test. (Other restrictions may apply, depending on the organization.)</p>
<p>Many health care institutions nationwide are involved in plasma donations, including the Red Cross, so to find a location near you go to the website for the <a href="https://ccpp19.org/">National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project</a> or visit the <a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/plasma-donations-from-recovered-covid-19-patients.html">Red Cross’s website</a>.</p>

        <p>This is a hard question to answer. Different phases of reopening target different businesses — retail stores, restaurants and bars, salons and barber shops, houses of worship, gyms, etc. </p>
<p>The increasing moves to lift restrictions — or at least to open up outdoor spaces like beaches and state parks — reflect the immense political and societal pressures weighing on the nation’s governors, even as epidemiologists remain cautious and warn of a second wave of cases.</p>
<p>In general, think of businesses in terms of temptation. Where are people going to feel most at ease, and where will they most want to get close to one another and remove their masks? At a store, you can sort of get in and get out. </p>
<p>But at businesses that exist for socialization, it’s a lot harder. Bars can be loud, and alcohol is flowing. Gyms are inherently germy, and working out in a mask is hard. Outdoor dining in restaurants seems feasible, but can be tricky: Tables are close, you’re eating so you cannot keep your mask on, and waiters keep dropping by to check up on you. </p>
<p>Consider your comfort level with visiting a particular business before you head out. There may be ways to ease your anxieties, such as calling in advance to ask about crowds or cleaning procedures.</p>

        <p>This is a hard question, especially because a stagnant economy also damages the lives and livelihoods of unemployed people. No one wants another recession, and spending money at <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/business/small-business-reopening-coronavirus.html">local businesses</a> is a good way to re-grease the wheels.

You can find your way back into a new kind of normal if you approach reopening thoughtfully and apply ethical guidelines to your behavior.</p>
<p>Before you plan an errand, ask yourself <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/05/06/opinion/coronavirus-us-reopen.html">a few questions</a>. </p>
<p>1. Is this necessary? If you’re going to a store for food or supplies, the answer is yes. But if you are dealing with your emotional health and the health of your relationships by seeing the people you love, that answer might also be yes. </p>
<p>2. Is this necessary now? Again, this might also be a yes. But separate needs from wants. You might want a haircut. Do you need one? You want to go sit in a restaurant. Must you? </p>
<p>3. Can I do this thing in a safer way? This requires some creative thinking, but the answer is also, probably, yes. You might be missing your religious community, and your house of worship is back open. Is there a way to move the service outside, instead of sitting in the crowded room? You’re desperate to see your friends. And you should — mental health matters. But can you see them in their backyard, instead of their living room?</p>

        <p>You could, if only for the story, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/reviews/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/">do it yourself</a>. A <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/style/self-care/buzz-cut-your-own-hair.html">buzz cut</a> is … possible, although perhaps ill-advised. And the <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/smarter-living/maybe-consider-shaving-that-pandemic-beard.html">beard</a>? Chances are that it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/at-home/coronavirus-beards.html">not nearly as cute as you think it is</a>.</p>
<p>But fixing a ’do is one of the most beloved types of self-care there is. Even when you’re visible only on Zoom, split ends and straggly edges can crimp your confidence. When barbershops reopened in New York City, people came <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/nyregion/nyc-barber-shops-coronavirus.html">rushing back</a>.</p>
<p>If you go to <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/fashion/haircut-salon-reopening.html">a salon</a>, make sure you and your hairdresser or barber are both wearing masks. They have to get close to you, so <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/style/coronavirus-haircuts-barbers.html">be extra careful</a>. Also, unless you’re getting your hair done outside, make sure they have fans running and windows open, to keep air moving through the space.</p>
<p>To keep yourself safe, shampoo your hair at home, so your stylist doesn’t have to bend down over you. Wait for the appointment outside and keep the haircut time short. Skip the blowdry. </p>
<p>That’s true for getting your hair colored, too. Step outside while the chemicals are taking, and wash your own hair out.</p>
<p>And, ah, masks. But what about the hair behind my ears? That’s an easy fix. Either settle for a not-so-close shave this time, or unloop one ear at a time, holding your mask to your face. Safety first. Vanity second.</p>

        <p>Taking care of your pearly whites is not just a good beauty habit; it’s also essential for your health. With all the baking and drinking we’ve been doing during lockdown, you’re going to need a visit sooner rather than later. In fact, that’s part of the reason economists are using dentists as a <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/upshot/dentists-coronavirus-economic-indicator.html">bellwether for comfort about reopening writ large</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/08/well/live/dental-care-dentistry-teeth-coronavirus.html">Dentists have mobilized</a> and are ready to accommodate visitors. (Telehealth, for obvious reasons, isn’t an option for most dental cases.) Dentists and hygienists should wear head-to-toe personal protective equipment and change between appointments.</p>
<p>Getting the first appointment of the day may also limit risk, though many dentists said they are seeing fewer patients so they have more time to disinfect rooms between visits. But the risk might be more to the providers than it is to the patients; they keep their mask on while you take yours off. </p>
<p>Before you go, speak with your dentist about how crucial your check-up is right now. If cases are rising where you live, maybe check back in next month if your dental issue can wait.</p>

        <p>In confined spaces, droplets spread. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html">C.D.C. suggests that</a>, while doing the laundry of a sick person, you should wear gloves and try not to shake the clothing, to minimize the possibility of dispersing the virus through the air. If possible, wash items using the warmest water setting, and dry thoroughly. But you can wash their laundry with everyone else’s. </p>
<p>That being said, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/22/health/cdc-coronavirus-touching-surfaces.html">the C.D.C. also says</a> that surfaces contaminated with droplets of the virus can infect people, it is “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” We know that’s contradictory information. Safe is always better than sorry, though, and if you’re living with someone sick, it’s always good to take precautions. </p>
<p>At the laundromat, if you leave your home to wash your clothes, don’t hang out in the room between cycles. Sit in your car or lounge outside as you wait, just for social distancing purposes.</p>

        <p>By their very nature, athletic facilities like gyms tend to be germy, and gym equipment can be difficult to sanitize. In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31660785/">a study published earlier this year</a>, researchers found drug-resistant bacteria, flu virus and other pathogens on about 25 percent of the surfaces they tested in four different athletic training facilities.</p>
<p>If your gym is open and you plan to go, disinfect any surfaces that you touch. Wash your hands frequently, or use hand sanitizer. When spraying a disinfectant, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/well/live/coronavirus-cleaning-cleaners-disinfectants-home.html">give it a fews minutes to kill germs</a> before wiping. Clean any grime or dust off surfaces first. Once you're done with that machine, disinfect it again for the next person.</p>
<p>But, it’s summer. Maybe just exercise outside instead? Or, there are many exercise classes streaming online. Set up a corner of your home, lay out a yoga mat, and stream those instead.</p>

        <p>A superspreader is someone who is really good at passing on the coronavirus to others. </p>
<p>The good news is: they’re rare. </p>
<p>But superspreaders exist. There was that <a href="https://apnews.com/d9a6ca7eef083315648003509d07515a">Texas birthday party</a>, where one man reportedly infected 17 members of his family.

And there was that <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/us/coronavirus-westport-connecticut-party-zero.html">Connecticut soirée</a>, dubbed “Party Zero.” </p>
<p>Now researchers are trying to figure out why so few people spread the virus to so many. For the most part, they’re trying to answer three questions: Who are the superspreaders? When does superspreading take place? And where? </p>
<p>The answer to these questions is, for the most part, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/30/science/how-coronavirus-spreads.html">unknown</a>. As with everything coronavirus-related, assume the worst and be hypervigilant.</p>

<p>Again, the answers to these questions may very well be: yes. An elderly relative has a big birthday. You are getting married (more on this later). </p>
<p>So. Invite a few people that you trust. Will they keep their masks on? And, if they forget, will they be open to gentle reminders? </p>
<p>As for food and activities, keep it outside. Suggest that everyone bring their own blanket, food and utensils. A “bring your own dinner” is better than communal food, but if you go up one at a time to serve yourselves, you should be OK.

        <p>Ugh, same. Hugs are great. We actually <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17201784/">need physical touch.</a> So, is there any safe way to do it? </p>
<p>Tara Parker-Pope, founding editor of Well, posed this conundrum to <a href="https://twitter.com/linseymarr">Linsey Marr,</a> an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech and one of the world’s leading experts on airborne disease transmission. Dr. Marr calculated that the risk of transmission is surprisingly low if both people are wearing a mask -- in part because the duration is so brief.</p>
<p>“If you don’t talk or cough while hugging, the risk should be very low,” Dr. Marr told her.</p>
<p>A few tips for lowering the risk further: Wear a mask. Do it outside. Turn your heads away from one another (no cheek-to-cheek, dear). Don’t linger: you don’t want to breathe into each other’s faces. Wash your hands afterward.</p>
<p>Of course, if you’re really worried about it, you can make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wnBhRne_RE">“hug glove”</a> with a clear tarp with sleeves. It’s like an umbrella for your entire body.</p>

        <p>If you are eating differently, you might be able to manage the change on your own. If you are snacking a lot, that’s OK. But if it bothers you, try to assess whether you are actually hungry and, if so, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/20/well/eat/coronavirus-diet-metabolic-health.html">try to add fruits and vegetables into your routine</a>, if you can.</p>

        <p>Drinking is a hard one. If you imbibe, it makes a lot of sense that you are drinking more now. The coronavirus can be both stressful and boring, and drinking can dull the stress of waiting. New Yorkers, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-liquor-stores-nyc.html">flocked to buy cheap wine</a>. </p>
<p>And although you might have normally had wine with friends, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/16/dining/drinks/drinking-alone.html">drinking alone</a> — especially if you live alone — is not inherently frightening. </p>
<p>But substance abuse experts say they are worried that the pandemic could also trigger more serious drinking problems and even create new ones for people who have never struggled with dependency before. And <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/02/nyregion/coronavirus-alcoholics-anonymous-online.html">without regular meetings</a>, alcoholics are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/health/coronavirus-alcoholics-drugs-online.html">struggling to stay sober</a> without the help of counselors and group support.</p>
<p>There is no right answer as to when it’s time for you to be worried. Some questions, though, might help you get a clearer sense of the problem. These are drawn from several self-administered quizzes put out by rehabilitation facilities and medical centers, but are mostly common sense gut checks.</p>
<p>First, just try to quantify your drinking. How many days a week do you drink? When you do drink, how many drinks do you have? Is there a time of day that you most want to drink? Can you sleep without a drink? </p>
<p>What about your attitude toward drinking? Do you get angry or irritable when someone tries to take your alcohol away, or suggest you might have a problem? Are you secretive about drinking? </p>
<p>And, primarily, have your drinking patterns changed dramatically since the pandemic started? Have you had major life changes — beyond lockdown — like losing your job or the death of a relative? </p>
<p>If your answer to some, or many of these questions, is yes, it might be time to step back and reconsider. If it continues to escalate, talk with friends, family and doctors about what professional help might look like.</p>

<p>Already, open restaurants have been linked to viral spread. The food itself if not the problem. It’s customers, whose laughter and talking can spew viral droplets throughout the area and all over waiters and staff.</p>
<p>If you want to eat restaurant food, consider getting it as take out. That way you can support a local business, see your friends and avoid having to cook — without as many ethical or safety concerns.</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. </p>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/well/live/coronavirus-spread-bars-transmission.html">bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states</a>. Louisiana health officials have tied <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/us/new-coronavirus-phase.html">at least 100 coronavirus cases</a> to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. <a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/bars-large-venues-close-ada-county-after-surge-coronavirus-prompts-rollback#stream/0">In Idaho</a>, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise.</p>
<p>Governors in <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/us/california-coronavirus-reopening.html">California</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/14/us/coronavirus-united-states.html">Texas and Arizona</a>, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/06/30/colorado-bars-closed-coronavirus/">ordered them to close</a>.</p>
<p>To understand the connection between bars and outbreaks, consider a simple question:  Are you your most vigilant self after a few drinks?</p>

        <p>Baking more? We see you. During the lockdown, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/30/style/bread-baking-coronavirus.html">stress baking skyrocketed</a>. Everyone and their mother was suddenly a bread aficionado. Baking necessities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/03/24/people-are-baking-bread-like-crazy-and-now-were-running-out-of-flour-and-yeast/">like flour and yeast</a> were in short supply and bread makers <a href="https://people.com/food/bread-makers-viral-amazon/">sold out</a> across the internet.</p>
<p>People made <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/dining/focaccia-bread.html">focaccia gardens</a>. They made <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/09/at-home/virus-make-ice-cream-in-a-mason-jar.html">mason jar ice cream</a>. And, yes, they made sourdough. </p>
<p>Basically, sourdough is a type of bread that rises due to natural fermentation. Instead of adding instant commercial yeast to your dough, you add parts of a live bacterial culture that you feed and keep in your fridge. That’s called the “starter.” Once a baker has a starter, she can make endless loaves, provided she has flour and a can-do attitude.</p>
<p>By this point, you probably know someone who has a starter: put a blast out to your followers on social media. If not, that’s an easy fix. You can buy one online, <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe">or make one yourself</a>. Just leave some flour and water out for a few days, and yeast will start to ferment. You’ll know it’s ready when it smells, well, sour.</p>

        <p>Both takeout and delivery are safer than eating in restaurants, because social distancing is possible. And, good news, packaging has a low risk of transmitting the disease. Although the C.D.C. says that surfaces contaminated with droplets of the virus can infect people, the agency notes that it is “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”</p>
<p>Delivery, though, is slightly safer because of contactless delivery, which lets workers leave food at your door, said Ben Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. Since the ordering and payment can be done electronically, customers and workers never need to touch.</p>
<p>If you choose to pick your food up, ask the restaurant staff member to put the food down and walk away before you pick it up. Wear a mask. Stand far apart from other patrons. And whether you choose takeout or delivery, try to pay in advance. You can do it electronically, which will keep both you and the workers safer.</p>

        <p>Lots of people with anxiety are struggling more than usual, and lots of people who haven't been anxious before are dealing with symptoms. With different messages coming from varying levels of the government, people can be left feeling as if there are few reliable answers about what precautions they should take or without a clear sense of whether things are under control.</p>
<p>“Uncertainty drives anxiety,” said Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical psychologist at Boston University and the author of <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250161703">“How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety.</a>” “Anxiety is rooted in not knowing what is going to happen.”</p>
<p>Just because the world is reopening, you don’t have to start living your life as if it’s before the pandemic. Instead of focusing on what frightens you, think of the things that you want to have back in your life  that would enrich and fulfill you. Ease back in with activities that you actually want to do, and view this time as an opportunity, weighing whether you want to continue past relationships and activities.</p>
<p>Feel free, also, to tell people what your boundaries are, or name the awkwardness. You might just ask what the other person feels comfortable with. “Should we elbow bump? Do you want to go first? I guess I’ll take the next elevator, right?”</p>
<p>“A problem shared is a problem halved,” Dr. Hendriksen said. “Naming the uncertainty is helpful because it shatters the illusion that there is a right way to do this.”</p>

        <p>Most experts expect to see rates of depression and other psychological disorders increase in the <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/health/coronavirus-america-future.html">coming months</a>, as the pandemic continues. And yet, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150311160240.htm">a majority of those</a> who seek treatment for depression will improve if they persist.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anyone right now that’s not having depression-like symptoms,” said Luana Marques, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and the president of the <a href="https://adaa.org/">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a>. “It’s hard to keep going when our brains are constantly on fight or flight. It makes people really tired. If you’re having trouble concentrating or getting out of bed, it’s not abnormal. It’s an evolutionary response to a threat.”</p>
<p>Familiarize yourself with depression’s <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/expert-answers/clinical-depression/faq-20057770">physical and mental markers</a>. Or take a <a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/depress/phq-9.pdf">self-diagnostic test</a>. When depression isn’t severe, a self-care routine may be enough.</p>

        <p>Meditating is a great way to take care of your stress. If you’re a novice <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/22/at-home/how-to-start-meditating.html">looking to start</a>, try for just five minutes every day. There’s no right way to do it, but a consistent practice is a good way to build your relaxation muscles. Apps can be helpful: <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/">Wirecutter</a>, a product recommendation site that’s owned by The New York Times, recently named the meditation app <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> (which costs $69.99 a year, after a free two-week trial) as its top choice.</p>
<p>Or, just try to find a comfortable space and breathe through your distress. Breathe from your belly, imagining your breath moving up from the depths of your body. Slow it down, close your eyes, and feel your lungs expanding and deflating.</p>

        <p>Finding a therapist can be difficult, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/07/17/smarter-living/how-to-find-the-right-therapist.html">even under normal circumstances</a>.</p>
<p>First, figure out what your insurance is and how you can pay for it. The logistical structures will make it a lot easier to move forward, and narrow down your choices for you. Of course, that’s not always an option — therapy can be time-intensive and expensive. You may not have insurance. If it is possible for you, though, here’s a quick guide.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/well/mind/prospective-therapist-interview-questions-online-virus.html">determine what type of professional you need</a>. If you’re mostly looking to talk, a psychologist is a safe bet. Keep in mind that they do not prescribe medication. </p>
<p>If you’re suffering from a specific ailment —  panic attacks, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, sociopathy, borderline personality disorder or <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/01/28/health/schizophrenia-cause-synaptic-pruning-brain-psychiatry.html">schizophrenia</a> — see a psychiatrist or a psychologist with considerable experience in that specialty. </p>
<p>Then, set up a few preliminary calls and consultations. The getting-to-know-you session is often free, and you should take it as an opportunity to talk about what you are looking for from therapy, and how they approach their practice. </p>
<p>You might click with someone, the way you would with a friend. And there’s nothing wrong with trying a few initial appointments to learn about your own wants and desires. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/13/well/mind/prospective-therapist-interview-questions-online-virus.html">Remote options are now widely available</a>, so you can still attend sessions while <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/well/mind/teletherapy-mental-health-coronavirus.html">staying distant</a>.</p>

That means sticking to a regular bedtime and wake time. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/24/well/melatonin-sleep-aid-coronavirus.html">Melatonin</a> is also worth considering. </p>
<p>Try to go 90 minutes without any screentime before bed — that means no emails, social media or watching TV. (Read a book, take a nice shower, etc.) You can also take baby steps, beginning with 15 minutes, then working your way up.</p>
<p>Working out, whether that means taking a socially distant walk or doing an at-home routine, can help tire you out and dispel extra nervous energy. Taking a warm shower or bath 90 minutes before lights out may also help prime you for a better night’s sleep. And be sure to nix the coffee, alcohol and any food before bed — these things don’t promote quality rest.</p>

        <p>As the weeks morph into months, the ennui of coronavirus-induced isolation can undermine our enthusiasm for getting anything done.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar, remember: Doing what’s meaningful — acting on what really matters to a person — is the antidote to burnout.</p>
<p>Motivation might best be fostered by dividing large goals into small, specific tasks that are more easily accomplished, but not so simple that they are boring and soon abandoned. Avoid perfectionism — the ultimate goal could become an insurmountable challenge. As each task is completed, reward yourself with virtual brownie points (not chips or cookies!), then go on to the next one.</p>

        <p>That makes sense. If you’re <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/26/style/coronavirus-living-together-callout.html">cohabitating</a>, you could be in a tough spot. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/30/smarter-living/coronavirus-long-distance-relationships.html">If you’re not</a>, you’ve probably had to figure out ways to see each other — or not — that feel safe and nurturing for you and the people around you. </p>
<p>Or as Eric Spiegelman, a podcasting executive based in Los Angeles, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericspiegelman/status/1246488909221003264?lang=en">tweeted in April</a>, “My wife and I play this fun game during quarantine, it’s called ‘Why Are You Doing It That Way?’ and there are no winners.”</p>
<p>No matter who you are or how you are interacting, make sure you take care of yourself first. Then, make a plan. If you are both working from home, when can you take time to care for each other and feel normal and romantic again? What rituals can you implement to separate day from night, roommates from lovers? You might just have to impose boundaries. </p>
<p>If you were both at work before the pandemic, separately, during the day, you probably didn’t talk for 14 waking hours straight. Build in time apart, as if you really were at the office, so seeing each other is a nice break at the end of the day, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/parenting/coronavirus-marriage-relationships.html">rather than a droning grind</a>. </p>
<p>“The traditional marriage vows are ‘for better or for worse,’” said Jean Fitzpatrick, a <a href="https://therapistnyc.com/">relationship therapist</a> based in Manhattan. “This is for worse. And so how do we navigate a time like this? Our relationships will either grow as a result, or they will be harmed.”</p>
<p>But this time together might actually make you closer. So many parts of our lives have changed without our consent, and we may be feeling a kind of grief about it. Some people may not want to complain to their partners about these bad feelings, but if you don’t honestly share these feelings, you two might feel a sense of disconnect. Lean on each other right now. </p>
<p>And, you can still do nice, intentional, romantic things. Get dressed up. Foot rubs. Chocolate. You’ll be OK.</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>You are going to have to work together to weigh each other’s needs. One partner might have parents who are older and at higher risk of complications from the coronavirus; the other might be an extrovert who thrives on being around other people and is, emotionally, at a breaking point.</p>
<p>Remember that you’re on the same team. “It’s not, ‘My needs versus your needs, and let’s negotiate,’ but asking the question and having the posture of: ‘What is best for our relationship?’” said Jennifer Bullock, a <a href="https://www.letsdevelopphilly.com/">psychotherapist based in Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>Several psychologists and counselors recommended presenting a united front when explaining shared decisions to friends and family. Any sort of “I would, but he’s afraid” seeds resentment and can amplify the problem far past the boundaries of your own home.</p>
<p>In any fraught situation, sit down with your partner and listen. Instead of offering rebuttals, try to treat it more like an interview about where he or she is coming from. Ask open-ended questions — which can’t be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” You could try: “How should we approach our safety when I go back to the office?”</p>
<p>But remember, this is a pandemic. If one person is seriously scared about their health or the health of their family, their needs might take priority. Ultimately, your well-being and others’ should take precedence.</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>That’s a tough one. </p>
<p>By nature, pandemic dating is much more serious than any other type of dating. Even if you feel willing to take the risk, you’re basically co-mingling your <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/parenting/coronavirus-pod-family.html">quarantine pods</a> when you make out. That doesn’t mean that you have to marry the person, but it does reframe the pace of everything. </p>
<p>There’s something sort of nice, though, about <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/style/first-date-during-quarantine-coronavirus.html">taking it slow</a>. Start with a socially distanced walk with masks or a <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/18/nyregion/coronavirus-dating-video.html">video chat</a>, maybe. Get to know them. If you are going to be physically intimate, you’ll need to have frank and honest conversations about your limits and your living situations. </p>
<p>Now, though, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/well/live/coronavirus-sex-dating-masks.html">sex is way more complicated</a>. A number of public health agencies have offered <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/world/netherlands-sex-buddies-coronavirus.html">tips for dating and sex during the pandemic</a>, but the New York City health department has recently updated its <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-sex-guidance.pdf">Safer Sex and Covid-19 fact sheet</a> with more-detailed and descriptive advice. The new guidelines still say that “you are your safest sex partner,” and that the “next safest partner” is someone in your household. </p>
<p>Some couples are wearing masks during the deed; others are getting tested before getting intimate. The only sure thing is that this is going to be a bumpy year for single people. </p>
<p>One of the good things about dating during quarantine, though, is that it’s cheaper. Two drinks might be $25. A video chat with your own wine is much less.</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>If you are in danger, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233. </p>
<p>This is a problem that is affecting people <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/06/world/coronavirus-domestic-violence.html">across the world</a>. Since the pandemic started, abusers and their families are often stuck in the same house, and tensions are running high. Doctors and advocates for victims are seeing signs of an increase in violence at home. They are hearing accounts of people lashing out, particularly at women and children.</p>
<p>“No one can leave,” said Kim Foxx, the chief prosecutor in Chicago. “You’re literally mandating that people who probably should not be together in the same space stay.”</p>
<p>Across the country, hotlines are seeing increased traffic, with calls and text messages mounting. But in many places, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/17/nyregion/new-york-city-domestic-violence-coronavirus.html">reports are dropping</a>. That’s not because abuse is falling, officials say. Instead, it’s because people are having a harder time reporting. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-child-abuse.html">Reports of child abuse cases are falling</a>, which is also worrisome.</p>
<p>Be careful when reaching out for help, especially if your partner monitors your phone. Maybe ask a friend to call for you, or use their online chat tool.</p>

        <p>Before you talk to your children, it’s important to <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/parenting/coronavirus-kids-talk.html">understand your own anxiety</a> and keep it in check. If your child is worried about the coronavirus, listen to him or her, rather than respond with comments like, “It’ll be fine.” Dismissive reactions can make children feel like they’re not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Talking about the pandemic and its impact may help avoid the <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-young-people-emotional-toll.html">harmful effects of stress</a>. Help your kids understand that there are things they can do to help others — like staying home whenever possible and wearing a mask when they go out. Kids feel good when they know they are helping solve a problem.</p>
<p>Also, avoid making assumptions. While we may be struggling with schools being closed, kids could be rejoicing in it. We might assume our kids miss their friends, but they may appreciate having more time with us. And some who were dealing with bullying or social challenges at school may be relieved to not have to see other kids.</p>

        <p>Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and their symptoms tend to be mild. But it can be serious, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/well/family/coronavirus-children-covid-19.html">contrary to earlier belief</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/19/parenting/pmis-coronavirus-children.html">very small number of children</a> with the virus have shown <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-symptoms.html">symptoms</a> associated with toxic shock or <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/kawasaki-disease-coronavirus-children.html">Kawasaki disease</a>.

<p>If your child develops severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing, an inability to eat or drink, or a change in behavior, you should contact a doctor.</p>

        <p>Honestly, the first step is to acknowledge this is totally bonkers. The writer Deb Perelman, who created the food blog <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/">Smitten Kitchen</a>, laid it out plainly in her essay: "<a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/business/covid-economy-parents-kids-career-homeschooling.html">In the Covid-19 Economy, You Can Have a Kid or a Job. You Can’t Have Both.</a>” </p>
<p>“Why are we not hearing a primal scream so deafening that no plodding policy can be implemented without addressing the people buried by it?” she asks. </p>
<p>There are a few strategies to try. Most importantly, work with your partner and present a united front. Division will create disorder, which will create chaos, which will drive you all up the wall. </p>
<p>However you can, try to create boundaries. That might be a physical boundary (“This is the adult room”) or a time boundary (“You are not allowed to talk to Daddy until 2 p.m. today”). To do that, you might need to use time more effectively — sleep whenever you can and use noise-canceling technology, if need be. Having a daily schedule also helps.</p>
<p>But most important, be kind to yourself, and to one another. This is not like anything that has ever happened before. That’s OK. If the kids are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/13/parenting/manage-screen-time-coronavirus.html">spending more time on their screens</a>, or if you’re not whipping up super healthy organic meals every night, whatever. You’re getting through it, and you’re loving one another. That’s what counts, right?</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>Older people are more likely to have a severe case of the coronavirus, so visiting grandparents or grandchildren is <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/20/parenting/grandparents-visit-safety-coronavirus.html">risky</a>. </p>
<p>That being said, staying apart indefinitely is not feasible. Grandchildren are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/16/parenting/baby/grandparents-meet-newborn-coronavirus.html">being born</a> and grandchildren are turning 10. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/29/well/family/coronavirus-grandchildren-compromised-immunity-cancer.html">Life is slipping by</a>. So find a way forward. </p>
<p>In the nice weather, you could spend time together outdoors. Don’t forget a mask.</p>
<p>Video chat does work, although you might need to walk your older parents through the twists and turns a few times before it’s second nature. </p>
<p>If you live close, perhaps you conjoin your quarantine pods. Get tested, quarantine while you’re getting results back, and then spend time together normally. That might be necessary: Parents, stressed from working at home, desperately need reliable child care. Some grandparents who have become the primary caregivers are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/12/parenting/coronavirus-grandparents-childcare.html?type=roundup&link=intro">delighted, and exhausted</a>.</p>
<p>That might be your best option. Social distancing is hard to explain to kids, and often harder to explain to grandparents. You want kids to have their grandparents around at high school graduations, first jobs and weddings. If you can’t see each other safely, maybe you should wait until you can.</p>

        <p>Older children can be a little cranky about adapting to life with masks, but younger children are perfectly positioned to learn a new drill.</p>
<p>Most children enjoy the chance to feel morally superior to adults (and adults often make this all too easy); go ahead and encourage a little righteousness. They can be the family monitors, reminding their parents not to forget their face coverings when they leave the house.</p>

        <p>Use their imaginations and tell stories. To explain why social distancing is important, one mother in Los Angeles compared it to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9wqC44nYKC/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=embed_video_watch_again">pulling to the side of the road</a> to let an ambulance pass. </p>
<p>You could also try to make it into a game. (Think hot potato, but people.) You win points if you’re far away.</p>
<p>Debates about using <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/08/rewards-systems-for-kids-are-effective-if-you-use-them-correctly.html">rewards to motivate children</a> are endless, but parents <a href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/concerns-about-giving-kids-rewards-1094886">trade favors for obedience</a> all the time. Even the C.D.C. signs off on rewarding good behavior (say, wearing a mask outside without fussing) with  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parents/essentials/consequences/rewards.html">praise, a board game or an extra book at bedtime</a>. </p>
<p>Don’t threaten them, though. Child psychology experts say that threats hurt <a href="https://keepingyourcoolparenting.com/stop-with-the-threats-7-reasons-threats-dont-work-and-what-to-do-instead/">motivation</a> and undermine parent-child relationships. But you can still <a href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/taking-away-privileges-to-discipline-children-1094759">take away privileges</a> for not following the rules (like wandering too close to strangers without a mask). Just make sure you explain the consequences beforehand and make the punishment fit the infraction, psychologists say.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/18/arts/kids-summer-activities-virus.html">Maybe don’t</a>. Let them amuse themselves.</p>
<p>That’s tough: Research has shown that our heavily scheduled lives have contributed to a significant decrease in the amount of free time kids have, so their independent play skills may not be ready for the moment we are facing.</p>
<p>But it might really be necessary. “Independent play encourages time management, executive function and organizational skills, and emotional and physical awareness and regulation,” said Dana Rosenbloom, a parent and child educator in Manhattan. “All skills that help us be successful individuals as adults.”</p>
<p>You can help them play on their own. Start slow — let younger kids direct play for 20 minutes, 35, then an hour. Keep toys out of rotation, said Avital Schreiber-Levy, a parenting performance coach in New Jersey who has created a <a href="https://www.theparentingjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PlayPandemic-Newer.pdf">play guide</a> for parents on lockdown. “When toys sit out too long, they go stale,” she said. “It’s about making them novel again, either because we take them away or we set them up in a new way.”</p>
<p>Let kids get messy, and keep play in a specific zone where they can wiggle and jump. And, be patient. If your kid is used to socializing and screentime, self-directed play might be tough for them. Letting them work out the kinks on their own will develop strength and resiliency that can last them a lifetime.</p>

<p>If your family or friends live nearby, consider linking up <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/09/parenting/coronavirus-pod-family.html">quar-pods</a>. If you as parents agree to community norms and guidelines, you can probably let your kids play together as if the world were normal. </p>
<p>But if you’re unable to do that, or you want to see someone for a play date, know that there are risks. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/11/parenting/playgrounds-reopen-safety-coronavirus.html">Playgrounds are open</a> in some states, and young children are being asked to stay six feet apart and wear masks, an often unrealistic expectation.</p>
<p>If you’re trying for a play date, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/29/parenting/family-socially-distancing-coronavirus.html">good communication</a> with a parent is essential. </p>
<p>“A start would be, ‘Hi, our kids have been asking about getting together, and as you know, this is a complicated conversation right now,’” said Dr. Dipesh Navsaria, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. A parent could continue, “I wanted to start with an open conversation, see where you are, tell you where I am, and see if it’s possible to send a consistent message to our kids.”</p>
<p>Enlist your kids for help, too. If they feel like it’s a project that they’re doing together, they might find some way to enjoy it. You could make spaces — all of the kids get their own blanket — if you’re playing outside. </p>
<p>But there’s no good answer to this. If you can keep your kids away from other kids, you’re reducing your family’s risk of infection. That might not be possible, but it might also be the only way to do it safely.</p>

        <p>Probably not, although it does make sense to worry.  </p>
<p>Social interactions are an important part of development throughout childhood, and spending time with peers is typically part of that process. But try not to fret too much about what kids are missing right now. Children are resilient and adaptable, and they’re not entirely cut off from other people. </p>
<p>There is much to be gained from interactions with parents, siblings and even pets. Time alone is valuable, too. And connection through technology, like hanging out or playing games through video chats, can fill in some of the blanks. Even without peer interaction for a while, kids can still develop socially and emotionally in ways that will prepare them to pursue real-world friendships when those can resume. </p>
<p>Friendship is like riding a bicycle. You don’t really forget how, even if you have some time away.</p>

        <p>As school districts across the United States consider whether and how to restart in-person classes, their challenge is complicated by a pair of fundamental uncertainties: No nation has tried to send children back to school with the virus raging at levels like America’s, and the scientific research about transmission in classrooms is limited.</p>
<p>“It feels like we’re playing Russian roulette with our kids and our staff,” said Robin Cogan, a nurse at the Yorkship School in Camden, N.J., who serves on the state’s committee on reopening schools.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html">online learning,</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/29/us/coronavirus-child-care-centers.html">makeshift child care</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/economy/coronavirus-working-women.html">stunted workdays</a> to continue.</p>
<p>California’s two largest public school districts — Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13,  that <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html">instruction will be remote-only in the fall,</a> citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August.</p>
<p>For other districts, the solution won’t be an all-or-nothing approach. <a href="https://bioethics.jhu.edu/research-and-outreach/projects/eschool-initiative/school-policy-tracker/">Many systems,</a> including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-schools-reopen-fall.html">hybrid plans</a> that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.</p>
<p>Plan for the worst and, frankly, assume the worst. An outbreak at a school could slow operations to a halt for at least two weeks, and would be enormously disruptive. Many scientists and researchers think school reopenings might just be <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/12/upshot/epidemiologists-decisions-children-school-coronavirus.html">wishful thinking.</a></p>

        <p>That depends on the college or college system, and is still pretty up in the air. College is, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/15/opinion/coronavirus-college-safe.html">by its nature,</a> not a socially distant period of life. Dorm living is close; shared bathrooms are closer. So much you do for fun in college is predicated on touch. </p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626">more than three-quarters of colleges and universities</a> have decided students can return to campus this fall, to attend in-class and remote studies. But many <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/03/us/coronavirus-college-professors.html">professors are concerned</a> about coming in to teach. Their students are at lower risk of getting seriously ill from the virus, and are probably taking many more risks outside the classroom.</p>
<p>“Until there’s a vaccine, I’m not setting foot on campus,” said Dana Ward, 70, an emeritus professor of political studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who teaches a class in anarchist history and thought.</p>
<p>Administrators are trying for creative solutions. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/19/us/coronavirus-college-fall-semester.html">Calendars are changing:</a> Campuses across the country are forgoing fall break to zip through academic work and get students home before Thanksgiving. Or, they’re allowing only <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-universities-colleges-reopening.html">some of their students</a> back to campus. In order to achieve social distancing, many colleges are saying they will allow 40 to 60 percent of their students to return to campus and live in the residence halls at any one time, often divided by class year.</p>
<p>Sports are also a big question mark. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-college-football-hbcus-clemson.html">College football</a> is <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/sports/ncaafootball/coronavirus-college-football-season-canceled.html">teetering</a> and the Ivy League has <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/sports/ncaafootball/ivy-league-fall-sports-football-coronavirus.html">suspended all sports</a> until January.

<p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/aponline/2020/07/06/us/politics/ap-us-virus-outbreak-international-students.html">a directive by the Trump administration</a> that students whose classes were moving entirely online for the fall would be <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/us/student-visas-coronavirus.html">stripped of their visas</a> and required to leave the United States, many were wracked with <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/world/international-students-visa-reaction.html">uncertainty.</a> </p>
<p>On July 14, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/world/coronavirus-update.html">walked back</a> the policy, ending a proposed plan that had thrown the higher education world into turmoil. For now, things seem clear.</p>

        <p>Many colleges are allowing you to do so, but check with your admissions counselor before you make a decision. You might be unpleasantly surprised. </p>
<p>Already, some colleges are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/01/us/coronavirus-college-enrollment.html">bleeding students,</a> as a large number of high school seniors have put off a decision about where to go to college in the fall — or whether to go at all.</p>
<p>If you can take <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/23/well/family/college-students-gap-year-coronavirus.html">a gap year,</a> though, it might not be a terrible idea. </p>
<p>For some families, lost income makes it impossible to consider paying tuition right now. For others, it’s more about a refusal to forgo the yearned-for experiences of university life outside the classroom — giggling through late nights with roommates, exploring new interests through campus clubs, playing or cheering for sports teams — for a pale, Zoom-fueled imitation. They’d rather take a year off and try again in 2021.</p>
<p>If you take a year off without a clear plan, try to set clear goals for yourself and design your own curriculum, even if you are holding down a job to support your family. Read what you want to read, try your hand at a new language and enlist a mentor to help you find your way through this strange time.</p>

        <p>You could skip a year, and no one would be the wiser. You could try for a socially distant park hang with friends who live near you. Or, you could host a party over <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-birthday-party.html">video conferencing,</a> which is really more fun than it sounds. Set a time limit, call on people the way you would if you were leading a meeting and decorate your own place. </p>
<p>You could also ask everyone to bake the same easy mug cake, or something, so it feels like you’re all together. Get creative, and take the long view. Next year, you’ll be a year older. Maybe you can host one birthday party with two times the fun? </p>
<p>This is, of course, harder with kids. Start by talking to them about how this year is going to be different. You might want to try for a split-level birthday: in-person activities at home with the members of your household, and online activities with friends.  </p>
<p>At home, you can build a fort at home together, or try for an ambitious craft project. Try some funky baking project, or give them “magic powers” for the day.</p>
<p>For the virtual party, keep it short and sweet. One hour is probably the maximum amount of time, so make sure you give your guests both a start time and end time. The other parents on the call will appreciate it.</p>
<p>Not sure how to fill time online? You could hire virtual entertainment. There are still music classes and magicians and clowns, and they offer virtual shows. (The website Mommy Poppins has <a href="https://mommypoppins.com/birthday-parties/best-virtual-party-performers-and-kids-birthday-parties-at-home">a good list.</a>)</p>

<p>If someone you love is in hospice or nearing the end, start planning. Death is always logistical. Now, it’s even more so. Call a few funeral homes to ask about pricing and procedure, and check your state laws on the size of the gathering.</p>
<p>If your religion mandates you bury someone within a specific period of time, turn to a religious leader for help. They will have worked with other people in your situation, and should have suggestions about how to cope. </p>
<p>Understand that as much as you would like to honor your loved one in your traditional ways, the changed world has also affected funeral services. Consider the risk of a funeral gathering, and the comfort levels and health concerns of those who would like to attend. You may choose to organize a smaller in-person memorial, schedule a service at a later date or hold a Zoom memorial.</p>

        <p>Always remember the basics, like washing your hands frequently (and reminding members of your household to do the same).</p>
<p>The coronavirus isn’t really transmitted on surfaces. Or, at least, surfaces are a much lower risk than person-to-person transmission. So although disinfecting isn’t a bad idea, you probably don’t need to be quite as vigilant now as we initially thought. </p>
<p>Mostly, keep people who might be infected out of your house. But the safest thing you can do to keep your home safe is to keep yourself safe when you’re outside of your home. That means wearing a mask and socially distancing whenever possible.</p>

<p>* Stand with one arm out in front of you and your palm facing the ground.</p>
<p>* With your other hand, gently pull the fingers of the outstretched arm back. You should feel the stretch in the underside of your wrist.</p>
<p>* Hold for a moment or two, then release.</p>
<p>* Next, keeping your arm straight, use your other hand to push your fingers and palm down and toward your body. Hold a few seconds, then release.</p>
<p>* Repeat with your other arm.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to stretch and strengthen your whole body, too. See The Times’s <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/guides/well/strength-training-plyometrics">9-Minute Strength Workout,</a> which includes exercises you can do in a pinch.</p>

        <p>If you’ve had the coronavirus, expect <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/06/opinion/coronavirus-recovery.html">a long recovery.</a> Even if you were an athlete beforehand, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/20/well/returning-to-exercise-training-recovery-coronavirus.html">you are not going to be back at your peak capacity for a while.</a> The usual return-to-play criteria for sick athletes do not apply, said Dr. James Hull, a sports pulmonologist at Royal Brompton Hospital in London. </p>
<p>“We have seen people have some mild symptoms to start with and seem to improve,” he said, “only to then deteriorate really badly at seven days following their first symptoms.”</p>
<p>Even if you haven’t been symptomatic, most everyone took at least a few weeks off of their normal workout routine in the early part of the lockdown. A lot of people are a lot less toned than they used to be. </p>
<p>If that’s you, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/01/well/move/coronavirus-exercise-lockdown-quarantine-sports-weights-running-injuries.html">start slow.</a> Focus on strength, rather than cardio, because inactivity eats away at muscle mass.</p>
<p>Dawdle through any resumption of weight training, said Brad Schoenfeld, an associate professor of exercise science at Lehman College in New York, who researches resistance exercise. “If you have been doing almost no training,” he said, “plan to start at 50 percent of the volume and intensity of your prior workouts” when you return to the gym.</p>
<p>If you’re running outside, wear a mask, even if it’s uncomfortable. You’re breathing heavily, and you could be spitting out — or sucking in — virus droplets. No one wants that.</p>

        <p>In April, <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/us/dog-coronavirus-positive-test.html">a dog in North Carolina tested positive for the coronavirus,</a> as did <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/health/cats-pets-coronavirus.html">two pet cats in New York</a> and <a href="https://newsroom.wcs.org/News-Releases/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/14084/Update-Bronx-Zoo-Tigers-and-Lions-Recovering-from-COVID-19.aspx">eight tigers at the Bronx Zoo.</a> However, there has been no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the coronavirus, according to <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/inaugural-who-partners-forum/coronavirus-poster-english-srilanka.pdf?sfvrsn=289dedc3_0">the World Health Organization</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fanimals.html">the C.D.C.

<p>Still, if you are sick with the coronavirus, it is best not to pet your family dog. And avoid petting other people’s dogs as well. </p>
<p>But do <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/21/well/coronavirus-pet-care-grooming.html">take care of your animal’s mental health</a> — this is stressful for them, too.

Start leaving for a bit, even to walk, so they get used to the idea that you won’t always be around.  </p>
<p>If you know <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/19/world/europe/coronavirus-spain-pets.html">someone is sick and has pets,</a> check in on them.

<p>Almost a month after the phase 1 reopening of New York City that allowed contractors and their crews back into residential buildings, “we’re redefining what ‘full steam ahead’ means,” said Steve Mark, the chief executive of SMI Construction. “It’s not going to mean what it used to.”</p>
<p>It’s a tough balance as contractors and homeowners try to navigate restrictions, but hammers are banging once more. </p>
<p>Other than pandemic-related changes, renovating a home is a pretty standard process. You budget and design, work with a contractor and/or a designer, and watch as mishaps and mayhem happen around you.</p>

<p>Most sports paused when the pandemic swept through the United States in the spring. Many are back, but are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/sports/coronavirus-sports-comeback-reopening.html">playing to empty stadiums.</a> </p>
<p>The N.B.A., W.N.B.A. and M.L.S. took one strategy of setting up a “bubble” where all players and staff are living and playing in a restricted, campus-like set of hotels and stadiums. These leagues have had limited positive tests since their seasons have restarted. Major League Baseball, on the other hand, went a different route and didn’t put as many restrictions on their players, and <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/sports/baseball/mlb-coronavirus-outbreak.html">seem to be suffering the consequences.</a> </p>
<p>The N.F.L, is still pushing to start it’s season this fall. But it’s unclear if <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/07/sports/football/coronavirus-nfl-restart-season.html">they’ll be able to do so successfully.</a> </p>
<p>As to the future of spectator sports, until there is a widely-used vaccine, esuming in-person spectatorship could be dangerous, both because athletes might unknowingly give the virus to fans, or because <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/23/sports/coronavirus-athletes.html">an unknowing fan could give the virus to … an entire team.</a> </p>

        <p>It feels a lot like 2008, doesn’t it? Peter S. Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says there’s a key difference between that economic turmoil and today’s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak’s spread. </p>

<p>But even the 2008 crisis pales in comparison to the scale of the destruction wrought by the coronavirus.

        <p>Employers have to provide <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html">a safe workplace</a> with policies that protect everyone equally.

        <p>President Trump signed <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/26/us/coronavirus-senate-stimulus-package.html">a bipartisan $2 trillion economic relief plan</a> to offer assistance to tens of millions of American households affected by the <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/us/coronavirus-stimulus-package.html">coronavirus</a> pandemic. Its components include <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/politics/coronavirus-stimulus-dead-people.html">stimulus payments</a> to individuals, expanded unemployment coverage, student loan changes, different retirement account rules and more. Most adults received $1,200, although some received less, according to income. </p>
<p>But as with most coronavirus relief packages, questions remain. Some people received them on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/01/faq-stimulus-debit-card/">debit cards,</a> and the envelopes look <a href="https://twitter.com/zackstanton/status/1263908922899009536">like junk mail.</a> Don’t throw them out.</p>
<p>Think you received a payment by mistake? Say, for <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/us/politics/coronavirus-stimulus-dead-people.html">a deceased relative?</a> Don’t spend the money. The Internal Revenue Service will likely ask for it back come tax time in 2021.</p>
<p>If you haven’t received yours yet, don’t panic. Many people have already received their payments, but many others are still waiting or wondering. There are a lot of reasons you could be among them, even if the government has <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/01/business/coronavirus-stimulus-social-security.html">removed some of the hurdles</a> it initially set up.</p>
<p>Try the I.R.S. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment">Get My Payment</a> tool again. It’s supposed to help people figure out when and how their money might be arriving. The  I.R.S. is updating the information once each day, usually in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Make sure you filed the right paperwork. If you haven’t had to file a return because your gross income did not exceed $12,200 ($24,400 for married couples), you still qualify for a payment. But if you’re not a recipient of S.S.I. or V.A. benefits, you should fill out a special form for non-filers.</p>
<p>Also, be careful of <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/22/technology/stimulus-checks-hackers-coronavirus.html">scammers.</a></p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/us/politics/whats-in-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html">stimulus plan</a> includes a significant expansion of unemployment benefits that would extend jobless insurance by 13 weeks. The program is aimed to help freelancers, part-time workers, furloughed employees and gig workers, such as Uber drivers, as well as full-time employees who have lost their jobs.</p>
<p>States have set their own rules for eligibility and benefits, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces about 45 percent of your lost income. Eligible workers had been getting an extra $600 per week on top of their state benefit, but that expired at the end of July</p>
<p>One important note: You might not have to lose your job to qualify. If you’re quarantined or have been furloughed — and you’re not being paid but expect to return to your job eventually — you may be able to get unemployment benefits.</p>

        <p>Student loans: The Department of Education has granted a payment waiver of at least 60 days to many people. But it’s not necessarily automatic. In general, you have to call your loan servicer to request a waiver and to make sure that your loan is eligible. The waiver does not apply to private student loans. One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it was offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.</p>
<p>With the stimulus package, there will be <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html">automatic payment suspensions</a> for any student loan held by the federal government until Sept. 30. It may be hard to contact many of the loan servicers right now, so check your account online in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Utility bills: Some utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment. A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small-business customers who can’t pay their bills. Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.</p>
<p>Housing: There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has instructed mortgage servicers to allow borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to delay payments. If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on <a href="https://justshelter.org/community-resources/">Justshelter.org.</a> This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress.</p>
<p>Loans and credit: Many consumer lenders are offering affected customers help if they can’t make payments. The American Bankers Association has a list of lenders here, although the help they’re offering varies. Some say they will allow borrowers to skip payments; some are offering other accommodations.</p>

<p>There’s also the possibility of continuing your job-based coverage under a law known as the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA; applying for Medicaid with your state agency; or getting an individual plan at Healthcare.gov. <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/upshot/coronavirus-health-insurance-faq.html">It depends on your circumstances</a> which route makes sense.</p>

        <p>That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But you may want to think about having enough cash <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-money-advice.html">to cover basic needs</a> if you’re retired. One financial planner recommended that retirees set aside enough cash for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.</p>

        <p>A coronavirus emergency relief package, passed by Congress in mid-March, gives qualified workers <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-paid-leave-guide.html">two weeks of paid sick leave</a> if they are ill, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventive care for the coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Many workers at small and midsize companies and nonprofits can get the paid leave, as can government employees, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. The law includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig-economy workers. But it excludes those at companies with more than 500 people, including many front-line employees at many major retailers and fast-food restaurants.</p>
<p>Workers at places with fewer than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department could exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business. Employers can also decline to give leave to workers on the front lines of the crisis: health care providers and emergency responders.</p>

<p>In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own “pod.” “Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,” the C.D.C. says.</p>
<p>If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/21/travel/crowded-flights-coronavirus.html">picking your airline.</a> But know that airlines are taking real steps <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/05/travel/coronavirus-airplane-cleaning.html">to keep planes clean</a> and limit your risk.</p>

        <p>That depends on where you want to go. </p>
<p>In recent weeks, many countries around the world, including the United States, have imposed <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/10/travel/state-travel-restrictions.html">travel restrictions</a> to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Airport closures, the suspension of all incoming and outgoing flights, and nationwide lockdowns are just some of the measures countries are adopting in an effort to help contain the pandemic.</p>
<p>Even as many countries remain off-limits to American visitors because of the high rate of coronavirus within the United States, about two dozen others have started to welcome U.S. citizens. We have <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/travel/american-travelers-restrictions-coronavirus.html">an updated list of the international destinations that allow U.S. citizens to enter,</a> though there are some restrictions.</p>

        <p>That depends. Questions about the morality of traveling are not new. For years, people have raised concerns about <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/13/opinion/letters/travel-climate-change.html">climate change</a> and traveling to countries with <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/05/16/t-magazine/ethical-travel-reporting.html">oppressive governments.</a> Certain travel activities, like <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/06/19/travel/thailand-elephant-tourism-humane.html">elephant riding,</a> also raise eyebrows.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/travel/travel-discounts-vouchers-coronavirus.html">economy of many vacation destinations,</a> like the Caribbean, often depend on tourism. And cheap flights <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/21/travel/budget-travel-coronavirus.html">are tempting.</a> But many countries have been spared outbreaks, and have much weaker health systems than we do. As with everything these days, assess the risks.</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>Many experts and ethicists agree: The only way to enable everyone to vote is to turn to a mail-in ballot system, because <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/05/magazine/voting-by-mail-2020-covid.html">going to the polls could be a matter of life or death.</a></p>
<p>President Trump alleged that voting by mail could lead to voter fraud — despite being used for years in Democratic and Republican states without controversy. But states are <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/21/us/vote-by-mail-trump.html">opening the door</a> to the system, and some opposition to letting <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/10/us/politics/voting-by-mail-georgia.html">voters mail in their ballots</a> has dissipated.</p>
<p>Republican opposition to the system seemed driven by the conviction that an increase in mail voting would benefit Democrats. But <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/25/us/vote-by-mail-coronavirus.html">the reality is far less clear.</a> The pandemic is also <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/14/us/voter-registration-coronavirus-2020-election.html">affecting who can vote</a> — millions of people who would ordinarily register or update their registrations in a presidential election year have not been able to do so. </p>
<p>The drop in registration has the potential to depress participation in a November presidential election that has been widely expected to break all records for turnout.</p>
