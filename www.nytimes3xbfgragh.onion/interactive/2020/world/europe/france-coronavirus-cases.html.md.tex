There have been at least 328,900 confirmed cases of coronavirus in
France, according to the
\href{https://dashboard.covid19.data.gouv.fr/}{French government}. As of
Tuesday afternoon, 30,726 people had died.

National health authorities in France do not provide cumulative regional
data for test-confirmed cases of the virus; only daily snapshots are
reported. They do, however, report regional data for the total number of
people hospitalized for Covid-19 and how many of those people have
recovered or died.

From April to early August, the number of hospitalized patients in
intensive care has been steadily decreasing, dropping below the 400 mark
in late July. Although these numbers have risen again in August, they
remain at a fraction of what they were at the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/17/world/europe/france-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=6}{height
of the crisis}.

Months have passed since government officials began lifting the
nationwide lockdown, but health authorities have reported a slow
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/world/europe/france-coronavirus.html}{resurgence
of the epidemic in August}. Officials have attributed the recent growth
in cases to waning social distancing efforts, especially among younger
people.

As of July 20, the government imposed mandatory mask-wearing in enclosed
public spaces. The requirement was extended in August to include crowded
outdoor areas in more than a third of French cities.

All restrictions on travel within France have been lifted, and schools,
shops,
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/world/europe/coronavirus-paris-cafe-reopen-france.html}{cafés
and restaurants} have all reopened with some restrictions. The French
government has ramped up its ability to identify and isolate new cases
and find the potentially-infected through contact-tracing teams and a
smartphone application.

The New York Times has found that official
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/12/us/covid-deaths-us.html}{tallies
in the United States} and
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html}{in
more than a dozen other countries} have undercounted deaths during the
coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.

France is one of a few countries in Europe that includes Covid-19 deaths
in retirement or nursing homes in its country-wide daily death tallies,
meaning the overall picture of mortality is more accurate. But the data
skewed higher in the early weeks of April when previously unrecorded
deaths were suddenly added to the nationally tally.

Generally speaking, France was late to increase its testing capacities
compared to countries like
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-cases.html}{Germany}.
The national public health authority has acknowledged that the reported
number of test-confirmed cases was lower than the real number of cases.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

The Times has identified the following reporting anomalies or
methodology changes in the data:

France does not regularly report new data on weekends.

Governments often revise data or report a single-day large increase in
cases or deaths from unspecified days without historical revisions,
which can cause an irregular pattern in the daily reported figures. The
Times is excluding these anomalies from seven-day averages when
possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing}. It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/05/well/covid-19-symptoms.html}{Here
is a guide to the symptoms of Covid-19.}

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs,
and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear
masks, the more we all stay safer.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into
contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to
keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed
them.

Here's a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html}{complete
guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
