There have been at least 350,100 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the
United Kingdom, according to
\href{https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/}{Public Health England}. As of
Tuesday morning, 41,554 people had died. The government
\href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53722711}{changed its
methodology} for counting Covid-19 deaths on Aug. 12, lowering the
overall death toll by more than 5,000.

The
\href{https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases}{Office
for National Statistics} also produces a weekly report on the number of
deaths registered in the U.K. that mention Covid-19 on a death
certificate. This figure, which includes deaths outside of hospitals, is
higher than the reported daily death toll.

Britain has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe, surpassing
Italy and Spain in early May.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/11/world/europe/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson.html}{conditional
plan} to ease Britain out of its seven-week lockdown. In a televised
speech, he said those who cannot work from home may return to work, and
that people can freely exercise and spend time outdoors. In July, the
self-isolation period for people who test positive for the coronavirus
or develop symptoms
\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53588709}{increased} from seven days
to 10.

Millions of rapid
\href{https://www.ft.com/content/c381b4e6-89c7-402a-9db3-d85e9d53d7cf}{coronavirus
tests} that can detect the virus within 90 minutes will be issued to
hospitals, care homes and laboratories in the coming months. In England,
councils with high levels of coronavirus infection are establishing
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/04/english-councils-with-highest-covid-rates-launch-own-test-and-trace-systems}{local
contact-tracing plans} to make up for flaws in the government's
``\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/17/world/europe/uk-contact-tracing-coronavirus.html}{world-beating}''
system.

The
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/how-coronavirus-restrictions-will-differ-around-the-uk-england-scotland-wales-northern-ireland}{four
countries of Britain} are easing lockdown restrictions at different
speeds. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers,
\href{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/15/theatres-casinos-and-bowling-alleys-reopen-in-england}{theatres}
and tourist spots can now reopen. And after much debate, the nation made
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/14/world/europe/uk-coronavirus-masks-mandate.html}{facemasks}
mandatory in most stores and certain
\href{https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own\#:~:text=In\%5BNOT\%20FOUND\%20\%20England\%\%5D2C\%5BNOT\%20FOUND\%20\%20you\%\%5D20must\%20wear,and\%5BNOT\%20FOUND\%20\%20coach\%\%5D20stations\%5BNOT\%20FOUND\%20\%20and\%\%5D20terminals)}{public
spaces}. England has also lifted its fourteen-day quarantine period for
incoming travellers from
\href{https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors}{select
countries}.

In Scotland, the country has lifted
its\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53264720}{five-mile travel

Wales has taken a more cautious approach to reopening than its
neighbors: pubs, restaurants and cafes did not reopen to serve customers
indoors until August.
In\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53007269}{}\href{https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53007269}{Northern
Ireland}, up to fifteen people can meet outdoors, and at the beginning
of July, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, and tattoo parlours were
greenlit for operation.

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

The Times has identified the following reporting anomalies or
methodology changes in the data:

July 2: Health authorities changed their methodology to avoid
double-counting positive cases. This change, along with a historical
revision of data, resulted in a decrease of more than 30,000 cases in
the cumulative case total for the U.K.

Starting June 18, data for Scotland will include testing results from
the U.K. Government's Regional Testing Centres, in addition to data from
NHS Laboratories. Scotland did not update data between June 15-17 while
preparing this change.

On Aug. 12, health authorities
\href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53722711}{changed their
methodology} for counting Covid-19 deaths, lowering the overall death
toll in the United Kingdom by more than 5,000. The data on this page has
been revised to reflect the updated methodology. Data for deaths in
England's local areas was also removed and is reported on this page as
of Aug. 12.

Governments often revise data or report a single-day large increase in
cases or deaths from unspecified days without historical revisions,
which can cause an irregular pattern in the daily reported figures. The
Times is excluding these anomalies from seven-day averages when
possible.

Experts'
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/health/coronavirus-profile-covid.html}{understanding
of how the Covid-19 works is growing}. It seems that there are
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html}{four
factors that most likely play a role}: how close you get to an infected
person; how long you are near that person; whether that person expels
viral droplets on or near you; and how much you touch your face
afterwards.
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/05/well/covid-19-symptoms.html}{Here
is a guide to the symptoms of Covid-19.}

You can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by
following some
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/prepare-for-coronavirus.html}{basic
steps}:

Keep your distance from others. Stay at least six feet away from people
outside your household as much as possible.

Wear a mask outside your home. A mask protects others from your germs,
and it protects you from infection as well. The more people who wear
masks, the more we all stay safer.

Wash your hands often. Anytime you come in contact with a surface
outside your home, scrub with soap for at least 20 seconds, rinse and
then dry your hands with a clean towel.

Avoid touching your face. The virus can spread when our hands come into
contact with the virus, and we touch our nose, mouth or eyes. Try to
keep your hands away from your face unless you have just recently washed
them.

Here's a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html}{complete
guide on how you can prepare} for the coronavirus outbreak.
