The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday proposed changes that
**Boeing** must make to the 737 Max, potentially clearing the way for
[the plane to start flying
again](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/15/business/boeing-737-max-return.html)
by the end of the year.

The changes include updating the plane’s flight control software,
revising crew procedures and rerouting internal wiring. Once formally
published, the proposal will be open to public comment for 45 days,
after which the agency will issue a final ruling.

The agency concluded in a related report published on Monday that its
proposal was in line with Boeing’s recommendations. The report said the
company’s recommendations had sufficiently addressed the problems that
contributed to two fatal crashes, resulting in the worldwide grounding
of the jet.

“The F.A.A. has preliminarily determined that Boeing’s proposed changes
to the 737 Max design, flight crew procedures and maintenance procedures
effectively mitigate the airplane-related safety issues that
contributed” to crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346
people, the agency said.

The Max has been grounded since March 2019, [costing Boeing
billions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/29/business/boeing-737-max-costs.html)
of dollars.

Once the F.A.A.’s proposal is official, Boeing can begin to make the
changes and ready the planes for flight, a process that could take more
than a week per jet and involves system checks, deep cleaning and
software updates. The company will have to do that for hundreds of
planes that customers have already received and hundreds more that
Boeing has made but not delivered.

Several other obstacles remain before the F.A.A. lifts its grounding
order on the plane, including the development of pilot training
requirements and the review and filing of additional documentation.

The president of the **Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago** said the
central bank had limited room to do more and that Congress would need to
[support the
economy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/business/fed-official-says-a-hard-lockdown-could-get-virus-under-control.html)
if the United States faced a full-fledged second wave of coronavirus
infections.

“The punchline ought to be that the ball is in Congress’s court,”
Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, said on a call with
reporters.

The Federal Reserve cut its primary interest rate, the federal funds
rate, to
[near-zero](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates.html)
in March. Central banks abroad have cut borrowing costs into negative
territory, but Fed officials have been consistently skeptical that such
policies will be effective.

“We can’t lower the funds rate. Negative interest rates aren’t going to
be the tool that we decide to use at this point, or probably at any
point,” Mr. Evans said.

The Fed might be able to use a policy that would cap certain interest
rates — an approach commonly called “yield curve control” — but Mr.
Evans suggested that slightly higher medium-term rates are not the real
economic problem. The Fed has the ability to offer [emergency loans to
backstop turbulent
markets](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/business/economy/coronavirus-federal-reserve-policy.html),
but businesses and governments might need grants to make it through.

“At the moment, it’s really fiscal policy that needs to be addressing
this,” he said. Even now, more congressional support is needed to shore
up the economy as the pandemic wears on, Mr. Evans said.

The Chicago Fed chief was not alone in arguing that recently lapsed
expanded unemployment benefits should be in some way addressed, as
[Congress
debates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/us/politics/coronavirus-jobless-aid.html)the
future of its pandemic response.

Thomas Barkin, president of the **Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond**,
[warned
that](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-barkin/feds-barkin-says-economy-faces-sinkhole-without-more-fiscal-support-idUSW1N2B8003)the
pandemic might be creating an economic “sinkhole,” rather than the
pothole policymakers initially believed they were facing. Robert S.
Kaplan, president of the **Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas**, said in an
interview on Bloomberg television on Monday that the policies [had
helped](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-03/extension-of-jobless-benefits-to-buoy-growth-fed-s-kaplan-says?srnd=premium&sref=oZtxD6sa)
to bolster consumers, adding that “it’s important that we see an
extension of it.”

For nearly 70 years, the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief
program has helped companies recover from catastrophes including
wildfires, hurricanes and earthquakes. But it has never faced anything
like [the coronavirus
crisis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus).

Besieged by more than eight million applicants — and operating in the
shadow of the hastily assembled [Paycheck Protection
Program](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/26/business/ppp-small-business-loans.html)
— the disaster relief effort has given out more money in the past few
months than it had in its entire history.

But the demand has created a problem that is hobbling hundreds of
thousands of applicants: The agency, afraid of running out of cash,
capped its coronavirus loans at a fraction of what companies can
normally borrow — even though the program has handed out less than half
the $360 billion it can lend.

Caroline Keefer, a clothing designer in Los Angeles, had expected to
qualify for a loan of at least $500,000 based on a complex formula
devised by the agency. But when her loan offer arrived in May, it was
for $150,000 — the ceiling the S.B.A. quietly put in place that month.
Qualified companies can usually take loans of [up to $2
million](https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-newsroom/press-releases-media-advisories/sba-provide-disaster-assistance-loans-small-businesses-impacted-coronavirus-covid-19).

The limit has crimped Ms. Keefer’s efforts to salvage a business that
did $2 million in sales last year. Her company, [River +
Sky](https://www.riverandskycalifornia.com/), sells directly to
merchants like boutiques, department stores and hotel spa shops.

Nearly 400,000 businesses have run into the $150,000 limit, according to
[the agency’s
data](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/economic-injury-disaster-loans#section-header-5).
S.B.A. representatives declined to comment on the cap or why it was
imposed.

Websites publishing coronavirus-related misinformation are being
supported financially by tapping into internet advertising networks
owned by **Google** and **Amazon**, [according to a new Oxford
University
study](https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/covid19-disinfo-seo/).

Google and Amazon operate two of the world’s largest internet
advertising networks and serve as central repositories for millions of
ads that are distributed to websites around the world. But because the
systems are largely automated, they are vulnerable to abuse, said Philip
Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute, who co-wrote the
study.

Social media platforms like **Facebook**, **Twitter** and **YouTube**
have been widely criticized as being the primary tool for sharing
coronavirus-related misinformation. But the researchers said the
advertising networks provide the financial oxygen to websites that are
publishing much of the dubious and misleading information about the
pandemic.

Mr. Howard, who previously assisted the Senate investigation into
Russian disinformation efforts, said Google and Amazon should consider
developing a blacklist that blocks website with a history of sharing
false and misleading information about the pandemic from being able to
use their advertising networks.

He said the pandemic had spawned a niche world of websites that “preys
on people’s insecurities.” Many of the sites sell products promising to
cure or prevent the disease. Even though the sites have a relatively low
audience, they muddy the information ecosystem and undermine the broader
public health response.

“They are hucksters, fraudsters, peddling misinformation,” he said. “It
would be a public service to take them down.”

Amazon and Google did not respond to requests for comment.

## [Tech rally lifts markets, and the Nasdaq reaches a record.](#tech-rally-lifts-markets-and-the-nasdaq-reaches-a-record)

</div>

Stocks rallied on Monday, led higher by large technology companies, as
investors weighed a mixed bag of business news against continuing
concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.

The S\&P 500 rose nearly 1 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite
climbed 1.5 percent and hit a record. Shares in Europe and Asia also
rose.

After the gain on Monday, the S\&P 500 is now less than 3 percent below
its high, which it reached in late February before the rapid spread of
the coronavirus and concern about the economic damage it would cause
sent markets into a tailspin. The index ended July with its fourth
consecutive monthly gain.

A big factor behind the recovery has been the success of big technology
companies like **Amazon** and **Apple**, which have thrived during the
pandemic as demand for their products and services rose with consumers
stuck at home. Last week, several of the largest technology companies
reported blockbuster earnings.

On Monday, it was **Microsoft** that led the big-tech rally. The stock
rose more than 5 percent after President Trump said that [Microsoft
could pursue an
acquisition](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/technology/trump-tiktok-microsoft.html)
of **TikTok** in the United States. The president’s statement came after
a weekend of headlines about the potential takeover of the video sharing
platform, which Mr. Trump has said is a national security threat because
it is owned by a Chinese company.

Speaking at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said that TikTok would
shut down on Sept. 15 unless Microsoft or another company purchased it.

Also lifting market sentiment on Monday, the Institute for Supply
Management said its measure of manufacturing activity in the United
States rose for a second consecutive month in July, and that “sentiment
was generally optimistic” among manufacturers as orders increased.
Similarly, the [IHT Purchasing Managers’
Index](https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/c4e32989182e4296964138d78fcc1305)
for manufacturing in the euro area reflected the first expansion in
activity since early 2019.

Still, [concerns about the spread of the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/world/coronavirus-covid-19.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)
continued through the weekend, with tightening restrictions in Manila
and Melbourne, Australia. In the United States, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the
Trump administration’s coronavirus coordinator, said that the country
was in a “new phase” of the pandemic, and that it was much more
extensive than the spring outbreaks in major cities like New York and
Seattle.

**Lord & Taylor** and the company behind **Men’s Wearhouse** and **Jos.
A. Bank** filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday, the latest American
retailers to fall victim to the coronavirus outbreak.

The department store chain [Lord &
Taylor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/Lord-and-Taylor-Bankruptcy.html)
traces its roots to 1826, and had been floundering for years.
**[Tailored
Brands](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/business/tailored-brands-mens-wearhouse-bankruptcy.html)**[,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/business/tailored-brands-mens-wearhouse-bankruptcy.html)
which once dominated the market for men’s suits through Men’s Wearhouse
and Jos. A. Bank, saw demand plummet for its corporate clothing with the
pandemic keeping America’s office workers at home.

They join a roster of bankruptcy filings since the beginning of May that
includes **[Neiman
Marcus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/business/neiman-marcus-bankruptcy.html)**,
**** **[J.
Crew](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/03/business/j-crew-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html)**,
**[J.C.
Penney](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/15/business/jc-penney-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html)**,
**[Brooks
Brothers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/08/business/brooks-brothers-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html)**
and the owner of **[Ann
Taylor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/ascena-bankruptcy-ann-taylor-lane-bryant.html)**[](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/23/business/ascena-bankruptcy-ann-taylor-lane-bryant.html)and
**Loft**.

Tailored Brands had approximately 1,400 stores and 18,000 employees. It
had already [announced
plans](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200721005319/en/Tailored-Brands-Announces-Plans-Reduce-Headcount-Close)
in July to eliminate 20 percent of its corporate jobs and close up to
500 stores, and on Sunday, the company said that it planned to use the
restructuring process to cut its debt by at least $630 million.

Lord & Taylor was [acquired last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/08/28/business/lord-taylor-sold-le-tote.html)
by the clothing rental start-up **Le Tote** in an unusual $100 million
deal. Now Le Tote and Lord & Taylor are both seeking Chapter 11
protection from their creditors. The companies said in a filing on
Sunday that they operated 38 locations, which had been temporarily
closed since March.

Abby Homer, a representative for Le Tote and Lord & Taylor, declined to
comment on the filing. The filing said that the company had 651
employees, which appears to exclude Lord & Taylor’s thousands of store
workers, and brought in around $250 million in revenue last year.

Just as [the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus)
emptied offices, in many cases it also did away with in-person job
interviews. Acing a job interview conducted over Zoom or Google Hangout
isn’t easy. The good news is that the interview basics still apply —
such as researching the company and thinking ahead on the questions you
might be asked.

The Times’s Julie Weed
[shares](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/03/business/online-job-interview-tips.html)
how to adapt classic interview techniques to the new world of internet
interviews.

Like Hong Kong, **HSBC** has long sat at the crossroads between East and
West, a big global bank based in Britain that has reveled in and
profited from its deep relationship with China. And like Hong Kong, it
is now caught in a new era of confrontation between Beijing and major
Western governments.

In China, HSBC has been accused of “setting traps” to ensnare the
Chinese tech giant, **Huawei**. In Britain, it has been admonished for
seeming to back Huawei’s ambitions in the country.

Straddling neutral ground is no longer an option. [HSBC got called
out](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/31/business/hong-kong-china-business.html)
in China for not publicly backing the new national security law in Hong
Kong. When the bank [eventually expressed
support](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/business/china-hong-kong-damage.html)
on its Chinese social media account, members of the British Parliament
demanded an explanation and urged HSBC to rescind the statement.

Global businesses are increasingly under pressure to pick sides as the
United States and its allies target the political and economic agenda of
China.

“There are multiple tailwinds pushing the global business world toward
this highly geopolitically sensitive environment where the landscape has
shifted fundamentally, and you can no longer be agnostic,” said Jude
Blanchette, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. “It is the logical extension of
this new paradigm where economic security is now considered national
security.”

Overcrowding, not density, has defined many coronavirus hot spots.
Service workers’ quarters skirting Silicon Valley are no exception. The
Times’s Conor Dougherty
[reports](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/01/business/economy/housing-overcrowding-coronavirus.html):

> It was not surprising when three-quarters of the house tested
> positive. There were 12 people in three bedrooms, with a bathroom
> whose door frequently required a knock and a kitchen where dinnertime
> shifts extended from 5 p.m. well into the evening.
> 
> Karla Lorenzo, a Guatemalan immigrant who cleaned houses in San
> Francisco and Silicon Valley, lived in the big room along the
> driveway. Big is a relative term when a room has five people in it.
> She and her partner, Abel, slept in a queen-size bed along the wall.
> There was a crib for the baby at the foot, with the older children’s
> bunk bed next to that. The other housemates had similar layouts.
> 
> Living among many people, as Ms. Lorenzo put it in Spanish, you cannot
> really avoid your housemates. The sounds, the smells, the moods —
> everyone is pressed against all of it, and they understood that if one
> of them got [the
> coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/coronavirus),
> the rest probably would.
> 
> That happened in April, and now the house is returning to health.
> Abel, referred to by his first name because his immigration status is
> uncertain, is home after three weeks in the hospital, where Ms.
> Lorenzo feared he would die alone gasping for air. And she is no
> longer squirreled in the closet where she spent days to avoid giving
> the virus to the children.
> 
> Now comes a second struggle: figuring out how to pay rent.

  - **J.C. Penney**, the cornerstone of American malls, was the latest
    retailer to announce it would not open Thanksgiving Day this year.
    Other major chains, including **Walmart** and **Target**, have said
    they would push the start of holiday shopping back to Black Friday,
    often casting the change as in honor of the work of their front-line
    employees. J.C. Penney, which filed for bankruptcy in May, [said in
    a
    statement](https://companyblog.jcpnewsroom.com/2020/08/03/jcpenney-to-close-stores-on-thanksgiving-day-2020/)
    that the move was intended to allow both associates and customers
    “to stay safe, relax, and enjoy the day.”

  - **HSBC**, Europe’s largest bank, reported a 96 percent drop in
    profit in the second quarter to $192 million, as the bank increased
    provisions for bad loans by $3.8 billion. The bank, which does
    almost half of its business in Asia, also confirmed it would speed
    up a restructuring plan that would cut 35,000 jobs.

  - **Marathon Petroleum**, the largest U.S. independent refiner,
    announced Sunday that it had sold its [Speedway gas station
    chain](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/02/business/marathon-petroleum-speedway-7-11.html)
    to the Japanese retail group that owns **7-Eleven** for $21 billion
    in cash. The sale of Speedway, one of the country’s largest
    convenience store chains with nearly 4,000 outlets, is the biggest
    corporate deal in the oil sector since the coronavirus slashed
    demand for fuel early this year.
