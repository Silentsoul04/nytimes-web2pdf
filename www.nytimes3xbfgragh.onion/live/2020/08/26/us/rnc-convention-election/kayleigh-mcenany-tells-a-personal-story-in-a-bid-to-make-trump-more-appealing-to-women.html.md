Republicans used the third night of their convention on Wednesday to
amplify warnings of violence and lawlessness under Democratic
leadership, trying to capitalize on the worsening unrest in Wisconsin to
reclaim moderate voters who might be reluctant to hand President Trump a
second term.

The party also made appeals to social conservatives with attacks on
abortion and accusations that the Democrats and their nominee, Joseph R.
Biden Jr., were “Catholics in name only.” And they intensified their
effort to **** lift Mr. Trump’s standing among women with testimonials
vouching for him as empathetic and as a champion of women in the
workplace — from women who work for him, a number of female lawmakers
and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump.

Speaking hours after Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin called in the National
Guard to restore order to Kenosha, Wis., where a police officer shot a
Black man this week, numerous Republicans led by Vice President Mike
Pence assailed Mr. Biden for what they claimed was his tolerance of the
vandalism that had grown out of racial justice protests, asserting that
the country would not be safe with him as president.

“Last week, Joe Biden didn’t say one word about the violence and chaos
engulfing cities across this country,” said Mr. Pence, standing before
an array of American flags at Fort McHenry in Baltimore and vowing: “We
will have law and order on the streets of this country for every
American of every race and creed and color.”

Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a strong supporter of the president,
said that places like Seattle, Portland, Ore., and other cities run by
Democrats were being “overrun by violent mobs.” She likened the violence
to the lead-up of the Civil War and asserted that people “are left to
fend for themselves.”

Ms. Noem invoked a young Abraham Lincoln, claiming he had been “alarmed
by the disregard for the rule of law throughout the country.”

“He was concerned for the people that had seen their property destroyed,
their families attacked and their lives threatened or even taken away,”
she said, adding “Sound familiar?”

The intense focus on the rioting amounted to an acknowledgment by
Republicans that they must reframe the election to make urban unrest the
central theme and shift attention away from the deaths and illnesses of
millions of people from the coronavirus.

For four years, Vice President Mike Pence has stood [as an unfailingly
loyal
deputy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/politics/mike-pence-trump-vp.html)
to President Trump — even and especially when he gets overruled.

In public and private, Mr. Pence lauds Mr. Trump. And on Wednesday
night, he used his convention speech to paint the president as a great
builder of the American economy and defender of American law
enforcement.

The vice president said that Mr. Trump was upholding the very nature of
the country, and if Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president, the
United States would lose its essential character and become
unrecognizable — at least to a Trump-friendly social conservative like
Mr. Pence.

“Last week, Joe Biden said democracy is on the ballot, but the truth is,
our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot.
But so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country,”
Mr. Pence said. “It’s not so much whether America will be more
conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The
choice in this election is whether America remains America.”

“So with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed
in me, the support of our Republican Party, and the grace of God, I
humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as vice president of the
United States,” Mr. Pence said.

Speaking to a crowd at Fort McHenry in Baltimore that did not appear to
be socially distanced or wearing masks, Mr. Pence described a president
who acts differently in private than he does in public — a picture
sharply at odds with nearly all of the reporting that depicts Mr. Trump
in private as even more prone to pique and outbursts than he is before
television cameras.

“I’ve seen him when the cameras are off,” Mr. Pence said. “Americans see
President Trump in lots of different ways, but there’s no doubt how
President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is, a nation
that has done more good in this world than any other, a nation that
deserves far more gratitude than grievance.”

Mr. Pence made the night’s first significant reference to Hurricane
Laura, [a major storm bearing down on Texas and
Louisiana](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/hurricane-laura-update.html),
a notion that would have not raised eyebrows during any other political
convention but seemed off-key during a week devoted to singing the
praises of Mr. Trump.

“This is a serious storm, and we urge all of those in the affected areas
to heed state and local authorities,” Mr. Pence said. “Stay safe, and
know that we will be with you every step of the way to support, rescue,
respond, and recover in the days and weeks ahead.”

In a seeming reference to Mr. Trump’s defense of Confederate monuments
and the Confederate flag, Mr. Pence, who is from Indiana, added: “If you
want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or
insulted, then he’s not your man.”

Mr. Pence was the only Republican convention speaker to mention Kenosha,
Wis., where the Sunday police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, has
inflamed racial tensions. He condemned people there who caused property
damage — though he made no mention of the shooting that prompted the
unrest.

“President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to
peacefully protest,” said Mr. Pence, who in 2017 flew to Indianapolis
for an N.F.L. game and then walked out after several players knelt
during the national anthem. “But rioting and looting is not peaceful
protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so
will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Mr. Pence, like many speakers during the Republican convention, also
sought to rewrite the recent history of how Mr. Trump has handled the
coronavirus pandemic, which has killed nearly 180,000 Americans and
counting.

“Before the first case of the coronavirus spread within the United
States, the president took unprecedented action and suspended all travel
from China, the second largest economy in the world,” Mr. Pence said.

Yet by April [40,000 people had traveled to the United States from
China](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html)
since Mr. Trump imposed his travel ban on Jan. 31, and more than 430,000
since the coronavirus was first disclosed in China a month earlier.

Mr. Pence also said Mr. Trump had “marshaled the full resources of our
federal government from the outset,” adding, “He directed us to forge a
seamless partnership with governors across America in both political
parties.”

This would come as a surprise to Democratic governors in Illinois, New
York and Washington State, among others, who found themselves on the
receiving end of Mr. Trump’s attacks for publicly criticizing the
federal government’s inability to produce personal protective equipment
or sufficient testing to determine how far the virus had spread in their
states.

The undiplomatic diplomat Richard A. Grenell, who briefly held a top
intelligence post in the Trump administration, revived [the baseless
theory](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/03/06/us/politics/fact-checking-trumps-defenses-of-his-wiretapping-claim.html)
that President Barack Obama personally ordered federal law enforcement
officials to spy on Donald J. Trump’s 2016 campaign.

“The Obama-Biden administration secretly launched a surveillance
operation on the Trump campaign, and silenced the many brave
intelligence officials who spoke up against it,” said Mr. Grenell, who
served as United States ambassador to Germany from 2018 to 2020, and
[alienated many German
officials](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-favorite-ambassador-makes-a-very-trumpian-splash-in-berlin-11563029427)
by weighing in on the country’s internal politics.

Mr. Grenell launched a far-ranging attack on Democratic foreign policy
initiatives, slamming the Iran nuclear deal and globalist goals he said
Mr. Biden would pursue.

“Washington stopped being the capital of the United States, and started
being the capital of the world,” he said of the Obama administration’s
approach.

In his remarks at the Republican convention on Wednesday, Mr. Grenell,
one of the few gay people to hold a high administration post under Mr.
Trump, claimed to have “watched President Trump charm the chancellor of
Germany, while insisting that Germany pay its NATO obligations.”

No one appears to have told that to the chancellor, Angela Merkel, who
has privately expressed doubts about Mr. Trump’s leadership and publicly
criticized his response to the coronavirus, albeit indirectly. “As we
are experiencing firsthand, you cannot fight the pandemic with lies and
disinformation,” [Ms. Merkel said in
June](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/world/meanwhile-in-america-july-10-intl/index.html).
“The limits of populism and denial of basic truths are being laid bare.”

This year, Mr. Grenell served briefly as acting director of national
intelligence. In that capacity, he was the first openly gay
cabinet-level official in United States history.

He claimed on Wednesday that this post gave him access to information
about Democratic investigations into possible “collusion” between the
Trump campaign and Russia four years ago that “made me sick to my
stomach.”

Mr. Grenell, known for dunking on reporters and critics on Twitter, had
no chance of being permanently confirmed for that position after Senator
Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said he was unqualified.

Since then, he has served as the Republican National Committee’s liaison
on L.G.B.T. outreach, a tall order at a time when Mr. Trump has made a
point of rolling back protections for transgender people enacted during
the Obama administration.

Clarence Henderson, who helped desegregate the Woolworth’s lunch counter
in Greensboro, N.C., in 1960, joined a chorus of Black Trump supporters
making the case that Mr. Trump is not racist — [even though as many as
eight in 10 Black people think he
is](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/17/politics/black-voters-trump-poll/index.html).

Mr. Henderson did not directly refer to the chaotic protests in
Portland, Ore., and Kenosha, Wis. But he contrasted his actions 60 years
ago — joining his friends at the counter on the second day of the
protests — with the current demonstrations.

“Our actions inspired similar protests throughout the South against
racial injustice. And in the end, segregation was abolished and our
country moved a step closer to true equality for all,” he said. “That’s
what actual peaceful protest can accomplish.”

The Greensboro demonstrations, while not the first sit-ins, were a
watershed moment in the civil rights movement — especially after the
media broadcast images of an unruly white mob dumping food and drinks on
the polite, neatly dressed and nonviolent protesters.

Lara Trump, President Trump’s daughter-in-law and a senior adviser to
his re-election campaign, offered a glowing portrait of the family she
had married into on Wednesday night, painting the Trumps as “warm” and
“caring.”

Speaking at the Republican National Convention, Ms. Trump, who is
married to Eric Trump, conceded that she had “certainly never thought
that I’d end up with the last name Trump.” But as soon as she met her
husband and joined his family, she said, “Any preconceived notion I had
of this family disappeared immediately.”

“I wasn’t born a Trump. I’m from the South,” she said. “I was raised a
Carolina girl. I went to public schools and worked my way through a
state university.”

“What I learned about our president is different than what you might
have heard,” she added. “I learned that he’s is a good man. That he
loves his family. That he didn’t need this job.”

With her remarks, Lara Trump joined the growing list of Trump family
members and close associates who have been tapped to praise the
president based on their relationship with him. They have sought to
soften the president’s image, suggesting that he treats the people he
cares about exceedingly well.

Ms. Trump also tried to use her firsthand experience to try to improve
her father-in-law’s standing with women, remarking that she had seen
women thrive in the Trump Organization, which granted them big
responsibilities.

“I know the promise of America because I’ve lived it, not just as a
member of the Trump family, but as a woman who knows what it’s like to
work in blue-collar jobs, to serve customers for tips and to aspire to
rise,” she said.

“No one on earth works harder for the American people,” she added later,
speaking about the president. “He’s willing to fight for his beliefs,
and for the people — and the country — that he loves.”

Burgess Owens, the Republican nominee in a Utah congressional district
that Democrats flipped in 2018, took the stage at the Republican
convention on Wednesday and recalled his great-great-grandfather, Silas
Burgess, who escaped slavery through the Underground Railroad and
ultimately became a landowner.

He also recalled his own experience: After playing in the N.F.L., he
started a business that failed, and ended up working as a chimney sweep
before achieving “a rewarding career in the corporate world.”

“Career politicians, elitists and even a former bartender want us to
believe that’s impossible,” Mr. Owens said, referring to Representative
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by her former job. “They want us to believe
that what I did, what my great-great-grandfather did, is impossible for
ordinary Americans. As patriots, we know better.”

Mr. Owens, who is also a Fox News contributor, is running against
Representative Ben McAdams in Utah’s Fourth Congressional District. Mr.
McAdams [narrowly upset a Republican
incumbent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/20/us/politics/mia-love-utah-loses.html),

of plagiarizing parts of his book “Why I Stand: From Freedom to the

[denied](https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-4th-district-gop-nominee-burgess-owens-defends-book-from-plagiarism-allegations).
Also this week, [The Salt Lake Tribune
reported](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/08/25/former-utah-lawmaker/)
that a former Utah legislator was urging the Republican National
Committee to revoke his speaking slot because he appeared earlier this
year on a YouTube program associated with [the false QAnon conspiracy
theory](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/what-is-qanon.html).

Mr. Owens has said that he didn’t know about the link and that he does
not support QAnon.

Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, the only endangered Senate Republican to
speak at this week’s Republican National Convention, on Wednesday night
highlighted President Trump’s help for farmers and claimed that a Biden
administration would harm them.

“I can’t recall an administration more hostile to farmers than
Obama-Biden, unless you count the Biden-Harris ticket,” Ms. Ernst said.
“The Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing this so-called Green New
Deal. If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and
eliminate gas-powered cars. It would destroy the agriculture industry,
not just here in Iowa, but throughout the country.”

Mr. Biden has promised no such thing. He never endorsed the Green New
Deal, much to the frustration of his party’s more progressive elements.
He has endorsed reinstating higher fuel efficiency standards put in
place by President Barack Obama and rescinded by Mr. Trump.

Ms. Ernst, who won in the 2014 Republican wave and faces a tight
challenge this year, is betting her best chance to secure re-election is
by tethering herself tightly to President Trump. On Wednesday she kept
her remarks narrowly focused on Iowa, praising Mr. Trump for visiting
the state after a storm damaged much of the state this month.

Like many speakers during the convention, Ms. Ernst laced her remarks
with heavy criticism of the national news media — and praise for the
president, who she said had bent media coverage to his will.

After the storm, Ms. Ernst said, “most of the national media looked the
other way. To them, Iowa is still just flyover country.” She added,
“When President Trump came to Cedar Rapids, the national media finally
did, too.”

There is scarce public polling in Iowa, but a poll from [The Des Moines
Register in June showed Ms. Ernst’s Democratic opponent, Theresa
Greenfield, ahead by three percentage
points](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/20/us/politics/iowa-polls-trump-biden-ernst-greenfield.html).
This month, a Monmouth poll showed Ms. Ernst ahead by one point; each
candidate’s polling lead was within the margin of error.

The race has already set fund-raising records for an Iowa Senate
contest, and is expected to result in more money spent on TV advertising
than ever before in the state.

Ms. Ernst’s convention appearance could only be better for her than her
2016 speech in Cleveland, which was largely overshadowed by the debut,
directly before she took the stage, of the “lock her up” chant led by
Michael T. Flynn, a Trump campaign adviser at the time. Mr. Flynn spoke
for far longer than his allotted time, and Ms. Ernst was given less time
to speak than she had planned for.

On Wednesday night, Ms. Ernst’s remarks, which were recorded from Des
Moines, followed a prerecorded veterans’ round-table discussion.

In her 2014 campaign, Ms. Ernst pledged to repeal the Affordable Care
Act, balance the federal budget and cut spending. “Let’s make ’em
squeal,” [she said in a viral
ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8uLuHsNw0), highlighting her
history castrating hogs on her family’s farm.

But after Mr. Trump’s election in 2016 — Ms. Ernst had an interview with
him when he was in search of a running mate — she backed away from her
campaign promises to become one of the president’s stalwart defenders.

[Her first 2020 TV ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhVzDaU9WSs)
echoes Mr. Trump’s tone on China.

“We rely on Communist China for far too much, from technology to
medicine,” she said. “So I’m fighting to bring it home.”

For at least a decade, Representative Lee Zeldin of New York has been
promoted as a Republican rising star.

Mr. Zeldin, 40, is a lawyer and Iraq war veteran from Long Island who
first won election to the New York State Senate in 2010 by campaigning
against a payroll tax that funded the New York subway and commuter
railways.

Since he was elected to Congress in the 2014 Republican wave, Mr. Zeldin
has become a staunch supporter of President Trump, who carried Mr.
Zeldin’s eastern Long Island congressional district by 12 percentage
points after Barack Obama had won it in the 2008 and 2012 elections.

Mr. Zeldin’s defense of Mr. Trump during the initial House impeachment
proceedings was so thorough that no Republican spoke more than he did,
according to [a review of early deposition transcripts last year by NBC
News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-s-defender-how-little-known-gop-lawmaker-became-point-n1076046).

On Wednesday night he used his four-minute Republican convention
speaking slot to praise Mr. Trump — and his son-in-law Jared Kushner —
for providing his district in Suffolk County and New York City with
personal protective equipment for medical workers caring for coronavirus
patients.

“Jared Kushner and I were on the phone late” one Saturday night, Mr.
Zeldin said. “The very next day, President Trump announced he was
sending us 200,000 N95 masks. He actually delivered more than 400,000.”

Mr. Zeldin’s praise for the Trump administration neglects to mention
what was [a nationwide
shortage](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/face-masks-coronavirus.html)
in medical-grade masks and other protective equipment for doctors and
nurses. The Trump administration’s response was a scattershot effort
that led to various governors’ begging the White House for help and
offering public praise of Mr. Trump, some of which has been used in
footage that has been aired during this week’s Republican National
Convention. And [New York’s hospitals were not able to handle all of the
patients](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html)
suffering from the pandemic.

Mr. Zeldin, one of just two Jewish Republicans in Congress, won
re-election relatively easily in 2016 and 2018, but faces a significant
challenge this year from Nancy Goroff, a chemistry professor at Stony
Brook University. The Cook Political Report rates the contest as “Lean
Republican,” and the House Democrats’ campaign arm on Wednesday added
Ms. Goroff to its “Red to Blue” list of most competitive races.

The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng on Wednesday praised President
Trump’s handling of relations with China and said he had “shown the
courage” to stand up to China’s Communist Party.

In China, “expressing beliefs or ideas not approved by the C.C.P. —
religion, democracy, human rights — can lead to prison,” Mr. Chen said
at the Republican convention. “The nation lives under mass surveillance
and censorship.”

He added: “The U.S. must use its values of freedom, democracy and the
rule of law to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop C.C.P.’s
aggression. President Trump has led on this, and we need the other
countries to join him in this fight.”

Mr. Chen, who was persecuted and confined to his home by the Chinese

</div>

Madison Cawthorn, a 25-year-old House candidate in North Carolina vying
to fill the seat vacated by Mark Meadows, the White House chief of
staff, offered himself as the future of the Republican Party on
Wednesday night at its convention.

In remarks that — highly unusual at this convention — focused on himself
instead of President Trump, Mr. Cawthorn placed himself in the company
of twentysomething founding fathers: George Washington, who received a
military commission at 21; Abraham Lincoln, who ran for office at 22;
and James Madison, who Mr. Cawthorn said signed the Declaration of
Independence at 25.

(Mr. Madison, who was 25 in 1776, [did not sign the Declaration of
Independence.](https://declaration.fas.harvard.edu/faq/founding-fathers-not-signers#:~:text=George%20Washington%2C%20John%20Jay%2C%20Alexander,signed%20the%20Declaration%20of%20Independence.&text=When%20Madison%20became%20a%20delegate,delegate%2C%20just%2029%20years%20old.))

“In times of peril, young people have stepped up and saved this country
abroad and at home,” Mr. Cawthorn said. “We held the line, scaled the
cliffs, crossed oceans, liberated camps and cracked codes.”

As his remarks ended, Mr. Cawthorn, who is paralyzed from the waist
down, dramatically lifted himself up onto a walker as he recited the
phrase “to the republic, for which I stand.”

It was a moment seemingly intended to go viral, fitting with how Mr.
Cawthorn rocketed to national prominence in June, when he upset a
Trump-endorsed candidate to win his primary.

He was just 24 years old, a self-described real estate investor who uses
a wheelchair after being paralyzed from a car crash. The crash, he said
at the time, “derailed” plans to attend the Naval Academy.

But as it turned out, Mr. Cawthorn — who has since turned 25, the legal
age to serve in the House — has little real estate portfolio to speak
of, [had his application to the Naval Academy
rejected](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2020/08/12/madison-cawthorns-claim-naval-academy-creates-false-impression/3350634001/)
before his car accident, and once drew scrutiny for a post on social
media about Adolf Hitler.

This month, [Jezebel unearthed several pictures on Mr. Cawthorn’s
Instagram
page](https://theslot.jezebel.com/my-dark-journey-into-the-soul-of-a-model-young-republic-1844324325)
from a 2017 trip he had taken to Germany. There, he visited Hitler’s
vacation home.

“The vacation house of the Führer,” he wrote. “Seeing the Eagles Nest
has been on my bucket list for awhile, it did not disappoint.”

He added: “Strange to hear so many laughs and share such a good time
with my brother where only 79 years ago a supreme evil shared laughs and
good times with his compatriots.”

<div class="css-yp7nq2 eyr2lxc0">

</div>

Mr. Cawthorn [later wrote on
Facebook](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/Cawthorn2020/posts/188242366048733)
that he had visited the historical site to celebrate the Allies’ victory
over Nazi Germany. [In a subsequent
video](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/Cawthorn2020/posts/189816922557944),
he said political attacks suggesting he had affinity for the Nazi regime
were “an attack on disabled people.”

During his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Cawthorn made no mention or allusion
to his social media posts. Instead he made a call, during a convention
otherwise devoted to trashing liberals as America-haters, for both sides
of the political spectrum to get along.

“We are committed to building a new town square,” he said. “To liberals,
I say let’s have a conversation. Be a true liberal, listen to other
ideas and let the best ones prevail. And to conservatives, let’s define
what we support and win the argument in areas like health care and on
the environment.”

Mr. Cawthorn is almost certain to win his general election and go to
Washington next year. Mr. Trump carried Mr. Cawthorn’s western North
Carolina district by 17 percentage points in 2016. Mr. Cawthorn’s
campaign did not make him available to be interviewed.

Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the youngest Republican woman
elected to Congress, called President Trump “the only candidate who will
stand up for hardworking families and protect the American dream for
future generations.”

Echoing many other convention speakers this week, Ms. Stefanik framed
the election as “a choice between the far-left democratic socialist
agenda versus protecting and preserving the American dream.” (The
Democratic nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., from the party’s center-left
wing, does not advocate socialism and won the primary over candidates
from the left.)

“President Trump is working to safely reopen our Main Street economy,”
she said. “He understands that the engine of our country is fueled by
the ingenuity and determination of American workers, entrepreneurs and
small businesses. Joe Biden wants to keep them locked up in the basement
and crush them with $4 trillion in new taxes.”

Ms. Stefanik, who was the [youngest member of
Congress](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2014/10/29/nyregion/in-upstate-new-york-house-race-republican-makes-her-youth-a-selling-point.html)
from either party when she was elected in 2014, developed a moderate,
bipartisan reputation in her first few years in office, and sometimes
clashed with leadership over the party’s future. She [called for a
post-mortem
analysis](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/12/20/nyregion/elise-stefanik-republican-women.html)
after the 2018 midterms and has criticized Republican leaders for not
devoting more resources [to electing
women](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/07/09/us/politics/republican-women-congress.html);
she started her own political action committee to support Republican
women running for Congress.

But during President Trump’s impeachment hearings, Ms. Stefanik [took a
much sharper
tone](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/18/nyregion/elise-stefanik-tedra-cobb-impeachment.html),
at one point accusing the Democratic committee leader, Representative
Adam B. Schiff, of trying to silence her and her colleagues “simply
because we are Republicans.” Mr. Trump tweeted his approval.

Since then, Ms. Stefanik’s Twitter feed has become more reminiscent of
Mr. Trump’s, complete with a nickname for her Democratic opponent, Tedra
Cobb: “Taxin’ Tedra.”

That tone also characterized her convention speech, in which she said
Mr. Trump had “fought tirelessly to deliver results for all Americans,
despite the Democrats’ baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the
media’s endless obsession with it.”

“I was proud to lead the effort standing up for the Constitution,
President Trump and, most importantly, the American people,” she said.
“This attack was not just on the president. It was an attack on you,
your voice and your vote.”

Ms. Stefanik said that Americans had not been swayed, and that “our
support for President Trump is stronger than ever before,” though Mr.
Trump’s approval rating in the [RealClearPolitics
average](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html)
is lower now than it was the day the Senate acquitted him in February.

The head of a national organization that advocates on behalf of law
enforcement hailed President Trump as a staunch defender of the police
on Wednesday night at the Republican National Convention amid national
upheaval over the police killing of a Black man in Kenosha, Wis.

The speaker, Michael “Mick” McHale, leads the National Association of
Police Organizations, a coalition of police unions and associations from
across the country. He praised Mr. Trump for his “support of aggressive
federal prosecution of those who attack our police officers” and
baselessly claimed that<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Joseph
R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, had allowed his campaign to be
taken over by people who are “anti-law enforcement.”

“I’m proud that the overwhelming majority of American police officers
are the best of the best and put their lives on the line without
hesitation,” said Mr. McHale, who [met with Mr. Trump at the White House
last
month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-national-association-police-organizations-leadership/)
and whose organization has endorsed him. “Good officers need to know
that their elected leaders and the department brass have their backs.”

Mr. **** McHale’s implicit condemnation of those who have criticized the
police and their use of force comes at a time of unrest in Kenosha,
after a video showed a [police officer shooting Jacob
Blake](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html),
a Black man, seven times in the back. Two people were killed and a third
was seriously injured in the protests that followed, and a white
teenager who was not affiliated with the protesters was arrested and
charged with murder.

Mr. McHale’s dark language reflected the [foreboding tone speakers have
used throughout the Republican
convention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/politics/republican-convention-recap.html),
as they have sought to paint a picture of the United States under
Democratic leadership as a dystopian country plagued by violence.

Citing what he described as “chaos” in cities like Portland,
Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York in recent months, where protesters
have taken to the streets to condemn police violence and the killing of
George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, Mr. **** McHale echoed the
Trump campaign in asserting that when elected leaders “make the
conscious decision not to support law
enforcement,”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>shootings,
“murders, looting and rioting occur unabated.”

His claim is exaggerated; violent crime has risen by about 0.4 percent
compared to the same period last year across 25 large American cities,
[according](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F07%2F06%2Fupshot%2Fmurders-rising-crime-coronavirus.html)
to the latest available
[data](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1Z9b5mIwztAwmEHJW7Q5DHMjS14-Rs7XIXOt33Al_rDw%2Fedit%23gid%3D1774879893).

Mr. Trump has repeatedly stressed the need for “law and order” and has
embraced the notion of himself as a defender of law enforcement at a
time when some progressives — fed up with the killing of Black people by
the authorities — have called for defunding the police or in some way
lessening their broad roles and responsibilities in communities.

This month, a union representing tens of thousands of New York City
police officers [endorsed Mr.
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/us/elections/a-new-york-police-union-endorses-trump.html)
and became what his campaign said at the time was the sixth police
association to do so.

But Mr. Trump has also frequently attacked the country’s top law
enforcement officers and sharply criticized institutions like the
Justice Department and F.B.I. His relentless critiques of the F.B.I. in
relation to its agents’ role in the special counsel inquiry that led to
his impeachment has caused both Democrats and Republicans to worry that
the president has undermined public confidence in law enforcement.

Kellyanne Conway, President Trump’s homestretch campaign manager in
2016, made the case that Mr. Trump, contrary to his image, was a
proponent of women’s empowerment.

“A woman in a leadership role<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>can still seem novel,” Ms. Conway said on Wednesday, which was
also Women’s Equality Day.

“Not so for President Trump. For decades, he has elevated women to
senior positions in business and in government. He confides in and
consults us, respects our opinions, and insists that we are on equal
footing with the men. President Trump helped me shatter a barrier in the
world of politics by empowering me to manage his campaign to its
successful conclusion.”

Some women who worked for Mr. Trump’s development company have painted a
different picture, claiming that while Mr. Trump hired and promoted
women to positions of authority, [he sometimes ridiculed them over their
physical
appearance.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-a-champion-of-women-his-female-employees-think-so/2015/11/23/7eafac80-88da-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html)

Ms. Conway announced last week that she was [stepping down from her post
as presidential
counselor](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/politics/kellyanne-conway-leaving-white-house.html)
to spend more time with her family after a long series of social media
posts from her teenage daughter criticizing her work for Mr. Trump.

Ms. Conway’s husband, George — a conservative lawyer who has emerged as
one of the president’s most pointed and prolific Twitter hecklers —
announced that he was leaving his position with the Lincoln Project, an
anti-Trump group, at the same time Ms. Conway revealed her White House
departure.

Ms. Conway, a longtime Republican pollster, lasted longer in Mr. Trump’s
inner circle than almost anyone outside of his family, in part because
she was able to pull off an unlikely balancing act — engaging with the
news media as she tried to undermine its standing over negative coverage
of the president.

But she is likely to be remembered for coining one of the most memorable
one-liners of Mr. Trump’s presidency. When pressed about the
administration’s inflated claims about the size of the inauguration
crowd in 2017, she described those numbers as [“alternative
facts.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/22/kellyanne-conway-says-donald-trumps-team-has-alternate-facts-which-pretty-much-says-it-all/)

Karen Pence, who reportedly expressed reservations about her husband’s
acceptance of Mr. Trump’s running-mate offer, on Wednesday made one of
the least overtly political speeches yet at the Republican convention,
focusing on her work with veterans and military spouses.

“I have had the honor of meeting many heroes across this great country,”
said Ms. Pence, an artist and educator who has supported art therapy
programs geared at helping veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“Many of our veteran heroes struggle as they transition back into
civilian life,” Ms. Pence said. “Sometimes the stress is too difficult
to manage alone.”

Ms. Pence said she had been motivated by family members who have served
in the military.

“The Pences are a military family,” she said. “Our son, Michael, serves
in the United States Marines, and our son-in-law, Henry, serves in the
U.S. Navy.”

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, described how
President Trump offered words of support after she underwent a
preventive mastectomy two years ago.

“During one of my most difficult times, I expected to have the support
of my family, but I had more support than I knew,” Ms. McEnany said. “As
I came out of anesthesia, one of the first calls I received was from
Ivanka Trump. As I recovered, my phone rang again. It was President
Trump, calling to check on me. I was blown away.”

Ms. McEnany’s testimony added another voice to the chorus of speakers at
the Republican National Convention who have sought to paint Mr. Trump in
a softer and more compassionate light. Ms. McEnany was a late addition
to the schedule, people involved in the planning said.

Ms. McEnany became the latest woman on Mr. Trump’s staff who has
defended him by pointing to her personal experience with him. Ivanka
Trump, the president’s elder daughter, and Kellyanne Conway, the
outgoing White House counselor, have often defended the president’s
behavior by noting that he doesn’t treat them, personally, differently
from men on his staff.

On Tuesday, Melania Trump, the first lady, became one of the only R.N.C.
speakers [to acknowledge the lives lost to the
coronavirus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/politics/melania-trump.html),
as she tried to cast a softer light on her husband’s presidency, which
has often been filled with anger and derision.

In her own speech, Ms. McEnany told voters of the trials of raising a
small child and of living with a health condition. (She had [previously
written](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kayleigh-mcenany-preventative-double-mastectomy-age-30)
about undergoing a preventive double mastectomy to lower her risk of
breast cancer after testing positive for the BRCA2 mutation.)

She said Mr. Trump “stands by Americans with pre-existing conditions,”
despite the fact that Mr. Trump supports undoing the Affordable Care
Act’s protections for those with such conditions.

Her remarks were part of a broader project to make Mr. Trump more
palatable to women. Tuesday’s program, for instance, included a
prerecorded video which praised Mr. Trump’s record of promoting women to
key positions in the White House.

Ms. McEnany, who was the national press secretary for Mr. Trump’s 2020
re-election campaign before [being named his fourth White House press
secretary earlier this
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/07/us/politics/kayleigh-mcenany-stephanie-grisham-trump.html),
also told viewers about her 9-month-old daughter, framing her fight for
Mr. Trump as a fight for to protect her daughter’s future.

“I choose to work for this president for her,” she said. “When I look
into my baby’s eyes, I see a new life, a miracle for which I have a
solemn responsibility to protect. That means protecting America’s future
— a future President Trump will fight for.”

Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas, a retired Navy SEAL who was
elected to Congress in 2018, drew on his experience fighting in
Afghanistan to paint America as a “country of heroes” and shared
sacrifice in a speech on Wednesday night at the Republican convention.

Mr. Crenshaw, who was deployed five times before being medically retired
in 2016, spoke of a friend on the battlefield who had helped ensure his
survival, but was killed just weeks later. And as he emphasized a theme
of Wednesday’s programming, he sought to highlight everyday Americans as
heroes, while also leveling a series of implicit critiques at those who
have challenged the status quo and fought for racial justice.

“It’s the parent who will relearn algebra because there’s no way they’re
letting their kid fall behind while schools are closed,” he said. “And
it’s the cop that gets spit on one day and will save a child’s life the
next.”

“Heroism is self-sacrifice, not moralizing and lecturing over others
when they disagree,” he added. “Heroism is grace, not perpetual outrage.
Heroism is rebuilding our communities, not destroying them. Heroism is
renewing faith in the symbols that unite us, not tearing them down.”

Mr. Crenshaw, who represents an area surrounding Houston, [won his 2018
race by more than seven percentage
points](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/elections/results/texas-house-district-2)
in a
[Republican-leaning](https://cookpolitical.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/EC%20Ratings.072320.2.pdf)

lawyer and political
activist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/26/dan-crenshaw-sima-ladjevardian-texas-congressional-race/)
who was previously an adviser to Beto O’Rourke.

Mr. Trump bested Hillary Clinton by[nine percentage points in Texas
in 2016](https://cookpolitical.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/EC%20Ratings.072320.2.pdf),
but [several recent
polls](https://www.texasdemocrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TexasResults-1-1.pdf)
have shown him in a much tighter race four years later with Mr. Biden.

Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee gave a dark convention speech,
claiming that Democrats wanted to “cancel” law enforcement and service
members.

“Leftists try to turn them into villains, they want to cancel them, but
I’m here to tell you these heroes can’t be canceled,” said Ms.
Blackburn, a firebrand conservative and one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal
defenders. “As hard as Democrats try, they can’t cancel our heroes. They
can’t contest their bravery, and they can’t dismiss the powerful sense
of service that lives deep in their souls. So they try to defund them —
our military, our police, even ICE — to take away their tools to keep us
safe.”

Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, does not support defunding
the police or ICE. Nor does he support “defunding” the military, though
he expressed openness during the primary to reducing the defense budget
somewhat.

Delving deeply into [the culture-war
rhetoric](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/20/us/politics/coronavirus-protests-democrats-republicans.html)
that has dominated much of the Republican Party during the coronavirus
pandemic, Ms. Blackburn criticized lockdown restrictions that, in some
places, closed churches while allowing liquor stores and abortion
clinics to stay open. (Churches, and other indoor spaces where large
groups of people gather for extended periods of time, have been linked
to much more coronavirus transmission than stores or clinics.)

In a fear-mongering message, she also suggested that Democrats wanted to
control Americans.

“If the Democrats had their way, they would keep you locked in your
house until you become dependent on the government for everything,” she
said. “That sounds a lot like Communist China to me.”

Ms. Blackburn, who was elected to the Senate in 2018 after more than 15
years in the House, was known for much of her career for her opposition
to abortion, though she [turned to a broader pro-Trump
message](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/09/09/us/politics/blackburn-abortion-tennessee-senate.html)
both in her most recent campaign and in her speech on Tuesday. She led a
House committee that investigated allegations in 2015 and 2016 that
Planned Parenthood had sold fetal tissue for profit; neither the
congressional investigation nor multiple state-level inquiries
[substantiated those
allegations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/15/us/planned-parenthood-lawsuit-secret-videos.html).

Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota is one of Mr. Trump’s favorite admirers
— so popular, in fact, that rumors have swirled from time to time that
she might be called upon to replace Wednesday night’s keynote speaker,
Mike Pence, on the 2020 ticket.

Ms. Noem echoed Mr. Trump’s hard-edge language against demonstrators
protesting police violence in her speech, hours after a pro-Trump
teenager from Illinois was arrested in connection with the killing of
two protesters in Kenosha, Wis., after the police shooting of a Black
man, Jacob Blake.

“From Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run
cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs,” she said.
“The violence is rampant. There’s looting, chaos, destruction, and
murder. People that can afford to flee have fled. But the people that
can’t — good, hard-working Americans — are left to fend for themselves.”

Ms. Noem, the first female governor of her state, has been a vocal
supporter of Mr. Trump’s law-and-order campaign, and ushered through a
law lifting a requirement for licenses for concealed firearms as one of
her first actions after being elected in 2018.

When the president went so far as to suggest, [according to the Argus
Leader](https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2018/04/24/president-donald-trump-mount-rushmore-trumpmore/544597002/),
that he aspired to see his own chiseled visage on Mount Rushmore
someday, Ms. Noem (who has no say over such matters) seemed open to the
suggestion.

She even ordered up [a four-foot-tall model of the statue with a fifth
face on
it](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/08/us/politics/kristi-noem-pence-trump.html)
(his). The president returned the favor with an appearance at the
national monument earlier this year, a boon to one of his most
unapologetic defenders.

protesting a police shooting in Kenosha, Wis., threatens to overshadow
the third night of a Republican convention that has portrayed President
Trump as a bulwark against chaos and unrest.

By late Wednesday, a storm of discordant news descended on the
Republican convention bubble in Washington as a strengthening Hurricane
Laura menaced Louisiana and Texas.

The shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by the police [in
Kenosha](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/jacob-blake-kenosha-fires.html),
a city of 100,000 people between Chicago and Milwaukee, has created a
powerful and growing cascade of reaction that could influence the
content — and certainly the context — of speeches scheduled to be
delivered by Vice President Mike Pence and others.

Planners would not say if they were making any changes to address the
developments.

The NBA scrapped its playoff schedule after Milwaukee Bucks players
announced a boycott in protest of the shooting of Mr. Blake as Democrats
condemned the inclusion on Monday night’s program of a Missouri couple
who had brandished weapons at protesters in the wake of George Floyd’s
killing.

President Trump sought to seize the initiative early Wednesday,
announcing that he would deploy the National Guard and other law
enforcement to Kenosha, Wis., to quell the unrest that has erupted since
the police there shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, on Sunday.

“I will be sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to
Kenosha, WI to restore LAW and ORDER\!” Mr. Trump [wrote on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1298671449968959490).

But the focus quickly shifted back to the tenor of his campaign, when it
became apparent that the suspected gunman, Kyle Rittenhouse, was a white
pro-police activist, and not one of the protesters demonstrating against
the police.

Late Wednesday, [Buzzfeed reported that Mr. Rittenhouse appeared to
be](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/kenosha-suspect-kyle-rittenhouse-trump-rally)
in the front row of a Trump campaign rally in January, standing not far
from the president.

The shooting took place as a crowd was gathering near a gas station,
where protesters encountered a group of men who were carrying guns and
saying they wanted to protect the area from looting.

Mr. Blake, 29, was [shot several times in the back by a police
officer](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/us/kenosha-police-shooting.html)
as he tried to get into the driver-side door of an S.U.V. His three
children were in the back seat. Mr. Blake was paralyzed from the waist
down, his father said.

Within hours of the shooting, graphic video of it taken by a neighbor
raced across social media, and
[Kenosha](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/us/jacob-blake-kenosha-fires.html)
erupted into protest, looting and fires downtown. Officers used tear gas
to try to disperse protesters.

Protests continued on Monday and Tuesday, and on Tuesday night, a
face-off at a gas station between protesters and armed men who promised
to protect the property turned into the violent confrontation that led
to Mr. Rittenhouse’s arrest. In addition to the two people shot dead, a
third was left seriously injured.

## [Some of the immigrants Trump naturalized on Tuesday didn’t know they were being broadcast.](#some-of-the-immigrants-trump-naturalized-on-tuesday-didnt-know-they-were-being-broadcast)

</div>

In one of the most striking moments of the second night of the
Republican convention on Tuesday — both for its content and for its
blatant disregard of the separation between the White House and the
campaign trail — President Trump held a naturalization ceremony for five
immigrants.

It was an obvious effort by Mr. Trump’s campaign to cast him as
pro-immigrant after three and a half years of anti-immigrant policies.
But at least two of the five new citizens were not told it was being
broadcast at the convention.

The decision by Mr. Trump’s campaign to feature the naturalization
ceremony angered some senior officials with U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services. Some asylum officers confronted senior agency
officials during a virtual town hall on Wednesday about whether Chad F.
Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, had
violated rules prohibiting political activity by presiding over the
ceremony.

“It’s one of the things that shouldn’t be politicized, and you can
hardly get more political than your partisan political convention,” said
Barbara Strack, a former chief of the refugee affairs division at
Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Bush and Obama
administrations.

## [The Trump campaign has gone dark on broadcast TV for the second time in a month.](#the-trump-campaign-has-gone-dark-on-broadcast-tv-for-the-second-time-in-a-month)

</div>

The Trump campaign has halted its broadcast television advertising
campaign, pulling down all broadcast ads on Tuesday with no new ads
scheduled to start until Sept. 8, a two-week dark period with less than
70 days to go until the election.

It is the second time over the past 30 days that the Trump campaign has
gone completely dark on broadcast television, having paused advertising
in late July following the shift in leadership as Bill Stepien took over
as campaign manager from Brad Parscale. They are maintaining a presence
on national cable.

The pause comes as the Biden campaign has been amping up its television
advertising presence. In the period that the Trump campaign is slated to
be dark, the Biden campaign has roughly $20 million booked in
battleground states. In the immediate aftermath of the convention, the
Biden campaign will have the airwaves to itself.

In a statement, the Trump campaign said the recent campaigning by
President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, combined with the
coverage of the convention, was enough media to carry them. The campaign
also said, “we will be back up on broadcast TV well before September
8th.”

“Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence have been visibly visiting battleground states,
meeting actual voters and dominating local news coverage,” said Tim
Murtaugh, the communications director for the Trump campaign. “It also
makes little sense to blow donor money on ads during convention weeks,
when all of the national media is focused on the candidates anyway. Our
continuing massive digital presence, with special emphasis on the
convention weeks, should not be discounted.”

The post-convention break follows a similar pause during Mr. Trump’s
2016 campaign, when he stopped all television advertising for nearly a
month after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention in
Cleveland. But that convention ended in mid July, and he was not the
well-funded incumbent he is now. Even so, the 2016 Trump campaign was
advertising by late August.

The campaign has kept up a notable digital advertising presence,
spending nearly $4 million on Facebook alone over the past week. There
is no publicly available method of tracking future reservations for
digital advertising.

Federal officials on Wednesday reported no evidence of coordinated fraud
in the implementation of state vote-by-mail efforts, dealing a blow to
President Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that voting by mail will spur a
wave of rigged balloting.

Officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the F.B.I., and the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence said their investigators
had not found any cases of widespread attempts to use the Postal Service
to illegally influence the election, [during a background briefing with
reporters in
Washington.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/26/us/politics/mail-in-voting-foreign-intervention.html)

Such efforts would be difficult to execute given the sprawling and
decentralized system of voting even if someone tried, they said.

“We have yet to see any activity to prevent voting or to change votes,
and we continue to think it would be extraordinarily difficult for
foreign adversaries to change vote tallies,” the deputy attorney general
under Mr. Barr, Jeffrey A. Rosen, said in separate remarks for the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Their assessment is in line with those of state officials who have
argued that vastly increasing the use of mail-in voting is the only way
to ensure that people concerned about contracting coronavirus by voting
in person are not disenfranchised.

Mr. Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr have cast doubt on the
security of mail ballots, despite assurances from elections officials in
both parties that [mail-in voting poses only minimal
risks.](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/494189-lets-put-the-vote-by-mail-fraud-myth-to-rest)

In July, and [again this
month](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-press-briefing-august-13-2020/),
Mr. Trump has raised the possibility, without evidence, that foreign
adversaries would forge mail-in ballots and rig the election. Mr. Trump
said the widespread use of mail-in and other absentee balloting is
“going to be the greatest election disaster in history.”

“You guys like to talk about Russia and China and other places, they’ll
be able to forge ballots, they’ll forge up, they’ll do whatever they
have to do,” Mr. Trump said in July.
