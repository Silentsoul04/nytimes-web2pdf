  - Republicans used the third night of their national convention to
    craft a portrait of President Trump as a fierce supporter of social
    conservatives, the military and women, often using exaggeration and
    hype that papered over Mr. Trump’s personal history and policy
    record during the last four years. Times correspondents provided
    context, analysis and fact-checking throughout the night.

<!-- end list -->

  - In the wake of new violence in Wisconsin, Vice President Mike Pence
    gravely claimed that “you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America” as
    other speakers incorrectly asserted that Mr. Biden has said he would
    “defund the police.” He has not.

  - Several of the speakers focused on the president’s national security
    credentials, at times overstating Mr. Trump’s accomplishments on the
    world stage as they sought to counter Mr. Biden’s decades of foreign
    policy experience.

  - As they did during the first two days of the convention, the
    Republican speakers rarely mentioned the coronavirus pandemic, even
    though Mr. Pence has led the White House’s task force. When they did
    refer to the global crisis, the speakers largely downplayed the
    threat or misstated the government’s response, as one lawmaker did
    when he said the administration “authorized testing requests at
    blazing speed.” It did
not.

## [“Joe Biden criticized President Trump following his decision to rid the world of both of those terrorists. But it’s not surprising because history records that Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden.”](#joe-biden-criticized-president-trump-following-his-decision-to-rid-the-world-of-both-of-those-terrorists-but-its-not-surprising-)

</div>

— Vice President Mike Pence

### <span>**This is misleading.**</span>

Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has offered shifting accounts
of how he counseled then President Barack Obama. It is clear that he was
more skeptical than most other Obama officials about the May 2011
operation that killed the Osama bin Laden. But saying that he opposed
the raid outright is at best a selective interpretation of the available
evidence.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

In the months after Mr. Obama ordered the risky mission, Mr. Biden said
he had been skeptical of the unconfirmed intelligence showing that bin
Laden was hiding in a compound in Pakistan. In January 2012, he
[recalled](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/joe-biden-advised-against-the-osama-bin-laden-raid)
having told Mr. Obama in a final Situation Room meeting when top
officials were polled on their positions: “Mr. President, my suggestion
is, don’t go.” But he implied that his view was subject to change,
saying that more work should be done “to see if he’s there.”

A few months later, he [added more
detail](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47311900/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/may-joe-biden-kelly-ayotte-diane-swonk-tom-brokaw-chuck-todd/#.X0chN9NKjCB)
to his account, saying that he spoke privately with Mr. Obama after that
Situation Room meeting and told him, “Follow your instincts, Mr.
President.” At the time, Mr. Biden recounted, “I knew he was going to
go,” thus indicating that he was implicitly endorsing Mr. Obama’s
decision to act.

In 2015, Mr. Biden offered a [new
account](https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/joe-biden-and-walter-mondale-discuss-%E2%80%98new-modern-vice-presidency%E2%80%99)
of his private exchange with Mr. Obama after the meeting. “I told him my
opinion, that I thought he should go, but follow his own instincts,” Mr.
Biden said. “Imagine if I had said in front of everyone, ‘Don’t go,’ or
‘Go,’ and his decision was a different decision. It undercuts that
relationship.” That analysis conflicts with his first account of telling
Mr. Obama to delay the operation.

Subsequent books by former Obama officials describe Mr. Biden as
skeptical of the intelligence and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates
recounted that “Biden’s primary concern was the political consequences
of failure.” Mr. Biden’s own 2017 memoir does not mention the bin Laden
raid, and Mr. Obama has not commented on the matter.

Mr. Pence was making a point about the need to support law enforcement
as protests occurred around the country in the wake of the killing of
George Floyd. But he failed to mention that [the
man](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F06%2F16%2Fus%2Fsteven-carrillo-air-force-boogaloo.html)charged
with killing Mr. Underwood was an Air Force sergeant linked to a
far-right anti-government movement. The suspect, Staff Sgt. Steven
Carrillo, 32, had expressed his allegiance to the boogaloo, an extremist
ideology that seeks to bring about a second civil war to overthrow the
United States government. F.B.I. officials said that Sergeant Carrillo
had traveled to Oakland to “kill cops.”

In its news release announcing the charges against Sergeant Carrillo and
another man who participated, a Justice Department official
[said](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Fopa%2Fpr%2Ftwo-defendants-charged-murder-and-aiding-and-abetting-slaying-federal-protective-service),
“The Department of Justice stands in support of all Americans exercising
their First Amendment rights to peaceable assembly and speech but we
stand firmly against anyone who seeks to hijack the protests with acts
of violence and destruction.”

</div>

— Vice President Mike Pence

### <span>This is misleading.</span>

The phrase “energy independence” suggests that the United States does
not depend on energy imports, but the United States still relies
significantly on imports of oil and natural gas.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

It is false to suggest that Mr. Biden would “end fracking.” Mr. Biden’s
climate change plan would end new leases for hydraulic fracturing or
fracking, for oil and gas on federal lands, but does not ban existing
fracking on public lands or new or existing fracking on private land.

It is accurate that Mr. Biden is likely to reinstate many of the
Obama-era climate change regulations that were rolled back or weakened
by the Trump administration, including rules reining in greenhouse
pollution from coal-fired power plants and vehicles. At the time those
rules were put forth, the federal government’s cost-benefit analyses
concluded that they would have a net benefit on the economy, but studies
have also shown that they could disproportionately affect some regions
and sectors, particularly coal mining.

### <span>This is mostly true.</span>

Mr. Pence is right that the economy has gained back 9.3 million jobs
through July. It is important to note that is only about 40 percent of
the more than 22 million lost between February and April, though the
rebound has actually marked a faster snapback than what many economists
and analysts anticipated. It is probably unreasonable to pin those job
gains squarely on Mr. Trump’s pre-pandemic policies: Many factors,
including the government’s small business loans and broader pandemic
relief package, have helped the labor market to
recover.

</div>

— Vice President Mike Pence

### <span>Mostly True.</span>

The race to develop a vaccine is well underway, but it is uncertain
whether it will produce results by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony S.
Fauci, an infectious disease expert and a member of the White House
coronavirus task force, has repeatedly said it will likely be the end of
2020 or the start of 2021 before it is clear whether clinical trials
were successful. Some researchers working on vaccine candidates have
said getting data this year will be a real feat.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

Mr. Trump has been pushing hard for a faster timetable. According to two
people with knowledge of the discussion, Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin, who sits on the coronavirus task force, suggested in a July 30
meeting with congressional leaders that the administration would likely
grant emergency authorization for a vaccine before the end of phase
three clinical trials in the United States.

Asked about that remark, a Treasury Department spokesman said that Mr.
Mnuchin believes vaccine approval is wholly up to the Food and Drug
Administration. Nonetheless, the promotion of overly optimistic
scenarios by Mr. Trump and his aides has fostered deep concern that the
White House will try to influence the vaccine approval process for
political reasons.

And a vaccine approval is also only the first step. Even a safe,
effective vaccine is useless unless it can be administered widely, and
experts have begun to worry that many Americans will be unwilling to
take the vaccine, or be unable to access it. A greenlit vaccine also
won’t necessarily make people impervious to infection or even mild
disease, which means that masking and distancing will likely need to
continue for some time yet.

high-performing public charter schools.

The Trump administration has in fact not succeeded in implementing its
voucher programs because they have been blocked by
Congress.

### <span>Mostly true.</span>

The Food and Drug Administration on Sunday issued emergency use
authorization that will expand the use of antibody-rich blood plasma to
treat coronavirus patients. The decision will broaden use of a treatment
that has already been administered to more than 70,000 patients.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

The data suggests that the treatment is most likely to benefit patients
less than 80 years old who receive plasma with a high level of
virus-fighting antibodies within three days of diagnosis. But the extent
of the benefits was exaggerated during a White House news conference.
Research showed that about seven in 100 patients would survive because
of the plasma treatment — not 35 in 100, as President Trump and other
administration officials said. Dr. Stephen Hahn, who heads the Food and
Drug Administration, later corrected his assertions of the benefits of
the treatment, saying he misspoke.

Some experts have also sounded a note of caution, noting the data is
preliminary and the results need to be verified by randomized clinical
trials.

### <span>**This is false.**</span>

Mr. Biden has not publicly committed to repealing all of the tariffs
that Mr. Trump imposed on more than $360 billion of Chinese products in
the course of the trade war. Mr. Biden actually appears reluctant to
commit either way to fully keeping or eliminating the tariffs, and his
aides have said that he plans to evaluate the tariffs once in office
based on their impact on the American middle class. Earlier this month,
Mr. Biden had [a confusing exchange about the
tariffs](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.yahoo.com%2Fsaid-trumps-ideas-good-one-153901834.html)
with the NPR reporter Lulu Garcia-Navarro. Mr. Biden appeared to respond
“no” when asked if he would keep the tariffs on China. The Trump
campaign [seized on the statement to
say](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.donaldjtrump.com%2Fmedia%2Fjoe-biden-says-hell-surrender-to-china-on-trade-scrap-tariffs-without-any-concessions%2F)
Mr. Biden would “scrap tariffs without any concessions.” But an aide
said that Mr. Biden was actually responding to an earlier assertion by
the reporter, that Mr. Trump’s stance was a “good one, to counter
China’s influence.”

### <span>This is misleading. </span>

Vice President Mike Pence is taking Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s comments out
of context. In [a July
discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEIPXpdeia8), the prominent
liberal activist Ady Barkan asked Mr. Biden whether he would support
redirecting “some of the funding for police into social services, mental
health counseling and affordable housing.”

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

Mr. Biden agreed and listed his proposals to increase funding for mental
health clinics, more federal oversight of police departments, and
restricting military equipment sold to the police.

“But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?” Mr. Barkan
asked.

“Yes, absolutely,” Mr. Biden responded.

The published version of that conversation edited out some of Mr.
Biden’s remarks that made his positions clearer. In the full version,
provided to The Times by the Biden campaign, Mr. Biden emphasized that
his proposals were “not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the
police” and repeated that he believed federal grants to departments
should be “conditioned.”

</div>

— Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence

### <span>**This is misleading.**</span>

When American surveillance aimed at gathering foreign intelligence
information picks up information about an American — either because a
target is speaking with an American, or because foreign targets are
talking to other foreigners about an American — it is routine, for
privacy reasons, to mask that American’s name in intelligence reports.
It is lawful for officials to ask to “unmask” the names when it is
necessary to understand the intelligence report.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

Documents that Mr. Grenell declassified earlier this year show that,
during the presidential transition in 2017, someone in Mr. Biden’s
office requested to know who an American was whose name had been
redacted in an intelligence report. It turned out to be Michael Flynn,
Mr. Trump’s incoming national security adviser.

The request logged under Mr. Biden’s name came on Jan. 12, not “three
weeks before the inauguration” as Mr. Grenell said. And contrary to Mr.
Grenell’s claim that Mr. Biden made this request, it could instead have
been an adviser working in his office, because such requests are logged
in the name of senior officials. Rather than a request to unmask Mr.
Flynn, as Mr. Grenell put it, by definition the request was instead to
learn who the unnamed<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>person
was.

with coronavirus cases in the spring, prompting local leaders to plead
with the federal government for assistance.

President Trump initially expressed skepticism about surging demand for
hospital supplies. In March, for example, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New
York openly called for tens of thousands of ventilators from the federal
government, Mr. Trump [questioned the volume of the
request](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/489789-trump-questions-need-for-30000-ventilators-in-new-york).
Some hospitals resorted to [pairing two patients on one

Mr. Trump did not suspend all travel from China in his Jan. 31

American citizens and permanent residents were allowed to enter the
United States even if they had been in China within 14 days before
arrival. Close family members of American citizens were also allowed to
enter the United States. Moreover, the travel ban had only a limited
effect in stopping or lessening the spread of the novel coronavirus in
the United States. The ban was porous — a New York Times analysis of
data determined that [nearly 40,000
travelers](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F04%2F04%2Fus%2Fcoronavirus-china-travel-restrictions.html)

It is true that women’s unemployment hit the lowest level since roughly

more than 70 percent of jobs added to the economy last year. Ms. Trump
is right that women gained more than 4 million jobs between November

### <span>**This is misleading.**</span>

The Veterans Choice Program was [created

at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. Under the program, veterans
who do not live within 40 miles of a department hospital or face wait
times of more than 30 days for care could seek private health care
funded by the government. In 2018, Mr. Trump signed [a law that
overhauled and
consolidated](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2018%2F05%2F23%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fveterans-health-care.html%3Fmodule%3Dinline)
Veterans Choice and other existing programs into a single Veterans
Community Care Program. Under [new

veterans who must drive for at least 30 minutes to one of the
department’s facilities will be able to opt for private care, a less
stringent requirement for many
veterans.

The day that an accord went into effect in 2016 to limit Iran’s nuclear

Obama administration loaded a plane with [$400
million](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2016%2F08%2F03%2Fpolitics%2Fus-sends-plane-iran-400-million-cash%2Findex.html)
in several currencies as a first installment of money long owed to
Tehran. The money was part of $1.7 billion in assets, including
interest, that the [United States froze after Iran’s revolution
in 1979](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2016%2F08%2F23%2Fopinion%2Fthe-fake-400-million-iran-ransom-story.html)
and that had been intended to pay for military hardware that the former
shah in Tehran had purchased but that was never delivered.

— Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence

### <span>**This is false.**</span>

Richard Grenell is trying to assert that President Trump always shows
support for protests against authoritarian governments. Mr. Trump, who
often [praises
dictators](https://www.defendingdemocracytogether.org/national-security/),
has failed to express support for some of the most prominent such
protests of the last three years. The most notable example is that of
the pro-democracy protests that began in June 2019 in Hong Kong.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

Mr. Trump told Xi Jinping, the leader of China, on a telephone call that
June that he and his aides would [refrain from commenting on the
protests](https://www.ft.com/content/3ef12a1e-a2b8-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d)
if the Chinese government agreed to continue with trade talks, according
to administration officials. John R. Bolton, the former national
security adviser, [wrote in his new
book](https://www.wsj.com/articles/john-bolton-the-scandal-of-trumps-china-policy-11592419564)
that he heard Mr. Trump say of the Hong Kong protests that month: “I
don’t want to get involved,” and, “We have human-rights problems too.”

Mr. Bolton also wrote that Mr. Trump refused to issue a White House
statement on the 30th anniversary of the Chinese military’s massacre of
pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square.

“Who cares about it?” Mr. Trump said. “I’m trying to make a deal.”

Mr. Trump has made a few comments on the protests in Belarus, where
demonstrators say Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader,
subverted a presidential election this month. But Mr. Trump did [express
support](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/11/trump-iran-protesters-tweets-097554)
on Twitter in January for anti-government protests in Iran. The message
appeared on his account in
[English](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1216114135529902081)
and
[Persian](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1216114167108849665).

— Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law

### <span>**This is misleading**.</span>

While some progressive Democrats do want to “defund the police,” Mr.
Biden is not among them. Since the police killing of George Floyd on
Memorial Day, Mr. Biden has made calls for systemic changes to the
country’s criminal justice system and proposed changes to police
tactics. But he has said he opposes cutting resources for law
enforcement — rather, he has [proposed new funding for community
policing](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F06%2F26%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fdefund-police-protests-democrats.html),
which a spokesman said would be conditioned on departments implementing
reforms. He reinforced this sentiment on the [opening
night](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F08%2F19%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fdemocrats-biden-defund-police.html)
of the Democratic National Convention, taking pains to set himself apart
from the left wing of his party. “Most cops are good,” Mr. Biden said
then, “but the fact is, the bad ones need to be identified and
prosecuted.”

</div>

— Richard Grenell, former acting director of national intelligence

### <span>**This is misleading.**</span>

Mr. Trump and his supporters — like Mr. Grenell, who Mr. Trump installed
as the nation’s top intelligence official from February to May without
Senate confirmation to be in that role — have sought to portray him as a
victim of the counterintelligence investigation the F.B.I. opened in
July 2016 into Russia’s covert operation to tilt the election in his
favor.

<div class="css-1dv1kvn">

The investigation included an attempt to figure out whether anyone
associated with the Trump campaign cooperated with that effort,
wittingly or otherwise. In the course of that inquiry, the F.B.I. used
several confidential human informants to approach Trump campaign
associates to see what they would say about any advance knowledge of
Russia’s hacking and release of Democratic emails. It also wiretapped
Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser with many ties to Russian
intelligence officials; by the time the F.B.I. applied for that warrant,
the election was nearly over and Mr. Page had already left the Trump
campaign, although wiretap orders permit the F.B.I. to look at any older
emails in a target’s account.

The purpose of this investigation was to understand the scope and nature
of an effort by a foreign adversary to manipulate an American election.
Calling it a “surveillance operation on the Trump campaign” connotes
trying to gain an electoral advantage, but there is no evidence that any
information gathered by the inquiry was provided to the Clinton campaign
or leaked to affect the vote. Moreover, saying it was launched by the
Obama-Biden administration suggests political appointees launched it,
but the investigation was opened by career law enforcement officials and
continued under the Trump administration.
