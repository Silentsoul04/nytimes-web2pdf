Addressing a maskless crowd of supporters seated close together on the
South Lawn of the White House, President Trump on Thursday night
accepted his party’s presidential nomination, telling his supporters
that all of his achievements were “now in danger” because of the looming
threat of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

In a long address that sounded in tone and delivery much like his State
of the Union addresses, Mr. Trump ticked back and forth between touting
his own achievements and maligning his opponent, relying on misleading
claims to do both.

“We’re here and they’re not,” he said at one point, referencing the
White House behind him, even though he has been widely criticized for
using holding a partisan event on government property.

Mr. Trump began his remarks with an acknowledgment of “the wonderful
people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura,” but
notably made no mention of the 180,000 American lives lost to the
coronavirus pandemic until much later in his address, when he used a
racist term to refer to the virus and called the deaths it had caused
“so unnecessary.”

He quickly diverged from the positive, optimistic vision that the
convention planners had sought to project all week as he launched a
direct attack on Mr. Biden and a defense of his own record.

“Everything we’ve achieved is now in danger,” he said. “This election
will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or allow a
radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it.”

While Mr. Biden did not mention Mr. Trump by name in his nominating
speech, Mr. Trump spoke directly about Mr. Biden in his, casting his
opponent in dark and misleading terms.

“Joe Biden is not the savior of America’s soul,” he said. “He is the
destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the
destroyer of America’s greatness.”

Ignoring his own troubled history of [bragging about sexual
misconduct](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html?module=inline)
and the allegations of sexual assault against him, Mr. Trump made a dig
referring to Mr. Biden’s handsy approach to politicking, [which came
under scrutiny last
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/02/us/politics/joe-biden-women-me-too.html).

The president claimed that during Mr. Biden’s career in public office,
the former vice president “took the donations of blue-collar workers,
gave them hugs, and even kisses.”

Mr. Trump paused for the audience to chuckle at the reference.

During a speech read from a teleprompter, with little of the
free-wheeling, stream of consciousness style typically associated with
Mr. Trump’s public remarks, he made little mention of the distress that
has swept the country in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd
and Breonna Taylor and the more recent shooting of Jacob Blake, focusing
instead on what he called the “anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters
and flag-burners.”

And he tried to portray himself as the candidate whose policies are
backed by science and designed for the working people of America. The
president’s advisers have been trying to frame the potential for another
widespread lockdown as something that only the upper middle class and
coastal elites who can work from home would be able to handle, which Mr.
Trump alluded to as he brought up Mr. Biden’s remark that he would be
willing to shut down the country again if
necessary.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

“The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug
overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks,
economic devastation, job loss, into much more,” he said. “Joe Biden’s
plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it is a surrender to the
virus.”

He claimed that he was basing his response on “the science, the facts,
and the data,” even though the number of positive cases has risen where
schools and businesses have reopened.

Mr. Trump also claimed that Mr. Biden, a moderate Democrat, was a pawn
of the left, who would “demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and
appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other
Constitutional freedoms.”

Mr. Trump for the most part stuck to his prepared remarks. He did at one
point ad-lib a line about the baseless theory he has been promoting for
years — that President Barack Obama had spied on his campaign. “Remember
this,” He said. “They spied on my campaign and they got caught. Let’s
see now what happens.”

Mr. Trump’s address ended with fireworks just before midnight at the
Washington Monument, another use of federal property for political
purposes.

He called it “the People’s House.”

But on Thursday night, as President Trump accepted his party’s
renomination in an overtly political event staged on the South Lawn of
the White House, he turned the majestic building into a partisan prop
like no politician has ever done before.

Capping a week in which Mr. Trump and his Republican allies repeatedly
ignored rules that are supposed to enforce the line between politics and
policy, the president stood grandly in front of the country’s most
important landmark to denounce his rival.

“At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly
assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice,”
Mr. Trump said to an audience of more than 1,500 as American flags waved
behind him. “So tonight, I ask you a simple question: How can the
Democratic Party lead our country when it spends so much time tearing
down our country?”

Previous presidents have sought to carefully navigate the propriety of
mixing campaigning with governing, even though the laws that attempt to
minimize their collision do not apply to the occupant of the Oval
Office.

Jimmy Carter announced his re-election bid in the East Room and Ronald
Reagan did so from the Oval Office. But neither had live crowds flanked
by giant Jumbotrons on either side of the White House, serving as
immense campaign billboards.

Mr. Trump appeared to recognize the power of the setting. At the
beginning of his speech, he noted that the White House “has been the
home of larger than life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew
Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter
future.”

Motioning to the grand building behind him, Mr. Trump said that “within
these walls lived tenacious generals, like Presidents Grant and
Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these
grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition.”

But if the president was aware of the building’s storied history, he
showed no embarrassment at the prospect of putting it to use as the
backdrop for fierce partisan attacks.

“We have spent the last four years, reversing the damage Joe Biden
inflicted over the last 47 years,” Mr. Trump said. “Biden’s record is a
shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in
our lifetime.”

Mr. Trump’s campaign spared no expense in creating that backdrop —
building an extensive, red-white-and-blue stage where Marine One usually
takes off, installing 1,500 folding chairs, and a lectern with the seal
of the President of the United States.

Mr. Trump milked it for all it was worth, walking down from the home’s
south balcony to begin his speech.

“My fellow Americans,” he said moments later, the White House lit up
brightly behind him, “tonight with a heart of gratitude and boundless
optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for president of the
United States.”

Later, as he called for evicting the “failed political class” from
Washington, Mr. Trump turned back toward the White House.

“The fact is, I’m here,” he said, a broad smile across his face. “What’s
the name of that building?” he asked as the crowd cheered. Turning back
to the crowd, he was even more blunt: “But I’ll say it differently. The
fact is we’re here, and they’re not.”

And he punctuated his use of Washington’s public spaces with a
thunderous fireworks display over the Washington Monument and the
Lincoln Memorial — all in service of his campaign.

Spelled out in the sky: “TRUMP” and “2020.”

## [Trump made numerous false claims. Read our fact check.](#trump-made-numerous-false-claims-read-our-fact-check)

</div>

In his address on Thursday, President Trump made a number of false or
misleading claims. Here are a few of them, and [read our full fact check
here](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-fact-check).

[*“We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our
front line health care
workers.”*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-fact-check#we-shipped-hundreds-of-millions-of-masks-gloves-and-gowns-to-our-front-line-health-care-workers)

**This is misleading.**

A [report by the inspector
general](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Foig.hhs.gov%2Foei%2Freports%2Foei-06-20-00300.pdf)
of the Department of Health and Human Services in the early days of the
pandemic found serious problems with the supplies shipped from the
strategic national stockpile. **“**Some hospitals noted that at the time
of our interview they had not received supplies from the Strategic
National Stockpile, or that the supplies that they had received were not
sufficient in quantity or quality,” the inspector general wrote. One
administrator stated that getting supplies from the stockpile was a
major challenge, saying that the supplies the hospital received “won’t
even last a day. We need gloves, we need masks with fluid shields on —
N95 masks — and we need gowns.”

-----

[*“Days after taking office, we … ended the unfair and very costly Paris
climate accord and secured for the first time American energy
independence.”*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-fact-check#days-after-taking-office-we-ended-the-unfair-and-very-costly-paris-climate-accord-and-secured-for-the-first-time-american-energy)

**False.**

While President Trump did withdraw the United States from the Paris
climate change agreement — [a move that was not legally initiated
until 2019](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/23/climate/trump-paris-climate-accord.html)
— the pact, which includes nearly every other nation on earth, remains
intact without the participation of the United States.

It is not accurate to say that the United States is “energy
independent,” a phrase that suggests that the United States is
independent of reliance on imported energy sources. In 2019, nearly half
the oil consumed by the United States was imported — [about 9 million
barrels per
day](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&t=6#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20United%20States,\(including%20ethanol%20and%20biodiesel\).)
were imported of the roughly 20 million barrels per day that were
consumed, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
statistical arm of the Energy Department.

-----

[*“I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American
community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican
president.”*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-fact-check#i-say-very-modestly-that-i-have-done-more-for-the-african-american-community-than-any-president-since-abraham-lincoln-our-first-)

**False.**

[Not according to
historians](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/05/us/politics/trump-black-african-americans-fact-check.html).
Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant
legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who
shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act
and the Fair Housing Act.

A 2017 study that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of
editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top.
Mr. Trump would place in the bottom third, the study’s co-author told
the Times.

-----

[*“We are delivering lifesaving therapies and will produce a vaccine
before the end of the year or maybe even
sooner.”*](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-fact-check#we-are-delivering-lifesaving-therapies-and-will-produce-a-vaccine-before-the-end-of-the-year-or-maybe-even-sooner)

**Exaggerated.**

The race to develop a vaccine is well underway, but it is uncertain
whether it will produce results by the end of the year. Dr. Anthony
Fauci, an infectious disease expert and a member of the coronavirus task
force, has repeatedly said it will likely be the end of 2020 or the
start of 2021 before it is clear whether clinical trials were
successful. Some researchers working on vaccine candidates have said
getting data this year will be a real feat.

Mr. Trump has been pushing hard for a faster timetable. According to two
people with knowledge of the discussion, Treasury Secretary Mark
Mnuchin, who sits on the coronavirus task force, suggested in a July 30
meeting with congressional leaders that the administration would likely
grant emergency authorization for a vaccine before the end of phase
three clinical trials in the United States. Asked about that remark, a
Treasury Department spokesperson said that Mr. Mnuchin believes vaccine
approval is wholly up to the Food and Drug Administration. Nonetheless,
the promotion of overly optimistic scenarios by Mr. Trump and his aides
has fostered deep concern that the White House will try to influence the
vaccine approval process for political reasons.

that has claimed the lives of [more than 180,000
people](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)
in the United States, repeatedly misstating the truth about his
administration’s response to the worst health crisis in a century.

Speaking in front of a large audience — few of whom were wearing masks
as they sat within inches of one another — Mr. Trump said that “to save
as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and
the data.”

In fact, the president’s administration failed to prevent the spread of
the virus in the early days of the crisis as Mr. Trump himself
downplayed its threat and mocked recommendations from scientists to
increase testing and wear masks.

In his remarks on the last night of the Republican convention, Mr. Trump
ignored those facts. Instead, he repeated misleading claims about the
steps that his government took to confront the consequences of the
virus.

“[We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our
frontline health care
workers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-fact-check?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage#we-shipped-hundreds-of-millions-of-masks-gloves-and-gowns-to-our-front-line-health-care-workers),”
Mr. Trump said. But a [report by the inspector
general](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Foig.hhs.gov%2Foei%2Freports%2Foei-06-20-00300.pdf)
of the Department of Health and Human Services in the early days of the
coronavirus crisis found serious problems with the supplies shipped from
the strategic national stockpile.

Mr. Trump also claimed that the administration was “[delivering
lifesaving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the
year or maybe even
sooner.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-fact-check?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage#we-are-delivering-lifesaving-therapies-and-will-produce-a-vaccine-before-the-end-of-the-year-or-maybe-even-sooner)

Medical experts have said that it is still uncertain whether the race to
develop a vaccine will lead to one by the end of the year, much less any
sooner. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the coronavirus task force, has
repeatedly said it will most likely be the end of 2020 or the start of
2021 before it is clear whether clinical trials were successful.

Mr. Trump also used his speech to attack former Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr. for his plan to confront the virus if he becomes president.

“Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender
to the virus,” he said.

During and after Mr. Trump’s speech, protesters in Washington
demonstrated against, among other things, his handling of the
pandemic.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

## [Republican convention speakers quoted Trump saying things that don’t sound like anything he’s ever said in public.](#republican-convention-speakers-quoted-trump-saying-things-that-dont-sound-like-anything-hes-ever-said-in-public)

</div>

All week, speakers at the Republican National Convention have
implausibly described President Trump as a caring, empathic leader who
doesn’t hesitate to give his time to those in need.

But a handful of Mr. Trump’s hagiographers went even further than that —
ascribing direct quotations to the president that do not track with any
public statements he has made.

While there is ample reporting to suggest Mr. Trump has little patience
for death — [he began his father’s eulogy by speaking about
himself](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/28/us/politics/donald-fred-trump.html)
— Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio said Mr. Trump found [a reservoir of
empathy](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/24/us/rnc-convention-election/jim-jordan-sought-to-paint-trump-as-empathetic-with-a-personal-story)
for the parents of Mr. Jordan’s nephew, who had been killed in a car
accident.

“The president,” Mr. Jordan said, “said, ‘Yeah, losing a loved one’s
always difficult, and it’s really tough when they’re so young.’”

Kellyanne Conway, [the departing White
House](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/26/us/rnc-convention-election/kellyanne-conway-is-leaving-the-white-house-but-not-the-spotlight)
counselor who served as a campaign manager for Mr. Trump in 2016,
recounted a conversation in which Mr. Trump described drug overdoses as
a “personal” responsibility.

She recalled: “When President Trump asked me to coordinate the White
House efforts on combating the drug crisis, he said: ‘This is personal,
Kellyanne. So many lives have been ruined by addiction and we’ll never
even know it because people are ashamed to reach out for help, or
they’re not sure who to turn to in their toughest hour.’”

Perhaps no story was as implausible as the [one relayed by Richard
Grenell](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/26/us/rnc-convention-election/richard-grenell-a-former-diplomat-and-intelligence-official-revives-an-unsubstantiated-wiretap-claim),
the former United States ambassador to Germany, who said, “I’ve watched
President Trump charm the chancellor of Germany” — an anecdote [hardly
supported](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/27/us/politics/trump-merkel.html)
by reporting or photo evidence of their meetings.

[Ben Carson, Mr. Trump’s housing
secretary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-convention-election/ben-carson-the-lone-black-person-in-trumps-cabinet-offers-consolation-to-jacob-blakes-family),
said that the president, who has often demeaned Americans who live in
cities and states governed by Democrats, “wants everyone to succeed and
believes in the adage, ‘a rising tide lifts all boats.’”

But no convention speaker took as much creative license with quotations
from Mr. Trump as [his own daughter, Ivanka
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/27/us/rnc-convention-election/ivanka-trump-introducing-her-father-tries-to-humanize-him).
During her remarks introducing her father, she recalled watching on
television as Alice Johnson was released from prison after he commuted
her sentence.

“After a long silence, he looked at me and said, ‘Imagine how many
people there are just like Alice,’” Ms. Trump said. “From that point on,
he became a voice for those who had been unfairly silenced in our prison
system.”

(Later in the evening, Mr. Trump highlighted his executive order
demanding 10-year prison sentences for anyone convicted of tearing down
historical statues and monuments, including those built to glorify
Confederates.)

Ms. Trump also said the president was amused by television advertising
attacking him — a proposition easily disproved by reading his Twitter
feed.

“When we see attack ads paid for by big pharma, my dad smiles and says,
‘To me, you know, we are doing something really right if they are
hitting us so hard,’” she said.

For all of these efforts to soften the president’s image and point to
his compassion in private situations, when it came time for Mr. Trump to
speak, he dismissed it as unimportant.

“The laid-off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and
many other states didn’t want Joe Biden’s hollow words of empathy,” he
said. “They wanted their jobs back.”

Ivanka Trump introduced President Trump to accept his nomination,
calling herself “the proud daughter of the people’s president,” seeking
to humanize her father with stories about his grandchildren and praise
for his agenda on behalf of Americans.

More than just Mr. Trump’s elder daughter, Ms. Trump is a senior adviser
in the White House, the wife of another top aide, and a powerful — if
quiet — voice in the president’s tightest circle of confidants.

Describing her father as someone with “strong convictions,” Ms. Trump
conceded that “my dad’s communication style is not to everyone’s taste.”
She added that the president’s tweets “can feel a bit unfiltered.”

“But,” she said, speaking live from the South Lawn of the White House,
with American flags waving behind her, “the results speak for
themselves.”

Publicly, Ms. Trump has pushed an agenda that focused on expanding the
child tax credit and increasing paid family leave for workers, though
critics say her efforts have largely benefited well-to-do families
rather than the working poor who struggle with child care.

In her remarks, she stressed what she said was her father’s empathy for
workers and others — an assertion made by many convention speakers this
week that has repeatedly been challenged by the president’s public
behavior.

“I’ve been with my father and seen the pain in his eyes when he receives
updates on the lives that have been stolen by this plague,” she said,
referring to the coronavirus pandemic. “I have witnessed him make some
of the most difficult decisions of his life.”

Despite the division that Mr. Trump has sown over four years, his
daughter described him as a uniter, noting his efforts to pass a
bipartisan overhaul of the criminal justice system.

“My father did not campaign on this issue. He tackled this injustice
because he has a deep compassion for those who have been treated
unfairly,” she said. “More than rhetoric and political prose, the
ability to build consensus and achieve bipartisan success like this will
help heal our country’s racial inequities and bring us forward —
together.”

Ms. Trump received a standing ovation from the crowd of about 2,000
people when she said her father made [a peace agreement in the Middle
East](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/15/world/middleeast/israel-uae-netanyahu-arabs.html)
between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, calling it “the biggest
breakthrough in a quarter-century.”

Privately, Ms. Trump has sometimes clashed with her father, giving hope
to the president’s critics that she might be able to hold back his worst
impulses. On that score, the record is mixed.

Despite urging Mr. Trump not to abandon the Paris climate accord, the
president did just that, accusing the agreement of imposing [“draconian
financial and economic
burdens”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord/)
on the country. But she succeeded in helping to persuade Mr. Trump to
abandon the policy of separating migrant families at the border after
cries of outrage from around the globe.

But on Thursday, Ms. Trump did not mention either of those issues.
Instead, she emphasized her support for her father and his priorities.

“Dad, people attack you for being unconventional, but I love you for
being real, and I respect you for being effective,” she said.

Ms. Trump’s profile is even higher abroad than it is at home, a fact
that has sometimes attracted scorn because of her perceived lack of
experience and formal position in the government. At an economic
conference in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Ms. Trump [participated in
a bilateral
meeting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/22/world/europe/ivanka-trump-davos.html)
with the prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, and hosted a breakfast
for corporate titans.

Ms. Trump has drawn criticism from ethics experts despite having shut
down her branded line of clothing in the summer of 2018. Recently, she
endorsed Goya beans [in a picture on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/1283221019684110337)
after the company had became the target of a boycott following its
leader’s praise for the president during a visit to the White House.
Experts called it an illegal abuse of her position for the benefit of a
private company.

Earlier, she [drew
criticism](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/15/us/politics/coronavirus-ivanka-trump.html)
for traveling to her family’s New Jersey estate for Passover in April
despite travel restrictions that were in place because of the
[coronavirus

Melania Trump, appearing alongside President Trump on the last night of
the Republican convention, fell victim to one of the classic
photographic blunders.

The most famous is “never hold up a whiteboard,” but only slightly less
well-known is this: Never wear lime green.

As TV broadcasters and Photoshop aficionados know, doing so provides a
ready-made green screen on which anyone can overlay, well, anything.
Predictably, the memes started appearing within half an hour of Mrs.
Trump’s emergence from the White House in a green dress.

Among the images placed on Mrs. Trump’s dress were the numbers of

Alice Marie Johnson was serving a life sentence in an Alabama prison for
a nonviolent drug conviction when Kim Kardashian West discovered her
story on social media and personally appealed on her behalf to President
Trump.

Mr. Trump liked Ms. West, and he liked Ms. Johnson’s story, of someone
who became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an
ordained minister behind bars. He [commuted her sentence
in 2018](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/06/06/us/politics/trump-alice-johnson-sentence-commuted-kim-kardashian-west.html),
after she spent nearly 22 years in prison.

Since then, Ms. Johnson has become the administration’s preferred poster
child (or poster grandmother) for criminal justice reform, and her
inclusion at this year’s Republican convention was no surprise.

Ms. Johnson’s story was featured in the Trump campaign’s
[multimillion-dollar Super Bowl
ad](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/04/us/politics/trump-super-bowl-ad.html),
designed to appeal to Black voters, or at least make them feel that
there was an option to vote for on the Republican side of the aisle. She
appeared this year as a speaker at the Conservative Political Action
Conference, where she told her inspiring personal story and credited Mr.
Trump for her freedom.

Her voting rights have not been restored and she will not be able to
cast her ballot for Mr. Trump.

But she is valuable to the Trump White House because she is a person of
color telling a heartfelt, personal story about how the president’s
policies brought her justice.

On Thursday night, she said that Mr. Trump’s decision to sign into law
the First Step Act, which modified federal sentencing laws and took
steps to reduce recidivism, “brought joy, hope, and freedom to thousands
of well-deserving people. I hollered ‘hallelujah\!’ My faith in justice
and mercy was rewarded.”

She said that when Mr. Trump heard her story, “he saw me as a person. He
had compassion. And he acted.”

Ms. Johnson has tried to use her platform and unique access to the Trump
White House, as well, to fight for justice for women she was close with
when serving in prison. The three African-American women [whose
commutations the White House announced in
February](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/18/us/politics/trump-pardons.html)
were all people whom Ms. Johnson served time with, knows intimately and
had recommended for clemency.

a Black father in Wisconsin who was partly paralyzed after a white
officer fired at him in front of his children, reignited [protests
against racism and police
violence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles)
in the nation’s capital on Thursday, not long before President Trump was
expected to address the Republican National Convention from the White
House, just yards away.

Fred Nelson, 54, a retired police officer, said he was attending the
demonstration for his Black sons. Even as more and more Black people
were killed at the hands of the police this summer, nothing had seemed
to change, he said, a common frustration among the protesters.

“Enough is enough,” he said. “Every week is a different incident.
Something has to be done. If not now, when?”

Sydney Williams, 28, had been to similar protests nearly every week
since May. But the news coverage had disappeared, she said, adding that
maybe protesters needed to “step on Congress’s neck” to get something
done.

Nearby, several Latino advocacy groups projected some of Mr. Trump’s
remarks about undocumented immigrants onto the Newseum, including:
“These aren’t people. These are animals.”

Later in the evening, the demonstration evolved from what was a standoff
between the police and protesters into a de facto block party along
Black Lives Matter Plaza. Some danced to music played by D.J.s, and a
drumming troupe performed for the crowd.

Protesters in Washington joined others across the country who have
denounced the shooting of Mr. Blake in Kenosha, Wis.

The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the episode.

Thousands are expected to congregate in the nation’s capital on Friday
to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and to
protest police brutality. The families of [George

Carl and Marsha Mueller, whose daughter was kidnapped and killed by
Islamic State militants, said they believed she would have been rescued
if President Trump had been in office at the time.

Their daughter, Kayla, a 26-year-old humanitarian worker, was kidnapped
shortly after entering Syria in 2013, held hostage and repeatedly raped.

“For 18 months, she endured, and we endured an agonizing back-and-forth
between us, the Obama administration and ISIS,” Mr. Mueller said. “We
put all our faith in the government. But the government let us down.
President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded
other Americans. To this day, we’ve never heard from Joe Biden.”

He added: “The military prepared a rescue mission, but the White House
delayed it. By the time it went forward, Kayla had been moved to another
location.”

Kayla Mueller’s death [was
confirmed](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/02/11/world/middleeast/parents-of-kayla-mueller-isis-hostage-confirm-she-is-dead.html)
in February 2015. The Islamic State [claimed at the
time](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/02/07/world/middleeast/isis-claims-american-hostage-killed-by-jordanian-retaliation-bombings.html)
that she had died in a Jordanian airstrike, but more recent evidence
indicates that the group’s leader at the time, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,
[may have ordered her
killing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/11/12/us/politics/kayla-mueller-baghdadi.html).

Mr. al-Baghdadi [died in
October](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/27/world/middleeast/al-baghdadi-dead.html)
during a United States Special Operations raid named after Kayla.

Ms. Mueller read excerpts from a letter that another hostage smuggled
out, in which Kayla wrote, “Know I am also fighting from my side in the
ways I am able, and I have a lot of fight left inside of me.”

Marsha Mueller added that she and her husband supported Mr. Trump
“because of his commitment to make and keep America great, not with
the power of the government, but with the passion of people like Kayla —
Americans who, even in the darkest days, always have more fight left
inside of them.”

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The Arkansas senator exaggerated
parts of Joe Biden’s record as vice president in his remarks to the
Republican National Convention, and painted President Trump as a strong
negotiator with foreign
powers.</span>](https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/27/us/elections/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10-cotton/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png)

Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas on Thursday delivered a searing critique
of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s foreign policy, warning
in a speech at the Republican National Convention that electing Mr.
Biden as president would “return us to a weak and dangerous past.”

One of the most conservative Republicans since arriving in the Senate
five years ago, Mr. Cotton has become a Trump whisperer on key subjects,
urging the president to be more aggressive against China, immigrants and
protesters.

In his remarks, Mr. Cotton exaggerated the facts about Mr. Biden’s
record, claiming that the former vice president “let ISIS terrorists
rampage across the Middle East” and “treated Israel like a nuisance.” In
fact, the Obama-Biden administration waged a fierce campaign against the
Islamic State and engaged repeatedly with Israel’s government.

A former Army infantry officer, Mr. Cotton’s hawkish views about the use
of force abroad have sometimes clashed with those of Mr. Trump, who has
said he wants to pull back American troops from what he calls misguided
overseas adventures.

But Mr. Cotton has Mr. Trump’s ear when it comes to his desire to cut
legal immigration. In the summer of 2017, Mr. Cotton persuaded the
president to endorse his Raise Act, a Senate bill that would have
reduced the flow of legal immigration into the United States by half.

When the president appeared to be on the brink of a deal in 2018 with
Democrats to legalize young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers,
it was Mr. Cotton who rushed with other conservative allies to the Oval
Office to talk him out of it.

A fierce critic of China, Mr. Cotton has been relentless in pushing Mr.
Trump to blame that country’s Communist leadership for the coronavirus.
Mr. Trump’s decision to [leave the World Health
Organization](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/07/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-who.html)
came after intense lobbying from Mr. Cotton about the agency’s deference
to the Chinese leadership.

On Thursday, Mr. Cotton lashed out at Mr. Biden for, he said, having
“aided and abetted China’s rise for 50 years with terrible trade deals
that closed our factories and laid off our workers.”

He did not offer specifics, but boasted that Mr. Trump “stands up to
China’s cheating and stealing and lying.” He insisted that Mr. Biden
would be weak in the face of China and other adversaries, while Mr.
Trump has not.

“We need a president who stands up for America — not one who takes a
knee,” Mr. Cotton said, a reference to athletes who have protested
against racial injustice.

When pockets of violence broke out in several American cities amid the
largely peaceful protests that took place after the killing of George
Floyd by the Minneapolis police, Mr. Cotton was vocal in urging the
president to take aggressive action to impose order.

In June, The New York Times published an Op-Ed article by Mr. Cotton in
which he described an “orgy of violence” after the killing of Mr. Floyd
and called for the president to “employ the military” to stop looting
during protests. The
[essay](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html)
was titled “Send In the Troops.”

After many of The Times’s readers and employees objected, noting that
Mr. Cotton’s article contained falsehoods and saying it had put Black
people, including Times staff members, in danger, the newspaper
concluded that “the essay fell short of our standards and should not
have been published.”

## [‘I think it’s pretty boring when you do tapes,’ Trump said, before his almost entirely pretaped convention.](#i-think-its-pretty-boring-when-you-do-tapes-trump-said-before-his-almost-entirely-pretaped-convention)

</div>

After taking in a week’s worth of Democratic convention programming,
President Trump saw room for improvement, simply on a production level.

“We’re going to have more of it live than what they did,” Mr. Trump told
Fox News last week. “I think it’s pretty boring when you do tapes.”

In fact, the vast, vast majority of Mr. Trump’s convention — which aides
promised would be more of a traditional “live” event — has been taped
hours before broadcast. Most of the speeches from Trump family members,
White House officials and elected officials in the Mellon Auditorium in
Washington, D.C., were taped ahead of time.

On Thursday, almost the entire program was on tape, save for appearances
by Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban Development, and the
president’s daughter Ivanka. Mr. Trump’s speech was also set to be
delivered live.

The Trump campaign asked most of its speakers to pretape their remarks
on a patriotic set inside the Mellon Auditorium, lending the illusion of
a live event — no domestic Zoom backdrops here. But this was almost as
much of a virtual convention as the Democrats’.

The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, for instance, watched
her own appearance at the convention from her office in the West Wing,
surrounded by her staff. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City
mayor whose speech played on Thursday, was seated on the South Lawn as
part of the convention audience, ahead of Mr. Trump’s own speech.

The reliance on tape was only surprising because Mr. Trump claimed he
was going to do it live. Television producers rely on pretape because it
minimizes risk and makes for a smoother viewing experience without gaps
and hiccups.

## [Republicans mount an all-out assault against a familiar enemy: New York City.](#republicans-mount-an-all-out-assault-against-a-familiar-enemy-new-york-city)

</div>

For the first half of the final night of the Republican National
Convention, you could be forgiven for thinking the Democratic
presidential nominee was New York City itself.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor, attacked the city. Patrick
Lynch, the president of the city’s police union, ticked through a list
of local people killed by gun violence. There was a video montage
attacking, for some reason, Mayor Bill de Blasio (who, it should be
noted, did briefly run for president himself last year).

And Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, in his very brief
testimonial, proudly noted that he was the only leader in Washington not
from New York or California.

All this for the city that launched President Trump’s career in real
estate, the media and eventually politics.

It’s hard to imagine a Democratic convention spending an evening firing
a series of attacks against a heavily Republican state like Oklahoma or
Idaho. But Republicans don’t think twice about painting New York or San
Francisco as political boogeymen, places to hold up as examples of what
the rest of the country wants to avoid.

Much of this is simply Republicans engaging in the very identity
politics they claim to abhor. New York City is full of Black and
Hispanic people, and millions of immigrants — the sort of people
Republicans have long used to scare up votes in white America long
before Mr. Trump’s rise.

Now that they have a president eager and willing to tar American cities
because they are governed by Democrats, there is very little subtlety to
their attacks on New York City.

mayor of New York and a personal lawyer to the president, made dubious
claims about crime in Democrat-led
cities.</span>](https://static01.graylady3jvrrxbe.onion/images/2020/08/27/us/elections/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png)

Four years ago at the Republican National Convention, Rudolph W.
Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, played the role that Kimberly
Guilfoyle took on this year — acting as the speaker who delivered a
speech at the highest decibel.

Standing on the stage in Cleveland, fists clenched, arms open, Mr.
Giuliani shouted a fear-stoking message to viewers that the world was
full of threats and terror.

“The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe,” he said then.
“They fear for their children and they fear for themselves. They fear
for our police officers who are being targeted.”

On Thursday night, Mr. Giuliani came for a reprise, and a return to his
roots in law and order, rather than speaking as the person who has
recently tried to dig up dirt abroad about former Vice President Joseph
R. Biden, Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee.

He described New York City, the city he once led, as a place “in shock,"
and blamed its Democratic mayor, Bill de Blasio.

“Murders, shootings and violent crime are increasing at percentages
unheard of in the past,” he said, inaccurately. “We are seeing the
return of rioting and looting.”

He claimed, falsely, that New York was overwhelmed by crime.

He urged viewers, “Don’t let Democrats do to America what they have done
to New York\!”

He credited Mr. Trump for condemning the senseless killing of George
Floyd by the police. But he claimed the left had decided to protest
because it had, in his words, “a president to beat and a country to
destroy.”

“They hijacked the peaceful protests” and turned them into “vicious
riots,” he said. In reality, violent demonstrators and looters
represented only a small fraction of the protesters who have gathered
across the country this summer.

Mr. Giuliani has, in his most recent iteration, been at the center of
the efforts to dig up dirt and any possible conflicts of interest
involving Hunter Biden, the son of Mr. Biden, specifically in Ukraine,
in order to portray the Democratic nominee as corrupt. The effort by Mr.
Trump and his allies to find damaging information about Mr. Trump’s
political rivals formed the basis of the inquiry that led to Mr. Trump’s
impeachment.

But Mr. Giuliani notably did not mention Hunter Biden at all during his
speech.

Attaching himself to Mr. Trump [gave Mr. Giuliani a second shot at
relevance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/politics/trump-washington-giuliani.html)
four years ago, and that has not abated in the past four years. Many
White House officials would prefer this weren’t the case.

After joining Mr. Trump’s legal team as his personal lawyer during the
special counsel’s investigation, Mr. Giuliani’s television appearances
often appeared to simply ignite new questions about abuse of power by a
president coercing a foreign leader to investigate a political rival.

But Mr. Trump always defended him, even when Mr. Giuliani was [under
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/11/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-investigation.html)
by federal prosecutors for his dealings in Ukraine, as “a great crime
fighter.”

Patrick Lynch, the head of New York City’s conservative police union,
who[fiercely defended the officers responsible for the chokehold killing
of Eric Garner
in 2014](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-union-suggests-work-slowdown-after-nypd-officer-fired-eric-n1044486),
offered a blistering defense of law enforcement that conjured
bad-old-days images of his city’s past — and, to hear his glum forecast,
its future.

“Unlike the Democrats, who froze in the face of rioting and looting,
President Trump gives law enforcement the support and the tools to go
out there and put a stop to it — period, end of story,” Mr. Lynch said
on Thursday at the Republican convention.

“Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and institutions,”
he added. “The loudest voices have taken control, and our so-called
leaders are scrambling to catch up to them.”

The inclusion in the prime-time program of Mr. Lynch — who has for
decades resisted efforts to hold his 24,000 members accountable for the
deaths of civilians in their custody — sent as clear a message as any
speaker, apart perhaps from former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, of Mr.
Trump’s one-sided view of the protests against police killings.

Mr. Lynch’s comments followed a week of unrest after an officer in
Kenosha, Wis., shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, seven times in the back in
front of his young children, leaving him paralyzed. Mr. Lynch has
responded to recent police killings, including the death of George Floyd
in Minneapolis, [by accusing demonstrators of behaving like
terrorists](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/08/03/how-police-unions-fight-reform).

The political dynamic inside Mr. Lynch’s union, the Police Benevolent
Association, in some ways resembles that of the country at large; Mr.
Lynch, who enjoys deep support among white officers who live in Staten
Island, Queens and the suburbs, in 2015 survived his toughest
re-election fight, fending off two candidates who drew support from the
growing percentage of Black, Hispanic and Asian officers in his ranks.

Ann Dorn, a sergeant in the St. Louis Police Department whose husband
was killed during protests in June, described the night of his death in
emotional detail in a speech at the Republican convention.

Her husband, David Dorn, a retired police captain, was fatally shot by
someone who had broken into a pawnshop during the unrest that followed
the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mr. Dorn did not wake
her up when he went out to check on the shop, which belonged to a
friend; she found out, she said, when the chief of police rang her
doorbell at 4 a.m.

“I wondered why Dave had not answered the door,” Ms. Dorn said. “It
wasn’t uncommon for him to be up watching TV at this time. I called
out to him several times. There was no reply. He just wasn’t there. I
let in the chief, and fighting back tears, he uttered the words every
officer’s spouse dreads.”

She continued: “I relive that horror in my mind every single day. My
hope is that having you relive it with me now will help shake this
country from this nightmare we are witnessing in our cities and bring
about positive, peaceful change.”

Her appearance at the convention was part of an effort by Mr. Trump’s
campaign to portray the country as convulsed by violence and anarchy, a
dramatic exaggeration of the limited violence that has occurred amid
mostly peaceful protests. It was also an example of the rhetorical
gymnastics that [many convention speakers have been
doing](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/us/politics/rnc-trump-convention-night-3.html):
arguing that re-electing Mr. Trump is the solution to problems that are
happening now, on his watch.

“Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest,” Ms. Dorn
said. “They do not safeguard Black lives — they only destroy them.
President Trump understands this, has offered federal help to restore
order in our communities. In a time when police departments are short on
resources and manpower, we need that help.”

Mr. Dorn’s daughters [told The St. Louis
American](http://www.stlamerican.com/news/national_news/david-dorn-s-daughters-oppose-father-s-widow-speaking-at-rnc/article_da760964-e7fe-11ea-81fd-8f15f591da91.html)
this week that they were upset by Ms. Dorn’s decision to speak at the
convention, and that their father had not supported Mr. Trump.

“We know his wife is a Trump supporter, but he was not,” his daughter
Debra White told the paper. “He frequently said they were not able to
talk about politics, because they were at the opposite ends of the
spectrum. I know he would not want his legacy to be for his death to be
used to further Trump’s law-and-order agenda.”

Ben Carson, the only Black person in President Trump’s cabinet, was the
first speaker on Thursday to offer his consolation to the family of
Jacob Blake, the Kenosha, Wis., man left paralyzed after being shot by a
police officer in front of his children
—<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>striking a rare
conciliatory note during a four-day convention devoted to sharp
law-and-order rhetoric.

“Before I begin, I’d like to say that our hearts go out to the Blake
family and the other families who have been impacted by the tragic
events in Kenosha,” said Mr. Carson, the [secretary of housing and urban
development](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/05/us/ben-carson-hud.html),
while also criticizing the unrest that followed.

“As Jacob’s mother has urged the country, lets use our hearts, our love,
and our intelligence to work together to show the rest of the world how
humans are supposed to treat each other,” he said. “History reminds us
that necessary change comes through hope and love, not senseless and
destructive violence.”

Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon whose 2016 presidential campaign
flopped after a promising start, has played a paradoxical role in the
administration.

Strikingly, Mr. Carson — one of the most famous physicians in the
country — barely touched on the medical issue that has confounded Mr.
Trump, the coronavirus pandemic.

After a [white nationalist rally in Charlottesville,
Va.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/08/12/us/charlottesville-protest-white-nationalist.html),
in 2017, he quietly pressed the president to moderate his tone on the
issue of race while [publicly defending Mr.
Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/08/16/ben-carson-calls-criticism-of-trumps-charlottesville-response-little-squabbles-being-blown-out-of-proportion/)
when he equated white nationalists with counterprotesters.

Yet as HUD secretary he has pursued policies that are at the vanguard of
the president’s efforts at driving a wedge between Black homeowners and
white suburbanites, pressing for a rollback of an Obama-era inclusionary
housing plan that Mr. Trump has falsely claimed[is a Democratic attempt
to “destroy the
suburbs.”](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/us/politics/trump-obama-housing-discrimination.html)

The soft-spoken secretary has also pursued a hard-edge conservative
agenda at an agency responsible for overseeing public and subsidized
housing in low-income neighborhoods throughout the country. He has
thrown his support behind immense budget cuts proposed by Mr. Trump’s
budget office, [scrapped protections for homeless transgender
people,](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/01/us/politics/hud-transgender.html)
and [sidelined the department’s once powerful fair housing
division](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/28/us/ben-carson-hud-fair-housing-discrimination.html)
that under President Barack Obama brought desegregation cases.

After issuing his call for restraint, Mr. Carson launched into a speech
that touched on his self-help conservative philosophy, praised Mr.
Trump’s anti-abortion stance and, like so many other Black speakers at
a convention for a party overwhelmingly run by whites, vouched for Mr.
Trump’s virtue on matters of race.

“President Trump does not dabble in identity politics,” said Mr. Carson,
referring to a president who began his presidential campaign for years
ago by suggesting that Mexicans were rapists. “Many on the other side
love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist.
They could not be more wrong.”

Sean Reyes, Utah’s attorney general and a longtime backer of President
Trump, highlighted what he said was Mr. Trump’s record of cracking down
on human trafficking and stemming the nation’s opioid crisis, saying on
Thursday that he had kept his campaign promises to do both.

Mr. Reyes, who has been formally tagged as one of the Republican Party’s
“[rising
stars](https://www.gop.com/rnc-announces-winter-meeting-2015-rising-stars/),”
argued that Mr. Trump was “a fierce warrior against human trafficking”
and had taken “aggressive action to break the chains of drug addiction.”
During his time as Utah’s top law enforcement agent, Mr. Reyes has
placed the issues of human trafficking and drug use at the front of his
agenda, helming **** statewide task forces focused on both.

Citing time he spent discussing these topics with Mr. Trump, Mr. Reyes
asserted that Mr. Trump and his administration had “done more to combat
human trafficking than any administration in modern history.”

“That’s a promise kept,” he said. Similarly, he listed a number of
actions that he said Mr. Trump had taken to combat the opioid epidemic
that he said would save lives.

During his more than three years in office, Mr. Trump has sought to
fulfill a campaign promise by [declaring the opioid crisis a public
health
emergency](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html)
and [unveiling a plan to combat the
epidemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-new-hampshire-opioid-plan.html)
that involved getting “tougher on drug dealers.” He has also [promised
to
provide](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/04/24/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html)
more funding for treatment and stronger scrutiny of pharmaceutical
companies.

Many leading experts on the opioid crisis have criticized the federal
government’s response as too slow and inadequately funded. But they have
acknowledged that the situation has improved somewhat [under Mr.
Trump](https://www.whitehouse.gov/opioids/), while continuing to air
concerns that his tough talk on the epidemic often lacks details.

Earlier this year, Mr. Trump held what he called [a summit on human
trafficking](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/31/us/politics/trump-trafficking.html)
at the White House and issued an executive order aimed at combating it.
But some activists have been unsatisfied, arguing that the
administration has been dismissive of claims by women and children who
have been trafficked over the southern border; some said they did not
attend the meeting because they were concerned it would amount to a
promotional event for Mr. Trump rather than a listening session.

The son of a Spanish-Filipino father and a Japanese-Hawaiian mother, Mr.
Reyes highlighted his background in his remarks on Thursday. He opened
and closed his speech by discussing his admiration for his father, who
he said had recently died of cancer.

“When he passed, he had by his bedside: his scriptures, family photos
and a pen President Trump gave me to give him,” Mr. Reyes said of his
father. “Dad loved that pen. It represented freedom to him, the freedom
that only exists when someone is willing to fight for it. To my father,
President Trump is that ultimate warrior fighting for our freedom.”

Mr. Reyes is one of several high-profile people of color in the party
whom officials have tapped to speak throughout the four-day convention.
Most — including Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and Nikki Haley,
the former United Nations ambassador — have used at least part of their
speaking time to try to assuage voters’ concerns about Mr. Trump’s
[racist
statements](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/17/us/politics/trump-election.html)
and the Republican Party’s view on race writ large.

Mr. Reyes took office in 2013 to finish out the term of John Swallow,
who resigned during a corruption investigation. He [won re-election

and [won his Republican primary earlier this

He will face [Greg

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, said
returning President Trump to the White House for a second term was
“incredibly consequential for Middle America” in brief remarks on the
fourth night of the Republican convention.

Calling the Senate “the firewall” against Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the
Democrats, Mr. McConnell warned that voters must elect Republicans to
protect against a damaging agenda that he described with hyperbole and
exaggeration.

Democrats, he said, want to “decide how we should live our lives. They
want to tell you, when you can go to work, when your kids can go to
school. They want to tax your job out of existence, and then send you a
government check for unemployment. They want to tell you what kind of
car you can drive, what sources of information are credible, and even
how many hamburgers you can eat.”

He also warned that Democrats were [pushing for statehood for
Washington,
D.C.](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/26/us/politics/dc-statehood-house-vote.html),
saying that they want to “codify” their liberal agenda “by making the
swamp itself, Washington, D.C., America’s 51st state, with two more
liberal senators.”

He urged voters to support “my friend, President Donald Trump.”

Two men could hardly have more different personalities. Yet in the last
four years, Mr. McConnell and President Trump have become essential to
each other.

Mr. McConnell has led Republicans in the Senate since the beginning of
2007, much of that time locked in combat with a White House run by
former President Barack Obama. Mr. Trump’s election changed the
equation.

For Mr. McConnell, a six-term Kentucky senator, [the president makes
possible the pursuit of an
agenda](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/01/22/magazine/mcconnell-senate-trump.html)
that is at the core of what he believes in: a strong military, lower
taxes, conservative judges and a robust defense of anti-abortion and
pro-gun positions.

It is barely a secret on Capitol Hill that Mr. McConnell, stoic by
nature, is disdainful of the president’s undisciplined manner, his fiery
outbursts and his xenophobic messaging. But the majority leader has
rarely challenged the president publicly or privately.

Instead, Mr. McConnell is one of the president’s most ardent defenders
and led the effort to secure Mr. Trump’s acquittal after Speaker Nancy
Pelosi successfully impeached the president for high crimes and
misdemeanors just before Christmas last year.

Mr. McConnell’s ability to shape the Senate impeachment trial led to a
nearly unanimous verdict among Republicans in favor of the president’s
acquittal; only Senator Mitt Romney of Utah voted for one of the
articles of impeachment.

But perhaps the most important role Mr. McConnell has played in the last
four years has been to successfully secure the confirmation of more than
200 federal judges, including two Supreme Court justices and more than
50 judges on the appeals courts.

That legacy is likely to outlast Mr. Trump, whether he wins another four
years in the White House or not.

Dan Scavino first met President Trump in 1992, when he was chosen to be
his golf caddie.

The rest, as they say, is history.

Mr. Scavino has the distinction of being Mr. Trump’s longest-serving
White House aide in a West Wing known for its fast-moving revolving door
where tenures are sometimes measured in 11-day increments known as
“Scaramuccis.” Mr. Scavino, in contrast to basically everyone else,
has always been there.

“I have now been at President Trump’s side for almost 30 years,” he said
in his remarks Thursday night. “He saw potential in me. A spark. The
possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I
thought was possible.”

After working as the general manager of Trump National Golf Club, he
moved from the Trump Organization to the 2016 campaign, where he served
as Mr. Trump’s social media director.

In the White House, he has risen to be a deputy chief of staff for
communications. Mr. Scavino is not a shaper of Trump administration
policy, but he is a shaper of Trump tweets. (He is often the person who
workshops tweets with Mr. Trump, and posts them to his Twitter feed.)

In an administration where senior officials are often caught off guard
by announcements the president shares on Twitter, having some control on
the account gives him a curiously powerful position in Trumpworld.

While he is often in the room, Mr. Scavino is rarely heard from. His
appearance at the Republican National Convention on the final night
marked a rare public foray for a behind-the-scenes staffer, and
something of a reward for a staff member Mr. Trump is considers loyal
and appreciates for not obviously trying to cash in on his association
with the president.

His inclusion in the program built on what viewers have seen all week
from White House staff members: personal testimonials vouching for a
thoughtful boss whose empathy is genuine and simply not seen on the
public stage. The pitch: take our word for it.

“If there is one thing I hope you will hear from me tonight, it is this
— President Trump is a kind and decent man,” he said. “I wish you
could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he
meets.”

Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who garnered national
attention late last year after he [voted against impeaching President
Trump](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/10/31/us/politics/who-voted-against-impeachment.html)
and then left the Democratic Party to become a Republican, said Thursday
that the party he departed had “moved from liberal to radical” as he
sought to paint his former caucus and its leaders in an uncharitable
light.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>

Mr. Van Drew, a centrist freshman who [has pledged his “undying support”
for Mr. Trump and curried favor with
him](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/19/us/politics/jeff-van-drew-trump.html),
praised the president once more, saying he had “made me feel more
comfortable and welcome in the Oval Office than Nancy Pelosi ever made
me feel in her caucus.”

**“**There are a lot of Democrats who support our President and are
disgusted for what their old Party — what my old Party — has become,” he
said. “Here’s my advice: be true to who you are now, not who the
Democrats used to be.”

During his remarks, Mr. Van Drew, a former dentist and state legislator,
recounted his days in the national political spotlight, framing his
decision to [deflect from the
Democrats](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/14/us/politics/jeff-van-drew-democrat-republican.html)
and oppose impeachment as an “easy call.”

He also attacked Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic nominee, echoing
the Trump campaign’s prediction that once in office, the former vice
president would move further to the left.

And although his vote and subsequent party change led to praise from Mr.
Trump and may have [helped him win the Republican
primary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/07/07/us/elections/results-new-jersey-house-district-2-primary-election.html),
Mr. Van Drew now faces a tough general-election fight to continue
representing the Second District, in South Jersey. His decision to
switch parties [enraged both Democrats and Republicans in New
Jersey](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2019/12/16/nyregion/jeff-van-drew-democrat-republican.html).
And he now faces a stiff challenge in November from Amy Kennedy, an
educator and mental health advocate who is the wife of former
Representative Patrick J. Kennedy.

The district is Republican-leaning and was represented by a Republican
for 24 years before Mr. Van Drew’s election in 2018. [The Cook Political
Report](https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings) gives him
a narrow edge in this year’s race, and by backing Mr. Trump in a
nationally televised appearance, he is likely to shore up support among
staunch conservatives even if, at the same time, he provides additional
campaign fodder for Ms. Kennedy.

Mr. Trump won the congressional district by about five percentage points
in 2016.

Ja’Ron Smith, one of the most powerful Black White House aides, on
Thursday painted a very different picture of President Trump’s behavior
than the one related by many Black leaders, and the families of people
killed by law enforcement.

“I have seen his true conscience. I just wish everyone would see the
deep empathy he shows the families whose loved ones were killed due to
senseless violence,” said Mr. Smith, a former top aide to Senator Tim
Scott, Republican of South Carolina.

Mr. Smith serves in a Trump White House that has few people of color in
positions of real authority.

He was the driving force behind the creation of “Opportunity Zones,” the
nascent tax credit program aimed at increasing investment in low income
areas, and he was one of the very few Trump aides who said they had
reached out to Black leaders during the protests after the killing of

“As Republicans, it’s our mission to renew the American dream, restore
our way of life and rebuild the greatest economy in the world,” Mr.
Smith said on Thursday. “The socialist Democrats have a different
agenda.”

Mr. Smith told the story of an epiphany — a broken leg — that kept him
off his high school football field and impelled him to raise his 1.9
grade point average.

In an address that replayed many of the Republican convention’s biggest
catchphrases, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House
minority leader, said the choice before voters “could not be clearer.”

“Forward in freedom or backward in socialism,” he said. “Forward in
prosperity or backward in poverty. Forward in personal liberty or
backward in more government control.”

Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris would “dismantle our
institutions, defund our police and destroy our economy,” he added,
repeating one of the most frequent lies of the week. Mr. Biden does not
support defunding the police; in fact, he has explicitly rejected calls
to do so.

In a speech that was mostly built on generalities, Mr. McCarthy came
closest to discussing specific policies when he said President Trump had
“confronted China head on, tore up bad trade deals and made better ones,
supported our men and women in uniform and took out the world’s top
terrorists, achieved energy independence, defended the sanctity of life,
restored law and order at the border.”

Since the Democratic wave of 2018 demoted him from majority leader [to
minority
leader](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/11/13/us/politics/kevin-mccarthy-house-republican-leader.html)
— a status that does not appear likely to change in November, with
Democrats favored to retain control of the House — Mr. McCarthy has
[carved out a niche for
himself](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/01/22/us/politics/kevin-mccarthy-trump.html)
in Mr. Trump’s party. Notably, he kept House Republicans unified against
impeachment.

The Rev. Franklin Graham, one of President Trump’s [most prominent
evangelical
supporters](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/26/us/billy-graham-franklin-graham-trump.html),
opened the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention
with a prayer for Mr. Trump and his family, asking God to “unite our
hearts to be one nation.”

Mr. Graham — the elder son of the Rev. Billy Graham, who built an
evangelical empire and was for decades a spiritual adviser to presidents
of both political parties before his [death
in 2018](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/02/21/obituaries/billy-graham-dead.html)
— is a fierce defender of Mr. Trump and his agenda.

“Our country is facing trouble,” Mr. Graham said in his prayer,
referencing “tens of thousands in the path of a deadly storm.” The
pandemic, he said, “has gripped millions of hearts with fear. We’re
divided. We have witnessed injustice. Anger and despair have flowed into
the streets. We need your help. We need to hear your voice at this
crucial hour.”

The president and chief executive of Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian
international relief organization, the younger Mr. Graham has been a key
ally in Mr. Trump’s successful efforts to cement his support among
evangelical voters, especially in key swing states.

In 2016, Mr. Graham criticized the [“crude
comments”](https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/FranklinGraham/posts/the-crude-comments-made-by-donald-j-trump-more-than-11-years-ago-cannot-be-defen/1271741769548668/)
revealed in a 2005 tape of Mr. Trump talking about [grabbing women’s
private
parts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html).
But he also condemned the “godless progressive agenda” of Hillary
Clinton. And after Mr. Trump won the election, Mr. Graham became a vocal
defender of the president.

In 2018, after Walmart briefly sold T-shirts that said “Impeach 45,” Mr.
Graham responded by selling “Pray for 45” T-shirts. In June, after Mr.
Trump[came under fire for using a Bible as a
prop](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html)
in front of a Washington, D.C., church during [protests about racial
injustice](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/news-event/george-floyd-protests-minneapolis-new-york-los-angeles),
Mr. Graham again defended him vigorously.

Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington,
[accused the
president](https://twitter.com/washdio/status/1267616423142141954) of
using her church “as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the
teachings of Jesus.” Asked later whether he was offended by the
president’s behavior, Mr. Graham wrote a lengthy defense of the
president on his Facebook page.

“Offended? Not at all,” he wrote. “This made an important statement that
what took place the night before in the burning, looting, and vandalism
of the nation’s capital — including this historic house of worship —
mattered, and that the lawlessness had to end.”

Joseph R. Biden Jr. responded on Thursday to Vice President Mike Pence’s
blunt warning at the Republican National Convention that “you won’t be
safe in Joe Biden’s America” by saying that “the problem we have right
now is we are in Donald Trump’s America.”

“If you want to talk about safety, the biggest safety issue is people
dying from Covid,” Mr. Biden said in an interview on MSNBC, during which
he discussed the coronavirus pandemic, the millions of Americans who
have lost their jobs and the unrest over policing that has gripped the
nation.

“More people have died on this president’s watch than at just about any
time in American history, on a daily basis,” Mr. Biden said. “And what’s
he doing, what’s he doing about it? He continues to flaunt every single
basic rule and basic tenet that Democrats and Republicans both have
adhered to.”

which Republicans have seized on to try to present themselves as the
party of law and order, Mr. Biden condemned violence “in any form” but
also said that he supported the right to protest peacefully.

And he said that he was troubled by reports that Kyle Rittenhouse, a
17-year-old who was arrested in connection with shootings that left two
people dead on Tuesday night, may have had “a connection to a militia in
Illinois.”

“This is not who we are,” Mr. Biden said. “This is not who America is.
They want to bring about some order in safety and security for people,
we have to start dealing with the real problems underlying all these
issues. And the president never speaks to that.”

WASHINGTON — Senator Kamala Harris said on Thursday that the Republican
National Convention was operating in an alternate reality that ignored
the coronavirus pandemic and unrest over the repeated police shooting of
Black people.

“Unlike the Democratic convention, which was very cleareyed about the
challenges we are facing and how we can tackle them, the Republican
convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump’s ego, to
make him feel good,” said Ms. Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice
president. “He is the president of the United States and it’s not
supposed to be about him. It’s supposed to be about the health and
safety and the well-being of the American people. And on that measure,
Donald Trump has failed.”

The remarks, delivered to about two dozen journalists in an auditorium
at George Washington University, appeared to be an attempt to focus
public attention on Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an
issue avoided by most of this week’s speakers at the Republican National
Convention. Very few convention speakers have addressed the
[nearly 180,000 Americans who have died from the
virus](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html),
with discussion of the pandemic instead focusing on how China, where it
originated, failed to contain the virus.

Ms. Harris, whom aides said would “prosecute the case” against Mr.
Trump, said the president has “failed at the most basic and important
job” of the presidency. She accused him of being too cozy with the
Chinese government, citing his January statement praising the country
for its transparency in dealing with the virus.

The senator couched her attack on Mr. Trump in the most personal of
terms, suggesting he had choked under pressure. (The president has often
ridiculed others for weakness under pressure, which he perceives as a
fatal character flaw.)

“Right at the moment we needed him to be tough on the Chinese
government, he caved,” Ms. Harris said. “Instead of rising to meet the
most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was
scared.”

Ms. Harris addressed for the first time before television cameras the
Sunday police shooting of Jacob Blake, the Black man shot seven times in
the back by the police in Kenosha, Wis.

“It’s sickening to watch, it’s all too familiar and it must end,” Ms.
Harris said. She added that peaceful protesters should not be confused
with “those looting and committing acts of violence.” An Illinois
teenager was charged Wednesday with two counts of homicide after the
fatal shootings of two people.

“We will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to
justice,” she said.

## [The Biden campaign made a $2 million ad buy for the final night of the G.O.P. convention.](#the-biden-campaign-made-a-2-million-ad-buy-for-the-final-night-of-the-gop-convention)

</div>

The Biden campaign will spend more than $2 million to air a two-minute
ad on national networks and Fox News during coverage of the Republican
National Convention tonight.

The ad spreads the campaign’s message of resilience and hope for
recovery while also getting in a few not-so-subtle digs at President
Trump, who is formally accepting his party’s renomination at the
convention finale.

“When Joe Biden is president, America is just going to have to keep up,”
the ad says, after the narrator tweaks those who “take it slow” as a
shot of Mr. Trump gingerly ambling down a ramp in West Point plays. “We
won’t have to wait to deal with Covid-19: He already has a plan.”

<div class="css-1u3pw94">

</div>

Both campaigns have been aggressively seeking to bracket the other’s
conventions with paid messaging. Last week, during the Democratic
convention, the [Trump campaign ran an enormous digital ad
operation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/15/us/politics/trump-campaign-ads-dnc.html),
monopolizing the top strip of YouTube for a 96-hour stretch and taking
over the home pages of The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post
for 24 hours at a time. That digital buy, which cost more than $10
million, reached tens of millions of voters.

Buying lengthy ad slots has been a campaign tactic for years. Some
candidates have even bought full 30-minute slots to run a
campaign-produced documentary on broadcast television.

But an ad buy of this scale during the final day of a political
convention is rare, even in the post-Citizens United, post-public
financing world of modern political campaigns.

The ad will air on CBS, ABC and NBC nationally, and will also run on Fox
News, local Fox affiliates and Fox Sports 1.
