  - U.S. stocks climbed on Wednesday, following a rally on Tuesday after
    [Treasury Secretary Steven
    Mnuchin](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/business/economy/mnuchin-coronavirus.html)
    suggested to lawmakers that the Trump administration might be open
    to a stimulus package as large as $1.5 trillion. The S\&P 500 rose
    1.5 percent to set another record. **It was the index‚Äôs best day
    since July 6**.

  - The Dow Jones Industrial index closed above 29,000 for the first
    time since February, though **it is still more than 450 points off
    its record high**. President Trump crowed about the index‚Äôs
    performance [on
    Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1301249968091455488):
    ‚ÄúYou are so lucky to have me as your President üòâ‚Äù

  - Shares of giant technology companies helped lead the gains in the
    S\&P 500, where the large weighting of such stocks gives them
    outsized influence. **Twitter** was one of the best-performing
    stocks of the day, rising more than 6 percent, **Alphabet** rose
    nearly 4 percent and **Facebook** rose by more than 2 percent.

  - But other more defensive sectors, such as utilities and health care,
    also fared well, generating the highest percentage gains of any of
    the S\&P 500‚Äôs 11 sectors. Energy was the only S\&P sector to
    decline.

  - The [ADP report on private sector
    payrolls](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2020/August/NER/NER-August-2020.aspx),
    which was released Wednesday morning, showed that **hiring increased
    in August** from the prior month but fell below what economists had
    expected. Investors are more focused on the Labor Department‚Äôs
    monthly jobs report, which is set to be released on Friday.

  - The downbeat economic data seemed to drive increased expectations
    from investors that more support from the Federal Reserve, in the
    form of lower long-term interest rates, would be coming. The yield
    on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level in more than a
    week, at 0.65 percent.

  - **European markets were also higher**, with benchmark indexes up
    more than 1 percent. Asian markets ended the day broadly lower, a
    trend defied by Japan‚Äôs Nikkei, which closed up about half a
    percent.

  - Investors were encouraged by fresh economic data from around the
    world that signaled a recovery from the devastation of the pandemic
    was underway. U.S. manufacturing data [released
    Tuesday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/09/01/business/01reuters-usa-economy.html)
    showed that **new orders surged in August**. A report [from the
    eurozone](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/reuters/2020/09/01/us/01reuters-eurozone-economy-pmi.html?searchResultPosition=5)
    Tuesday also showed that manufacturing activity had increased for
    the second straight
month.

The amount of U.S. government debt will nearly outpace the size of the
nation‚Äôs economy in the 2020 fiscal year, the Congressional Budget
Office [said on
Wednesday](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-09/56517-Budget-Outlook.pdf),
a level not reached since the immediate aftermath of World War II and a
direct result of the pandemic recession.

The federal budget deficit is expected to reach $3.3 trillion for the
fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, the budget office said. Total debt
held by the public is expected to reach an estimated 98 percent of the
size of the economy ‚Äî gross domestic product ‚Äî for the year. It falls
just short of equaling the size of the economy: The last fiscal year
when the amount of federal debt was larger than the sum of the nation‚Äôs
annual economic output was in 1946.

The budget office now expects the debt to exceed the size of the economy
in fiscal year 2021. By 2023, it said on Wednesday, it expects the debt
as a share of the economy to reach its highest level in American
history, surpassing the World War II era.

The United States appeared to have passed the debt milepost[in
June](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/business/economy/national-debt-coronavirus-stimulus.html),
when the total debt exceeded the size of a year‚Äôs worth of economic
output.

The pandemic recession plunged the economy into its sharpest quarterly
contraction in growth in nearly 75 years, ballooning the deficit in the
process. With millions out of work and businesses shuttered, tax
revenues fell for the federal government, along with states and
municipalities. Congress and President Trump moved quickly to approve
more than $3 trillion in new federal spending to help businesses and
individuals through the [abrupt slowdown in economic
activity](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-economy-shutdown.html).
All of those factors converged to send deficits ‚Äî which had grown
steadily even in the expansion years under Mr. Trump before the crisis
hit ‚Äî soaring.

While most economists think the federal government should not be worried
about deficit spending in the midst of a severe downturn, concerns over
the amount of federal borrowing have hindered bipartisan negotiations
over another round of economic assistance this fall. Democrats started
talks pushing for a more-than $3 trillion package. Republicans countered
with about $1 trillion, citing, in part, concerns over the rising
amounts of debt.

But even many deficit hawks in Washington, while alarmed by the swift
rise in debt, continue to urge lawmakers to spend more to stimulate the
recovery.

‚ÄúI think we should think and worry about the deficit an awful lot,‚Äù said
Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal
Budget in Washington, ‚Äúand we should proceed to make it larger‚Äù this
fall.

The Federal Reserve‚Äôs regular survey of its nationwide business contacts
showed that the pandemic continues to weigh on regional economies ‚Äî and
signaled that in many places, the pace of the post-lockdown rebound
began to slow by late August.

While vehicle sales, tourism and retail had been boosting consumer
spending, ‚Äúmany Districts noted a slowing pace of growth in these areas,
and total spending was still far below pre-pandemic levels,‚Äù according
to the so-called ‚Äú[Beige
Book](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20200902.pdf)‚Äù
report for August 2020. ‚ÄúCommercial construction was down widely, and
commercial real estate remained in contraction.‚Äù

Housing was a bright spot, the report said, but the agriculture and
energy industries continued to struggle. Continued uncertainty driven by
the pandemic ‚Äúwas a theme echoed across the country.‚Äù Employment was
rising, but temporary layoffs were also turning permanent in many
places.

In the New York region, ‚Äúwhile more manufacturers said they anticipated
staff increases than reductions, the reverse was true among service
sector businesses ‚Äî especially those in the information, transportation,
and warehousing industries.‚Äù

Even as jobs disappeared in some areas and the pace of labor market
improvement slowed in others, businesses complained about struggling to
hire. Some cited expanded unemployment benefits, which lapsed at the end
of July, along with day care and school closings that kept parents at
home.

‚ÄúA lack of access to day care and unwillingness of some working parents
to send their children to day care contributed to a reduced pool of
candidates,‚Äù according to contacts in the Boston Fed‚Äôs district. ‚ÄúBy
contrast, one contact saw increased applicants, citing recent layoffs
and furloughs as driving factors.‚Äù

**United Airlines** said Wednesday that it expects to furlough 16,370
employees starting Oct. 1, when federal restrictions on job cuts that
were a condition of government aid end.

The announcement, which comes a week after a similar one from
**[American
Airlines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/business/american-airline-furlough-19000.html)**,
could put further pressure on Congress and the Trump administration to
renew the $25 billion in stimulus funding the federal government
provided to passenger airlines in March. A union-led effort to extend
that funding has received bipartisan support, but lawmakers and the
administration are at an impasse over further pandemic relief.

‚ÄúTo be clear, an extension would be the one thing that would prevent
involuntary furloughs on October 1 and hopefully delay any potential
impact on employees until early 2021,‚Äù the airline told employees on
Wednesday. Tens of thousands of United employees have already contacted
their representatives to renew the funding and the airline encouraged
others to do so.

The Oct. 1 cut would affect nearly 7,000 flight attendants, nearly 3,000
pilots and thousands of others who work in maintenance, airport
operations and other roles. United had warned 36,000 employees in July
that they could be subject to the furlough, but that figure was greatly
reduced in large part because thousands of employees agreed to take
buyouts, early retirement or temporary leave.

Airlines have introduced a broad range of voluntary programs to offset
costs and save jobs. Some United employees who work in airport
operations, at contact centers or in maintenance, for example, have been
offered a year of leave during which they will receive health benefits
and a quarter of their salary. Flight attendants have been able to sign
up for extended leave with health benefits with the right to return to
work if flights are available. In both cases, the airline would be able
to call the employees back when demand recovers.

Last week, American said that it expects to cut as many as 19,000
workers starting Oct. 1. **[Delta Air
Lines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/24/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/delta-says-it-will-need-to-furlough-2000-pilots-in-october)**
has said it may need to furlough nearly 2,000 pilots, even after nearly
as many signed up for early retirement. **Southwest Airlines** has said
it expects to avoid broad cuts, at least for the rest of the year.

The number of people flying is down about 70 percent from a year ago and
isn‚Äôt expected to recover substantially until a coronavirus vaccine is
widely available. The World Travel & Tourism Council, an industry group,
said on Wednesday that the devastating drop in international travel
would cost the U.S. economy $155 billion this year.

**Ford Motor** said Wednesday that it planned to eliminate about 1,400
salaried jobs in North America by the end of the year to lower costs.

The automaker told workers that it would offer incentives to encourage
employees to leave voluntarily but would resort to layoffs if not enough
people took buyout packages.

‚ÄúWe are in a multiyear process of making Ford more fit and effective
around the world,‚Äù Kumar Galhotra, the president of the company‚Äôs
Americas and international markets group, said in an email to employees.

The job cuts come as Ford replaces its top executive. Its chief
executive for the last three years, Jim Hackett, is set to retire in
October, and will be succeeded by James Farley, the chief operating
officer.

Mr. Hackett has worked to streamline Ford, but so far has achieved mixed
results. He is credited with revamping Ford‚Äôs model line, developing a
battery-powered Mustang sport-utility vehicle and a new line of Bronco
sport-utility vehicles. But the company‚Äôs financial performance has
lagged other big automakers and its share price has languished in the
single digits for most of the last two years.

After almost 30 years of economic growth, [Australia officially fell
into
recession](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/business/australia-recession.html)
after its economy shrank 7 percent in the second quarter, the government
said on Wednesday.

The drop in quarterly G.D.P. is the largest since record-keeping began
in 1959, Michael Smedes, head of national accounts at the Australian
Bureau of Statistics, said [in a
statement](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs%40.nsf/mediareleasesbyCatalogue/C9973AC780DDFD3FCA257F690011045C?OpenDocument).

Restrictions that were imposed in March during the virus‚Äôs first surge
greatly reduced domestic spending on transportation, hotels and
restaurants, while border bans hit the tourism and education industries.

Australia‚Äôs second-most populous state, Victoria, remains under lockdown
as it fights a surge that was [driven by returning
travelers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/04/world/australia/coronavirus-melbourne-lockdown.html).
Officials on Wednesday extended Victoria‚Äôs state of emergency for six
months, a designation that gives them broad powers to enact
virus-related restrictions as needed.

In the end, more than $150 billion in stimulus packages could not ward
off a recession.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs devastating numbers confirm what every Australian knows: that
Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on our economy and our lives like nothing we
have ever experienced before,‚Äù Josh Frydenberg, the country‚Äôs treasurer,
said on Wednesday.

The new data marked a sobering end to [what had once seemed an endless
boom](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/27/world/australia/australia-coronavirus-economy.html)
driven by immigration, rising trade with Asia and careful monetary
policy. More than [a million Australians were unemployed in
July](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6202.0), and the
unemployment rate of 7.5 percent was the worst in 22 years.

‚ÄúThe road ahead will be long,‚Äù Mr. Frydenberg said. ‚ÄúThe road ahead will
be hard. The road ahead will be bumpy.‚Äù

Australia has recorded 663 coronavirus deaths and more than 25,000
cases, [according to a New York Times
database](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#countries).

The British economy could suffer longer-term damage and a slower
recovery than
[the](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/business/britains-economy-wont-fully-recover-till-end-of-2021-its-central-bankers-said.html)**[Bank
of

forecasting](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/06/business/britains-economy-wont-fully-recover-till-end-of-2021-its-central-bankers-said.html),
two of its policymakers said on Wednesday.

Speaking to a parliamentary committee, the central bankers warned that
the economy, which suffered its [worst recession since official
record-keeping began in
the 1950s](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/business/britain-economy-recession-coronavirus.html),
faced bigger risks than current estimates anticipate.

‚ÄúOnce we‚Äôre on the other side of the Covid shock, we think the level of
G.D.P. will be permanently about 1.5 percent lower,‚Äù Dave Ramsden, the
deputy governor of the central bank, said of the current forecast. ‚ÄúFor
me, all the risks are really that that number will be greater than 1.5
percent.‚Äù

The bank‚Äôs forecast already anticipates some economic mismatch lasting a
long time, meaning that some people who lose their jobs will struggle to
find new employment because they won‚Äôt have the right skills. But there
could be other impacts that have not yet been accounted for, such as a
lack of investment in commercial real estate as more people work from
home, or an increase in spending on machinery and other equipment in the
retail sector as it pivots to online shopping at the expense of workers‚Äô
wages.

The central bank expects the output gap ‚Äî the difference between the
actual output of the economy and what it has the potential to achieve ‚Äî
to close in about a year and a half. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs quite quick,‚Äù said
Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the central bank‚Äôs monetary policy
committee.

He said that if unemployment stayed high while the economy tried to
undergo a structural change, [more
monetary](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/08/28/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#bank-of-england-chief-says-negative-rates-are-possible-in-the-uk)
and fiscal stimulus would be needed to get the economy ‚Äúrunning at full
capacity.‚Äù

**Macy‚Äôs**, the biggest department store company in the United States,
on Wednesday
[reported](https://www.macysinc.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/1637/macys-inc-reports-second-quarter-2020-results)
another significant slide in quarterly sales, but struck an upbeat tone,
saying that the performance was ‚Äústronger than anticipated.‚Äù

The New York-based retailer, which also owns **Bloomingdale‚Äôs** and
**Bluemercury**, said that sales fell 36 percent, to $3.6 billion, in
the quarter ending Aug. 1. It reported a net loss of $431 million. Like
many other retailers, Macy‚Äôs said that its digital sales grew, by 53
percent, in the quarter, while in-store sales plunged 61 percent.

Macy‚Äôs said it was not providing a full-year forecast as uncertainty
persisted, but it expected its comparable sales to drop by the ‚Äúlow- to
mid-20s‚Äù during the fall. On an earnings call, the retailer said that it
expected at least 40 percent of its total sales to be digital going
forward, up from 25 percent last year.

‚ÄúThe store remains a very, very important component of our brands,‚Äù said
Jeff Gennette, Macy‚Äôs chief executive. But as the pandemic persists,
customers are not using the stores to browse, he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre
mission-based: They‚Äôre coming in for a transaction, they‚Äôre lingering
less time in stores, and they‚Äôre buying at a higher conversion rate.‚Äù

Macy‚Äôs is a linchpin of the mall, and its results provide a window into
how and where Americans are shopping. Dresses, men‚Äôs clothing and formal
shoes, and luggage have been weak categories, the company said on the
call, as it observed a big shift into purchases of activewear and
athletic footwear. The retail giant also noted ‚Äúdisproportionately
strong‚Äù performance in luxury categories like fragrances and diamonds
and said its strongest business was in homewares, beauty and certain
accessories categories.

The coronavirus outbreak and widespread store closures drove Macy‚Äôs
sales down by 45 percent to about $3 billion in the [first
quarter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/02/business/macys-herald-square-protests.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article),
which ended May 2, and the retailer posted a net loss of $3.6 billion.
It said in June that it was cutting [3,900 corporate and
managemen](https://www.macysinc.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/1630/macys-inc-announces-restructuring-to-address-sales)t
positions.

Macy‚Äôs staggered the release of its dismal first-quarter results across
three months. It has continued to struggle as consumers are [especially
slow
to](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/interactive/2020/08/18/business/economy/coronavirus-economic-recovery-states.html)
return to enclosed malls.

In February, before the virus began spreading across the U.S., Macy‚Äôs
had announced [plans to close at least 125
stores](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/02/04/business/macys-store-closings.html)
in the next three years and cut about 2,000 jobs. Those closings are
expected to leave the company with about 400 locations.

The retailer, one of the most iconic destinations during the holiday
season, said Wednesday that it was preparing to start promotions
earlier, create a safe store environment and give customers the option
to buy items in advance, which they can retrieve curbside or in stores.

## [Republicans and Democrats agree the economy needs more stimulus ‚Äî but not on how to do it.](#mnuchin)

</div>

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says ‚Äú[there is more work to be
done](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/business/economy/mnuchin-coronavirus.html)‚Äù
to help the U.S. economy recover from its pandemic-induced recession.
But he and Democrats disagree on the scale of the problem, and the scope
of the solution, making it hard to predict when ‚Äî or if ‚Äî lawmakers will
strike a deal on another economic stimulus package, today‚Äôs [DealBook
newsletter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/business/dealbook/coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html)
explains.

**Mr. Mnuchin and House Democrats painted different pictures of the
economy** at a congressional hearing yesterday. While the Treasury
secretary said the economy was ‚Äúdoing great‚Äù relative to the worst-case
pandemic situations, the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, Democrat of
South Carolina, warned of a ‚ÄúK-shaped‚Äù recovery, in which the wealthy
bounce back and the rest lag behind.

**Who‚Äôs right?** A number of economic reports are due this week that
could shed some light on the course of the recovery. Today, the
Congressional Budget Office will release an update to its 10-year
economic projections. On Thursday, weekly jobless claims are expected to
show a large decline, due mostly to [methodological
changes](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-labor-department-will-start-counting-unemployment-claims-in-a-new-way).
On Friday, the monthly report on jobs is predicted to show the
unemployment rate falling to single digits for the first time during the
pandemic, to a level roughly equal to the *peak* reached during the
global financial crisis.

  - The weekly ‚Äúrecovery tracker‚Äù assembled by **Oxford Economics**,
    which mashes together a range of high-frequency statistics on
    consumer demand, employment, financial markets, health, mobility and
    production, reckons that the U.S. economy is now operating around 80
    percent of normal, with muted improvement in recent
weeks.

**Is help on the way?** Mr. Mnuchin told the House Select Subcommittee
on the Coronavirus Crisis yesterday that he would call House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi ‚Äúright after the hearing‚Äù to discuss the next stimulus
bill. They spoke for more than 30 minutes, but Ms. Pelosi said afterward
that there were ‚Äúserious differences understanding the gravity of the
situation‚Äù between the White House and Democrats.

    in the country for the rest of the year as the nation grapples with
    the coronavirus pandemic. The order, put forward by the Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention, said the action was needed to avoid
    having renters lose their homes and wind up in shelters or other
    crowded living conditions, compounding the crisis. To apply for the
    new moratorium, tenants would have to attest to a substantial loss
    of household income, the inability to pay full rent and best efforts
    to pay partial rent. Tenants would also need to stipulate that
    eviction would be likely to leave them homeless or force them to
    live with others at close quarters.
