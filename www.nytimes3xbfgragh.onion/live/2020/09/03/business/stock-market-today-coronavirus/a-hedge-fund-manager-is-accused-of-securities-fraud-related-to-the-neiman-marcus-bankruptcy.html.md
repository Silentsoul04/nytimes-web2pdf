High-flying tech stocks stumbled sharply on Thursday, causing the S\&P
500 to close with its worst drop since June.

The S\&P 500 dropped 3.5 percent, wiping out more than a week of gains,
while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was down nearly 5 percent. The Dow
Jones industrial average briefly lost 1,000 points and ended the day
down more than 800 points. **Apple** was down 8 percent. **Amazon** was
down more than 4.5 percent, and **Microsoft** was down more than 6
percent.

As investors have bet that the coronavirus crisis would amplify the
dominance of the tech companies’ business models, share prices of large
cap technology companies have surged, generating the lion’s share of the
stock market’s gains.

The [rip-roaring race for tech
shares](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/18/business/stock-market-record.html)
has increasingly pulled in armchair investors, who have taken up
speculating on stocks amid the work-from-home environment. Many of those
traders have opted not to buy actual shares, but instead to speculate in
options trades, which are essentially leveraged bets on where share
prices will go.

Such traders make these bets — mostly they have been “calls” or bets
that the tech share prices would rise — with options dealers, who then
have to hedge their risks. Dealers hedge their risks by buying “puts,”
or leveraged bets that shares will fall.

Analysts say dealers have rushed to boost their bets on falling shares
in recent days in an attempt to hedge their risks, amplifying the
sell-off in technology shares.

“I think today for tech stocks, you’re seeing that dynamic play out —
you have a sell-off that is being chased by dealers,” said Yousef
Abbasi, director of U.S. institutional equities at StoneX, a brokerage
firm.

Stocks had been on a significant tear in recent days. Prior to Thursday,
the S\&P 500 had been up in nine of the last 10 sessions, a run that
some observers said suggested that investors appeared to have adopted a
Pollyannish outlook.

“Stocks were extended, complacency and optimism, widespread,” William
Delwiche, an investment strategist at **Baird**, a financial firm based
in Milwaukee, wrote in an email. “Given the speed of the move and
imbalanced positioning, the cart doesn’t need to go over much of a bump
to send apples flying everywhere.”

Thursday’s tumble was one of the worst jolts to the market since a new
bull market began in late March. Since March 23, when the Federal
Reserve signaled its willingness to provide unlimited support to key
financial markets, stocks have notched remarkable gains.

As of the close of trading on Wednesday, they were up 60 percent over
that period, helping pull the market to new record-highs.

The performance of the market — the S\&P 500 was up more than 10 percent
for the year as of Wednesday’s close — has been a conundrum for some who
have wondered whether such gains were sustainable in the face of a deep
economic decline set off by the pandemic.

On Thursday, a fresh update on [new claims for unemployment
insurance](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/03/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/new-state-unemployment-claims-remained-high-in-the-latest-weekly-tally)
showed that the virus was still battering the labor market, with more
than 800,000 people filing claims for new benefits last week. About 29
million were receiving some form of unemployment assistance as of
mid-August, a sign of deep distress in the “real” economy.

**FedEx** said Thursday that it plans to hire 70,000 U.S. workers to
prepare for the upcoming holiday season. That’s a 27 percent increase
from last year, when the company brought on 55,000 workers to prepare
for the holidays.

The announcement comes in anticipation of [a holiday season in which
many consumers will be
housebound](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/02/business/retailers-holiday-shopping.html)
and reliant on online shopping — and package delivery — to buy gifts.
Major retailers have already started shifting their plans to focus on
e-commerce rather than in-store holiday sales events. **Walmart** and
**Target** have recently
[announced](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/07/27/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#target-thanksgiving)
that they will reduce crowds by closing their doors on Thanksgiving Day
and putting their best deals online earlier than usual.

FedEx also
[announced](https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/fedex-enhancements-position-company-ahead-of-a-record-setting-peak-season/)plans
to expand year-round Sunday residential coverage for its FedEx Ground
service to nearly 95 percent of the U.S. population, effective September
13.

“These strategic investments will help better support what is expected
to be an unprecedented holiday shipping season,” Raj Subramaniam,
FedEx’s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.

While hiring in the U.S. is still far below normal levels, job search
sites [have seen the number of listings creep
up](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/03/business/economy/unemployment-claims.html).
Construction, driving and warehouse jobs are the most available,
according to Indeed.

</div>

A hedge fund manager is accused of pressuring an investment bank to
abandon its bid to buy shares of the bankrupt retailer **Neiman
Marcus**, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in
Manhattan.

Daniel Kamensky, founder of the hedge fund Marble Ridge Capital, was
arrested Thursday on charges that include securities fraud and
obstruction of justice. Federal authorities contend that Mr. Kamensky
tried to persuade the investment bank not to report his actions.

Mr. Kamensky is accused of trying to manipulate the bankruptcy process
to his advantage using his power as a member of the committee of
unsecured creditors of Neiman Marcus.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a related civil fraud
complaint, accuses Mr. Kamensky of threatening to stop doing business
with the investment bank Jefferies if it did not withdraw its bid for
shares of Neiman Marcus, which was higher than the one submitted by Mr.
Kamensky’s hedge fund. Securities regulators said Mr. Kamensky told
Jefferies that if it did not withdraw the bid, he would get other
creditors to reject its bid.

A lawyer for Mr. Kamensky, whose hedge fund managed about $1 billion,
was not immediately available for comment.

Jefferies withdrew its bid but told the other creditors of Neiman Marcus
why. Mr. Kamensky then tried to get Jefferies to change its story, the
S.E.C. complaint said, and in the process “admitted to Jefferies that he
could go to jail.”

The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against
**Google** as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr
overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a
strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable
technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal
department conversations.

Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust
inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap
up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people.
Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation
opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and
several of them left the case this summer.

Some argued this summer in a memo that ran hundreds of pages that they
could bring a strong case but needed more time, according to people who
described the document. Disagreement persisted among the team over how
broad the complaint should be and what Google could do to resolve the
problems the government uncovered. The lawyers viewed the deadline as
arbitrary.

Beyond the disagreements about tactics, career lawyers also expressed
concerns that Mr. Barr wanted to announce the case in September to take
credit for action against a powerful tech company under the Trump
administration.

But Mr. Barr felt that the department had moved too slowly and that the
deadline was not unreasonable, according to a senior Justice Department
official.

Mr. Barr, a former telecom industry executive who argued an antitrust
matter before the Supreme Court, has shown a [deep interest in the
Google
investigation](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/06/25/technology/barr-google-investigation.html).
He has requested regular briefings on the department’s case, taking
thick binders of information about it on trips and vacations and
returning with ideas and notes.

The [government reported](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) on Thursday
that **** 833,000 workers filed new claims for state unemployment
benefits last week, the latest evidence that the coronavirus pandemic is
still battering the labor market.

The figure, not seasonally adjusted, represents an increase from 826,000
the previous week. The seasonally adjusted number of new state claims
last week was 881,000.

An additional **** 759,000 new claims were filed last week by unemployed
freelancers, part-time workers and others who are receiving federal
relief under a separate emergency relief program, up from 608,000 the
week before.

There has been [progress](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICNSA)from
the early weeks of the pandemic, when tallies surged past six million.
But recent improvements have been more laborious.

“I’m really concerned that the pandemic assistance claims are rising,”
said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at the forecasting firm Oxford
Economics. “Altogether you’re looking at 1.6 million filing. It’s pretty
bad at this stage in the crisis.”

“I feel like this is a very fragile labor market at a critical
juncture,” he added.

More than five months into the pandemic, the claims numbers continue to
dwarf previous records.

“It could reflect a weakening economy in some of the states worst
impacted by the health crisis,” he said, “or it could be that some of
the workers that had returned are finding that it’s not possible or
sustainable to return to their primary economic activity in the current
environment.”

More than nine million laid-off workers have been rehired. And most
analysts expect that the monthly [jobs report](https://www.bls.gov/),
scheduled for release on Friday, will show a dip in August from
double-digit unemployment rates.

There were modest reductions in new weekly claims through most of
August, an encouraging trend. But this week, comparisons to previous
announcements from the Labor Department need a flashing “WARNING”
signal.

That’s because the department has [changed the way it
adjusts](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/01/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#the-labor-department-will-start-counting-unemployment-claims-in-a-new-way)state
jobless claims figures for predictable seasonal patterns, like school
staff returning in the fall or temporary holiday workers who are laid
off in January.

With the pandemic, claims have been anything but predictable. So the
department tweaked its calculations to improve accuracy, but the change
means that the seasonally adjusted numbers released on Thursday are not
comparable with those from previous weeks.

As a result, The Times is emphasizing unadjusted figures.

What do the populations of Canada, the United States, Spain, Germany and
Australia have in common? More people in these countries say economic
conditions will improve in the next 12 months than those who say they
will worsen, according to [an international
survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/03/views-of-the-economy-have-turned-sharply-negative-in-many-countries-amid-covid-19/)
by the **Pew Research Center**.

But this optimistic outlook isn’t widely shared. In three other
countries — the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea — the majority of
the population said the situation would worsen. In the remaining six
countries surveyed, which include the U.K., Sweden, and Japan, a
plurality of respondents said the economy was more likely to get worse.
Pew said it conducted a<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0">
</span>representative survey of more than 14,000 adults between June and
early August by phone.

Reflecting the impact of [large (and often unprecedented) drops in
economic
output](https://www.oecd.org/sdd/na/gdp-growth-second-quarter-2020-oecd.htm#:~:text=Unprecedented%20fall%20in%20OECD%20GDP%20by%209.8%25%20in%20Q2%202020&text=Among%20the%20Major%20Seven%20economies,%25%2C%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom.&text=Year%2Don%2Dyear%20GDP%20growth,0.9%25%20in%20the%20previous%20quarter.)
in the second quarter, when many countries shut down businesses and
ordered people to stay at home, far more people said their national
economy was currently bad.

“Public attitudes about the economy have turned bleak in much of the
world,” Shannon Schumacher and Mara Mordecai, researchers at Pew, wrote
in the report published with the survey results on
Thursday.

People who viewed their country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic
as bad were more likely to also say the economic situation was bad, the
researchers wrote, adding that this was particularly noticeable in the
United States.

“Among Americans who say their country has responded poorly to Covid-19,
87 percent say the economy is bad, compared with half among those who
say the response went well — a 37 percentage point difference,” they
wrote.

Moving to combat its worst recession in decades, France unveiled a 100
billion euro ($118 billion) [stimulus
plan](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/plan-de-relance/lancement-plan-relance-3-septembre-2020)
Thursday aimed at restoring the battered economy to pre-crisis levels by
2022, handing companies large tax cuts and hiring subsidies in the hope
of stimulating investment and creating jobs.

“We have to learn to live with the virus, and to survive it,” Prime
Minister Jean Castex said at a press briefing. “The economy has clearly
been weakened,” he added, “and we need to relaunch it and prepare for
the future.”

The package, the biggest spending effort in Europe, comes on top of
nearly €400 billion that President Emmanuel Macron made available to
help keep thousands of business from going bankrupt and millions of
people employed since a nationwide quarantine caused the economy to
crater. Growth is expected to contract by 11 percent this year because
of the pandemic.

But a new wave of infections is rolling across France, and the prospect
of a protracted downturn has prompted the government to try to shield
the economy from further damage.

The effort focuses on supply-side stimulus and a transition to so-called
green technology across the economy, mainly by shoring up manufacturing
and infrastructure spending. Industrial companies will get €35 billion
in production tax breaks to stimulate investment and job creation, and
the state will subsidize industrial development in hard-hit regions.

Around a third of the money will go toward making the nation’s
infrastructure more environmentally sound, by upgrading major freight
and transportation train lines and renovating schools, apartment
buildings and other structures with more ecological technology. All
told, the government said it hopes to create at least 160,000 new jobs
through the stimulus measures next year.

That may not be nearly enough to ease the nation’s swelling jobless
rolls. Around 30 percent of France’s active population was [out of
work](https://think.ing.com/articles/french-unemployment-reaches-historical-highs)
in the second quarter, and economists and the government itself have
warned of [a tsunami of job losses in the
fall](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/24/business/europe-economy-layoffs.html)as
**Airbus**, **Renault** and other large companies downsize to make up
for slumping demand.

To help combat the problem, France is throwing another €6.5 billion in
subsidies at companies to encourage them to hire younger workers who are
finding it nearly impossible to get a job in a down market, and
increasing spending on job furlough and retraining programs.

The [$600-a-week federal
supplement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/29/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)
to unemployment benefits ended in July, but most states are moving ahead
with a temporary replacement: a weekly[$300
supplement](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/stimulus-unemployment-payment-benefit.html)
paid out of federal disaster relief funds.

As of Wednesday, [45 states had been
approved](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/stimulus-unemployment-payment-benefit.html)
for a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the
program. Six of those — Arizona, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee
and Texas — have started paying out benefits, according to the Labor
Department.

Most other states will probably not start payments until mid-September
or later. The supplement is expected to last four or five weeks.

South Dakota is the only state that has said it is not taking part.
[Gov. Kristi
Noem](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/16/us/elections/south-dakota-governor-turns-down-extra-unemployment-funding-saying-the-state-doesnt-need-it.html)
says her state doesn’t need the money.

A handful of states, including Kentucky, Montana and West Virginia, plan
to add $100 to the supplement.

Economists say the weekly booster is crucial to the economy’s recovery.
“The data are showing us that the expiration of the supplemental
benefits is having a clear impact on consumption,” said Carl Tannenbaum,
chief economist at Northern Trust. “As a result, the momentum of the
economic recovery seems to be slowing as we move to the end of the third
quarter.”

The big question, Mr. Tannenbaum said, is [how Congress will
react](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/business/economy/mnuchin-coronavirus.html)
to the latest evidence from the labor market and whether it will prompt
Republicans and Democrats to agree on another relief package.

“Are we going to build a bridge of sufficient length to get to the
post-Covid environment without permanent economic damage?” he asked.

## [Here’s what you need to know about the eviction moratorium.](#heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-eviction-moratorium)

</div>

The Trump administration has announced an
[order](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-19654.pdf)
to suspend the possibility of eviction for millions of renters who have
suffered financially because of the coronavirus pandemic. The [Centers
for Disease Control and
Prevention](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/business/eviction-moratorium-order.html)
said the order was an emergency action, which it is entitled to take
under the law.

We have answers to questions that renters may have about the order.
Please email your questions to <hubforhelp@NYTimes.com>.

**Who is eligible?**

You must meet a five-pronged test.

  - You need to have used your “best efforts” to obtain any and all
    forms of government rental assistance.

  - You can’t “expect” to earn more than $99,000 in 2020, or $198,000 if
    you’re married and filing a joint tax return. If you don’t qualify
    that way, you could still be eligible if you did not need to report
    any income at all to the federal government in 2019 or if you
    received a stimulus check this year.

  - You must be experiencing a “substantial” loss of household income, a
    layoff or “extraordinary” out-of-pocket medical expenses (which the
    order defines as any unreimbursed expense likely to exceed 7.5
    percent of your adjusted gross income this year).

  - You have to be making your best efforts to make “timely” partial
    payments that are as close to the full amount due as “circumstances
    may permit,” taking into account other nondiscretionary expenses.

  - Eviction would “likely” lead to either homelessness or your having
    to move to a place that was more expensive or where you could get
    sick from being close to others.

**A lot of that is pretty subjective. If it’s a close call, who
decides?**

Landlords who disagree with renters’ self-assessments could try to evict
nonpaying tenants by arguing that they are not a “covered person” within
the order’s scope and dare them to fight back legally. Then it could be
up to a housing court judge to decide if a renter is eligible or if the
landlord can, in fact, evict.

**How do I prove to my landlord that I’m eligible?**

The C.D.C. order makes reference to a declaration that renters should
draft and then provides an example of one near the end of [the
document](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-19654.pdf)
online.

  - **Amazon**
    [said](https://amazonuk.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-create-10000-new-permanent-jobs-across-uk-2020)
    Thursday that it planned to add 7,000 new permanent jobs across the
    United Kingdom this year as online shopping continues to surge. The
    new roles are in addition to the 3,000 roles already added in the
    U.K. in 2020. Amazon also said it would create more than 20,000
    seasonal jobs across the England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
    Ireland for the holiday season.

  - The amount of U.S. government debt will nearly outpace the size of
    the nation’s economy in the 2020 fiscal year, [the Congressional
    Budget Office said on
    Wednesday](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/02/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/the-federal-debt-is-on-track-to-outpace-us-economy-in-2021-budget-office-says).
    Total debt held by the public is expected to reach an estimated 98
    percent of the size of the economy for the fiscal year, which ends
    on Sept. 30, the budget office said. The budget office now expects
    the debt to exceed the size of the economy in fiscal year 2021. By
    2023, it said on Wednesday, it expects the debt as a share of the
    economy to reach its highest level in American history, surpassing
    the World War II era.

  - **United Airlines** said Wednesday that it [expects to
    furlough 16,370
    employees](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/02/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/united-airlines-is-set-to-furlough-16000-workers-in-the-fall)
    starting Oct. 1, when federal restrictions on job cuts that were a
    condition of government aid end. The announcement, which comes a
    week after a similar one from **[American
    Airlines](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/25/business/american-airline-furlough-19000.html)**,
    could put further pressure on Congress and the Trump administration
    to renew stimulus funding. The Oct. 1 cut would affect nearly 7,000
    flight attendants, nearly 3,000 pilots and thousands of others who
    work in maintenance, airport operations and other roles.
