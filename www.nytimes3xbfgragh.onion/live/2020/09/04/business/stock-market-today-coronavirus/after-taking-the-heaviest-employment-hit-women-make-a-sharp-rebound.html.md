It could be years before the central bank raises interest rates above a
“low” level, Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said
on Friday, a sign of the Fed’s steadfast view that the economy, while
slowly recovering, will need extraordinary support for an extended
amount of time given the pandemic.

His comments, [in an interview with
NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/04/909627932/feds-jerome-powell-jobless-rate-better-than-expected-recovery-to-take-a-long-tim),
were a contrast to those from the White House, which hailed Friday’s
jobs report showing the unemployment rate [dipping to 8.4
percent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/04/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#jobs-report-august-2020)
as a sign of a continued, rapid recovery from the depths of the pandemic
recession.

“The economy is now recovering,” Mr. Powell said. “But it’s going to be
a long time, we think. We think that the economy’s going to need low
interest rates, which support economic activity, for an extended period
of time. It will be measured in years.”

The Fed slashed interest rates to near zero in March and has
increasingly suggested that it is in no rush to raise them, even if the
unemployment rate drops and the labor market is running hot.

Last month, Mr. Powell announced a major shift in how the central bank
guides the economy, signaling it would make job growth pre-eminent and
would not raise interest rates to guard against expected inflation just
because the
[unemployment](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/business/economy/unemployment-claims.html)
rate is low.

“What we’ve learned is that unemployment can be even lower than we
thought and not result in troubling levels of inflation,” Mr. Powell
told NPR. Later, he added: “We’re not going to prematurely withdraw the
support that we think the economy needs.”

While Mr. Powell expressed concern over the long-run sustainability of
federal debt, which will nearly exceed the size of the economy this
fiscal year, he said now is not the moment to worry about cutting
spending and limiting borrowing. “The time to start working on fiscal
sustainability is not right now when we have so many people in need,” he
said.

  - Stocks were down sharply in early trading on Friday, but recovered
    most of their losses by the afternoon. The S\&P 500 ended the day
    down 0.8 percent after being down as much as 3 percent. The
    tech-heavy Nasdaq composite closed down 1.3 percent.

  - The S\&P started the week by marching upward and reaching another
    high on Wednesday, but ended it by sliding down 2.3 percent from
    where it had started. Given that the S\&P 500 has rallied 50 percent
    since its low in March, market analysts said **some big drops were
    almost inevitabl**e. “You knew you had one of these coming at some
    point, perhaps more than one,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment
    strategist at the Leuthold Group. “The moves upward, especially in
    the last few days, were something.”
    
    Still, the steepness of the recent declines could stoke more fear
    and further selling.

  - The continued selling occurred after a government report on Friday
    showed that the U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs in August.
    Stocks have moved steadily higher since March even as the
    pandemic-hit economy struggles to recover. The Federal Reserve and
    Congress have helped stimulate the economy, giving investors
    confidence, but some analysts say the economy has to show more
    strength to keep the rally going.

  - Tech companies hold [significant sway over the S\&P 500
    index](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/04/28/business/coronavirus-stocks.html)
    by virtue of their size. Investors have been optimistic about the
    tech firms, whose [market dominance and online business
    models](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-facebook-amazon-youtube.html)
    appear poised to benefit from the prospect of a work-from-home
    world.

  - And big tech companies helped to pull the index down: **Amazon**
    ended down 2.2 percent, and **Facebook** and **Alphabet** both fell
    about 3 percent.

  - A day earlier the S\&P 500 suffered its worst drop since June: 3.5
    percent. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down more than 800
    points.

  - Stocks had been on **a significant tear**. Before Thursday, the S\&P
    500 had been up [in nine of the last 10
    sessions](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/03/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/wall-street-has-been-on-an-extraordinary-rally-since-the-depths-of-march).

  - **European markets also fell** on Friday, and Asian markets closed
    lower after Wall Street’s plunge.

Employers continued to bring back furloughed workers last month, but at
a far slower pace than in the spring, and millions of Americans remain
out of work.

The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs in August, the Labor Department
said Friday, down from 1.7 million in July and down sharply from
[the 4.8 million added in
June](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/02/business/economy/jobs-unemployment-coronavirus.html).
Payrolls are still more than 11 million jobs below their pre-pandemic
level.

The unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent, down significantly from 14.7
percent in April and 10.2 percent in July. The drop brings the rate
below the peak of the last recession a decade ago, when unemployment
briefly hit 10 percent, but joblessness is still higher than the peak of
many past recessions.

“We still have a long way to go,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S.
economist for S\&P
Global.

The figure for August job growth [was buoyed by the hiring of close
to 240,000 temporary workers for the 2020
census](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/04/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/census-hiring-helped-increase-the-august-jobs-tally),
most of whom will be laid off when census canvassing ends later this
month. Private-sector payrolls, which were not affected by the census
hires, rose by one million in August, down from 1.5 million in July.

The report on Friday provides some of the first clear data on the state
of the economy as emergency federal spending winds down, including a
$600 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits that helped keep many
households afloat early in the pandemic. Economists warn that without
that supplement, which expired at the end of July, millions of families
will struggle to pay rent and buy food, reining in the broader economy.

  - Because the August jobs data was collected early in the month, it
    may not reflect the full impact of the loss of benefits, economists
    warn. That quirk of the calendar could have political ramifications:
    The relatively solid jobs report [could ease pressure on Congress to
    agree on a new round of emergency
    spending](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/business/economy/jobs-report.html).
    Economists warn that could set the stage for a big drop in spending
    in the fall, leading to more job losses and a [wave of
    small-business
    failures](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/business/economy/small-businesses-coronavirus.html).

  - Even as people return to work, [more are finding that layoffs are
    permanent](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/business/even-as-people-return-to-work-more-find-that-layoffs-are-permanent.html).
    In August, less than half of unemployed workers reported being on
    temporary layoff or furlough. Back in April, that figure was nearly
    80 percent. That development is the result of a combination of good
    news and bad.

  - Signs of a slowing recovery [were seen across many
    industries](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/business/augusts-slowdown-in-job-growth-spanned-many-industries.html).
    For example, the construction sector is fewer than half a million
    jobs short of its level before the pandemic, but only 16,000
    construction jobs were added in August.

The pandemic-induced downturn sent the unemployment rate for women
skyrocketing, but the figure is also falling relatively quickly as
business lockdowns ease and the job market recovers.

The unemployment rate for women 16 or older declined to 8.6 percent in
August, a [report from the Labor Department
showed](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm), down from 16.2
percent at its peak in April. Women have staged a faster rebound than
men, albeit from much worse levels.

Male
[unemployment](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LNS14000001)
fell to 8.3 percent in August, down from 13.5 percent in April. Women’s
[joblessness](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LNS14000002)
remains 5.2 percentage points above February levels, while male
joblessness is about 4.7 percentage points higher than it was before the
crisis.

Along other demographic lines, people of color continue to face a worse
job-market impact from the pandemic recession than their white
counterparts. The unemployment
[rate](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LNS14000006) for
Black workers remains the highest among large racial groups at 13
percent, which up from 5.8 percent in February.
[Asian](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LNS14032183)workers
have seen a particularly large sustained unemployment hit: Their jobless
rate is now 10.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent before lockdowns started.

For
[Hispanic](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LNS14000009)
and Latino employees, unemployment fell to 10.5 percent in August, up
from 4.4 percent in February. And for
[white](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LNS14000003)
workers, it eased to 7.3 percent in August, up from 3.1 percent before
the crisis.

When Sharmah Wardlaw lost her job as a receptionist at an Atlanta
convention center in March, she was meant to be on a temporary furlough.
But as the weeks and months went by, she was not recalled to work. Then,
on Aug. 10, the hammer fell: She got a letter from her employer telling
her she was permanently laid off.

Ms. Wardlaw, 55, had been making ends meet thanks to the $600-a-week
federal supplement to her unemployment benefits. That allowed her to pay
the $1,100 rent and other bills for her apartment in Stonecrest, Ga.,
where she lives with her 19-year-old daughter.

When the supplement ceased at the end of July, she was left with $300 a
week in state benefits. She had tucked away enough from each
unemployment check to pay her rent for August, but not for September. So
in mid-August, she withdrew $25,000 from her 401(k) account to pay her
coming bills.

Then, on a whim last Sunday, she bought three lottery tickets, all with
the same number. She woke up on Tuesday to the news that all of her
tickets were winners. She had won $15,000 — enough to pay her rent
through the end of the year.

That stroke of luck changed everything.

“I can breathe a sigh of relief,” she said. “If I hadn’t won, I’d be
draining my retirement savings to pay my rent.”

Ms. Wardlaw hopes to find a new job before the lottery money runs out.

Hourly wage growth remained high in August, as shifts in the composition
of the labor force that have been distorting the figures continued to
muddle the numbers.

While wage data in the United States have risen rapidly during much of
the pandemic era, the trend reflects a statistical quirk. Workers at the
lower end of the earning spectrum have disproportionately lost jobs,
taking smaller data points out of the pool and pushing up the overall
average in what economists call a “compositional shift.”

“The large employment fluctuations over the past several months —
especially in industries with lower-paid workers — complicate the
analysis of recent trends in average hourly earnings,” the Labor
Department report said.

Average hourly wages were 4.7 percent higher in August than they were a
year earlier. That is slightly weaker than the July figure, but still
sharply elevated from the 3.3 percent average gain for the data series
in 2019.

On the ground, the wage story has been complicated, based on anecdotal
evidence. While some employees have received hazard pay for coming to
the workplace while infection remains a risk, others have taken wage
cuts as companies tried to avoid furloughing workers even as revenues
sank. Employers have at times reporting raising pay to compete with
expanded unemployment insurance, which [lapsed in late
July](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/27/business/since-a-600-a-week-benefit-lapsed-her-savings-have-been-dwindling.html).

“A number of staffing agencies reported that before enhanced
unemployment benefits had expired, the benefits motivated them to raise
wages to attract workers,” according to the Federal Reserve’s [Beige
Book business
survey](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202009.htm)
for August, based on interviews from the Cleveland district. In the
Philadelphia area, companies reported retaining so-called “hero” pay,
while some in the Atlanta region reported rescinding salary cuts even as
others made them permanent.

The share of Americans who are either working or looking for a job
continued to rebound in August as the labor market heals from the depths
of the pandemic recession.

The labor force participation rate increased to 61.7 percent, [a
report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) from the Labor
Department showed, up from 61.4 percent the prior month and roughly in
line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

The rate is down from 63.4 percent in February, before the
pandemic-induced downturn.

Economists closely watch participation measures, which provide a more
complete picture of labor market strength than the jobless rate alone. A
rise in the unemployment rate that happens because more people have
chosen to look for work can actually be a sign that job market prospects
are improving, for example. That participation is rising even as
joblessness falls signals that the job market is staging a genuine
rebound.

A closely watched measure of [labor
force](https://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LNS11300060)
attachment among prime-working-age Americans, the participation rate for
those 25 to 54 years old had been holding roughly steady over recent
months. It stood at 81.4 percent in August, little changed from 81.3
percent in July. That is better than the recent low of 79.9 percent in
April, but still down sharply from 83 percent before the crisis.

A long rebound in prime-age participation before the pandemic had been a
bright spot in the broader U.S. labor market performance.

The British economy has rebounded faster than expected out of its
[deepest recession on
record](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/12/business/britain-economy-recession-coronavirus.html),
but the circumstances that let that happen are already disappearing, a
central banker warned.

It is “quite likely” that the U.K. will need more monetary stimulus,
Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s interest
rate-setting committee,[said in a speech on
Friday](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2020/michael-saunders-speech-the-economy-and-covid-19-looking-back-and-looking-forward).

“The economy in June, July and August has benefited from a relatively
benign confluence of factors,” Mr. Saunders said. Government spending
and other fiscal support were very high, while the easing of lockdown
restrictions boosted spending. “Even that very limited sweet spot may
now be fading,” he said.

[Coronavirus infection
rates](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/21/world/europe/coronavirus-second-wave.html)
in the U.K. and Europe are rising again, and consumer confidence has
stalled, Mr. Saunders added. Meanwhile, the government’s plans to roll
back spending measures will reduce net fiscal support to an average of
£15 billion ($19.9 billion) in each of the next two quarters, about 2
to 3 percent of gross domestic product. Between April and June, fiscal
stimulus amounted to 19 percent of G.D.P.

“I do not interpret the economy’s recovery in the last few months as a
strong signal that further upside surprises lie ahead,” Mr. Saunders
said.

Earlier this week, [two other
policymakers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/02/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus#bank-of-england-policymakers-warn-of-even-more-economic-damage-than-is-forecast)
said the British economy might experience longer-term impacts and a
slower recovery than the central bank had most recently forecast.

The editors and reporters for the [DealBook
newsletter](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/business/dealbook/stock-markets-tech.html)
sift through a lot of company reports and listen to many earnings
conference calls. These are some of the things that caught our notice
this week:

🥫 “We all knew that there would be a pivot eventually back to healthier
recipes … a little more comfort-oriented initially, a little more
healthier now.” *— Mark Clouse,* ***Campbell Soup****’s chief executive*

⚠️ “A large portion of the demand is driven by folks who are just
fearful of their personal protection and safety, starting with the
pandemic and moving on to the civil unrest.” *— Mark Smith, the*
***Smith & Wesson*** *chief executive*

😷 “Yesterday I bought a good amount of spectacular Christmas-decorated
KN95 masks. So hopefully those masks will encourage people to get close
and hug their families while still protecting themselves.” *— Michael

💻 **Zoom** reported [a huge rise in

this week, generating effusive praise from analysts on its conference
call, including “another incredible quarter,” “a truly outstanding
quarter” and “another just phenomenal quarter.” Others thanked the
videoconferencing company for more fundamental reasons:

  - “Just thank you for keeping everybody connected.” *— Heather Bellini
    of* ***Goldman Sachs***

  - “I echo my congratulations and gratitude all around, and it’s nice
    to see everybody.” *— Brad Zelnick of* ***Credit Suisse***

  - “First, I want to say thank you from the analyst community and as a
    parent, as a husband. Yes, you’ve made a substantive difference in
    all our lives.” *— Alex Zukin of* ***RBC Capital Markets***

  - A bankruptcy judge signed off on **Neiman Marcus**’ restructuring
    plan on Friday, marking the end of one of the first major
    [bankruptcy filings during the Covid-19
    pandemic](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/05/07/business/neiman-marcus-bankruptcy.html),
    which has caused a wave of major retailers to seek Chapter 11

    Kamensky](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/03/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus/a-hedge-fund-manager-is-accused-of-securities-fraud-related-to-the-neiman-marcus-bankruptcy)
    with fraud for suppressing a competing bid for a piece of the
    bankrupt retailer.

  - **Virgin Atlantic** said it planned to cut another 1,150 jobs as the
    airline received court approval for its 1.2 billion euro private
    rescue deal this week. It brings the total job losses since May to
    4,700, or nearly half of the airline’s work force. Virgin also plans
    to put 600 cabin crew on a company-financed furlough program.

  - **FedEx** said Thursday that [it plans to hire 70,000 U.S.

    and reliant on online shopping — and package delivery. That’s a 27
    percent increase from last year, when the company brought on 55,000
    workers to prepare for the holidays. FedEx also
    [announced](https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/fedex-enhancements-position-company-ahead-of-a-record-setting-peak-season/)plans
