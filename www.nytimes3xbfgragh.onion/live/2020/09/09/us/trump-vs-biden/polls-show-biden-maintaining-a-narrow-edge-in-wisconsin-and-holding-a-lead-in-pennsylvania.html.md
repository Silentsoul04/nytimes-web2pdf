President Trump acknowledged to the journalist Bob Woodward [that he had
knowingly played down the coronavirus earlier this
year](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/politics/woodward-trump-book-virus.html)
even though he was aware it was “deadly” and vastly more serious than
the seasonal flu.

“This is deadly stuff,” Mr. Trump said on Feb. 7 in one of a series of
interviews Mr. Woodward conducted with the president for his upcoming
book, “Rage.” [The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump/2020/09/09/0368fe3c-efd2-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html)
and
[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/09/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump-coronavirus/index.html)
were given advance copies of the book and published details on
Wednesday. CNN also [provided audio of some of Mr. Trump’s
exchanges](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/09/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump-coronavirus/index.html)
with Mr. Woodward.

“You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” Mr. Trump said.
“And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s
also more deadly than even your strenuous flu.”

That was a vastly different story than Mr. Trump was telling the public.
In early March the president was suggesting on Twitter that the virus
was less deadly than the flu.

<div class="css-nj25e3">

> between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the

</div>

“I wanted to always play it down,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Woodward on March
19. “I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a
panic.”

Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, [excoriated the
president over the
report](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/politics/biden-trump-michigan-jobs-taxes.html).
“He knew and purposely played it down,” Mr. Biden said during a speech
in Warren, Mich., Wednesday afternoon. “Worse, he lied to the American
people.”

Mr. Trump did not deny the report in remarks at the White House later
Wednesday. “The fact is I’m a cheerleader for this country,” he said,
taking credit for imposing restrictions on travel from China. He said
that he was trying to “show confidence” with his public statements and
rejected the suggestion that publicly minimizing the threat of the virus
had cost lives.

He acknowledged speaking with Mr. Woodward, whose regular books on
presidential administrations have a propensity for making news. “I gave
him some quotes, and frankly, we’ll see how the book turned out,” Mr.
Trump said. “I have no idea.”

According to the book, the national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien,
warned the president on Jan. 28 that the coronavirus represented the
“biggest national security threat” of his presidency, CNN reported,
but Mr. Trump later said he did not remember the warning.

At the White House press briefing on Wednesday, shortly after the book’s
contents were made public in news reports, the press secretary, Kayleigh
McEnany, claimed that the president, who intentionally misled the public
about the virus, had not lied.

![<span class="css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0">The White House press secretary,
Kayleigh McEnany, defended President Trump when asked whether he
knowingly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, as reported in a new
book.</span><span class="css-cch8ym"><span class="css-1dv1kvn">Credit</span><span class="css-cnj6d5 e1z0qqy90" itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span class="css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0">Credit...</span><span>Doug

“This president does what leaders do, good leaders,” she said, adding,
“The president has never lied to the American public on Covid.”

But in public, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed early on that the virus
would disappear. On Jan. 22, asked by a CNBC reporter whether there were
“worries about a pandemic,” the president replied: “No, not at all. We
have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and
we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”

On Feb. 10 he was
[predicting](https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-kag-rally-manchester-new-hampshire-february-10-2020)
that by April, “when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes
away.” And on Feb. 26, at a White House news conference, commenting on
the country’s first reported cases, he said: “We’re going to be pretty
soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over
the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck.”

But by mid-March [he was claiming publicly
that](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html)
“I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.” By
then, experts said, the nation had already fallen behind on the steps it
needed to take to combat the virus, from ramping up testing capability
to distributing protective gear to health care workers.

Elsewhere in the book, according to CNN, the former defense secretary,
Gen. James Mattis, is quoted calling Mr. Trump “dangerous” and “unfit.”
He said he discussed with the former director of the office of national
intelligence, Dan Coats, whether there should be “collective action” to
speak out publicly against Mr. Trump. And Mr. Woodward includes an
anecdote about Mr. Trump [being heard in a meeting
saying](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/09/us/politics/trump-generals-attacks.html),
“My fucking generals are a bunch of pussies” who care more about
alliances than trade deals.

WARREN, Mich. — Joseph R. Biden Jr., taking on President Trump over
protecting American jobs, announced plans on Wednesday to change the tax
code to discourage moving jobs overseas and to reward companies for
investing in domestic production.

But before sketching out his plan, during a speech in the critical
battleground state of Michigan, he took aim at Mr. Trump over [new
revelations](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/live/2020/09/09/us/trump-vs-biden/trump-admitted-to-bob-woodward-that-he-intentionally-played-down-the-threat-of-the-coronavirus)
from a forthcoming book by the journalist Bob Woodward that the
president knowingly minimized the risks of the coronavirus to the
American public.

“He had the information,” Mr. Biden said, accusing Mr. Trump of lying to
the public. “He knew how dangerous it was. And while this deadly disease
ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a
life-and-death betrayal of the American people.”

“It’s beyond despicable,” Mr. Biden added, detailing the crises the
nation faces as a result of the pandemic that go far beyond the
staggering public health costs. “It’s a dereliction of duty. It’s a
disgrace.”

During an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Biden used even sharper
language to criticize Mr. Trump’s contradictory message about the
gravity of the pandemic.

“It was all about making sure the stock market didn’t come down, that
his wealthy friends didn’t lose any money,” [Mr. Biden
said](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1303811690371444750). “He waved
a white flag. He walked away. He didn’t do a damn thing. Think about it.
Think about what he did not do. It’s almost criminal.”

In his speech, Mr. Biden ripped into the president’s record on the
economy, suggesting that Mr. Trump has not kept his promises to American
workers about a range of issues, lashing his record on matters from job
creation to keeping work in the United States rather than overseas.

“He’s failed our economy and our country,” he said.

Mr. Biden also promised to take a series of executive actions to ensure
the purchase of American goods in the federal procurement process.

As part of the new plans, Mr. Biden would create a tax penalty aimed at
American companies that move jobs to other countries, known as
offshoring. Mr. Biden has already proposed raising the corporate tax
rate to 28 percent, from 21 percent. The penalty would apply to “profits
of any production by a United States company overseas for sales back to
the United States,” bumping up the tax rate to nearly 31 percent on
those profits.

Mr. Biden would also create a tax credit for companies that make
domestic investments, such as revitalizing closed manufacturing plants,
upgrading facilities or bringing back production from overseas.

“Make it in Michigan, make it in America, invest in our communities and
the workers in places like Warren,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s what this is
about.”

Mr. Biden gave his speech in Warren, a city in [Macomb
County](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2016/11/13/us/politics/michigan-voters-donald-trump.html)
— a place associated with white working-class voters who traditionally
voted Democratic but embraced Ronald Reagan and, later, Mr. Trump. He
has intensified his efforts in recent months to unveil more [populist
policies](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/07/09/us/politics/biden-buy-american.html)
aimed at boosting American workers.

Thomas Kaplan reported from Warren, and Katie Glueck from New York.

President Trump revealed a list of 20 people he will consider nominating
to the Supreme Court if he wins a second term, reviving an election-year
gimmick that he used during the 2016 campaign to win support among
conservatives.

Mr. Trump’s new list includes three conservative Republican senators:
Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri.
(Mr. Hawley immediately took himself out of consideration, [writing on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1303787915668074497?s=20)
that “as I told the President, Missourians elected me to fight for them
in the Senate, and I have no interest in the high court.”) It also
includes lawyers who work at the White House and the Justice Department,
former solicitors general, and state and federal judges around the
country.

“Should there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my
presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the
American public,” Mr. Trump said, adding that he will consider the
remaining names from a similar list he released during the previous
election.

Mr. Trump challenged Joseph R. Biden Jr. to release a similar list of
names and accused him of failing to do so because of the “extreme”
ideology that would be represented by his choices.

Minutes after he was named to the list, Senator Cotton wrote on Twitter
that “It’s time for Roe v. Wade to go,” weighing in directly on abortion
rights, an issue that past nominees to the court have often tried to
finesse.

<div class="css-nj25e3">

> It's time for Roe v. Wade to go.

> [September 9, 2020](https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1303786807692124160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

</div>

Speaking to reporters from the Diplomatic Reception Room in the White
House, Mr. Trump predicted that the next president might have the
opportunity to nominate “one, two, three and even four” justices.

He said that a Democratic president would stack the court with a
“radical left movement” that would be bad for the country.

During his four years in office, Mr. Trump has successfully secured the
confirmation of two Supreme Court justices — Neil Gorsuch and Brett
Kavanaugh — and more than 200 other federal judges, significantly
shifting the judiciary to the right.

In addition to the senators, Mr. Trump’s new list includes: Daniel
Cameron, the attorney general of Kentucky; Paul Clement and Noel
Francisco, who both served as United States solicitor general; Kate
Comerford Todd, a deputy counsel in the White House; Christopher Landau,
the ambassador to Mexico; and several federal and state judges.

Democratic congressional leaders sent a letter to colleagues on
Wednesday pleading with them to urge their constituents to vote as early
as possible, citing [their
concerns](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/31/us/postal-service-dejoy-subpoena.html)
that President Trump, with the help of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy,
is working to kneecap the Postal Service to ensure his own re-election.

“Democrats need to convey a loud, clear message to voters about how to
overcome these concerns: To prevent Donald Trump from stealing this
election, VOTE,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the
minority leader, wrote in an unusual letter sent from a campaign account
rather than an official one. “Americans must vote as early as they can —
especially if you plan to vote by mail.”

Mr. Trump has railed against mail-in voting, claiming that it will rig
the election against him and asserting [with no
evidence](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html)
that it is fraudulent. At the same time, Mr. DeJoy, installed in June by
a [board packed with Republican
loyalists](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/us/politics/democrats-postal-service-board-trump.html),
has made operational changes at the Postal Service that have coincided
with a mail-delivery slowdown.

The agency [recently warned
states](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/08/14/us/politics/usps-vote-mail.html)
that it might not have the ability to process all last-minute ballots,
opening the possibility that hundreds of thousands mailed in the days
leading up to the election could arrive too late to be counted. It has
started a public education campaign to reassure Americans that the
Postal Service can handle voting by mail and to urge those who plan to
do so to send their ballots early. But its ads stop short of encouraging
mail-in voting.

In their letter, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer encouraged Democratic
lawmakers to direct their constituents to
[iwillvote.com](http://iwillvote.com/), a website funded by the
Democratic National Committee where people can register to vote and find
out how to do so in person or by mail.

“The best way to avoid lines, obstacles and delays is by not waiting
until Election Day to vote,” they wrote. “Stay vigilant: With President
Trump actively working to undermine the legitimacy of voting by mail, we
must remain vigilant against efforts to discourage or deceive voters.”

</div>

Should Bob Woodward have withheld a February quote from President Trump,
who privately told him the coronavirus was “deadly stuff” even as he
publicly minimized its severity? Could Mr. Woodward have helped save
lives by releasing the information sooner?

The revelation of Mr. Trump’s characterization of the virus came
Wednesday with the first reports about Mr. Woodward’s new book, “Rage,”
which is due out next week. Mr. Trump shared the information in an
interview with Mr. Woodward for the book about his presidency. It
prompted a larger debate around journalistic ethics, with some arguing
that Mr. Woodward, a lion of American journalism, had an obligation to
report or share Mr. Trump’s assessment sooner.

In the hours after CNN and The Washington Post, which were given advance
access to the book, reported the quotations, many observers argued that
the public had a right not only to the information about the deadly
potential of the virus early on but also to the fact that Mr. Trump had
been told the truth by experts and yet continued to mislead Americans.
An often cited example is his comments in March comparing the
coronavirus favorably to the seasonal flu.

It is estimated that the toll of Covid-19, the illness caused by the
coronavirus, will soon reach 200,000 lives in the United States.

“Trump was the key vector of harmful misinformation,”
[said](https://twitter.com/marcambinder/status/1303829709902372864) Marc
Ambinder, a former White House correspondent for National Journal, on
Twitter. “We KNOW that his supporters BELIEVE HIM and altered their
behavior because they thought COVID would be less harmful then the flu …
cause that’s what Trump said.”

He added, “I’m inclined to say that holding onto this is and was flat
out wrong.”

<div class="css-nj25e3">

</div>

Others defended Mr. Woodward. “If you believe that Woodward publishing
Trump’s quote in March would’ve changed anything on Coronavirus the last
four years have taught you absolutely nothing,” said James Ball, the
global editor of The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, on Twitter.

</div>

Mr. Woodward did not reply to requests for comment Wednesday evening.

While it is common for journalists and book authors to agree to hold
back information or comments from sources until an agreed-upon date, Mr.
Woodward
[told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/should-bob-woodward-have-reported-trumps-virus-revelations-sooner-heres-how-he-defends-his-decision/2020/09/09/6bd7fc32-f2d1-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html)
Margaret Sullivan, The Post’s media columnist, on Wednesday that there
was no such deal in place.

Rather, Mr. Woodward said, he declined to share the comment in February
or March because he did not learn until May that it had come from an
intelligence briefing. By then, he
[told](https://apnews.com/99916044401d8f8e24eb7bedfec1d5d2) The
Associated Press on Wednesday, the quote’s significance pertained to
politics rather than public health, and the relevant deadline was the
November election.

His ultimate goal, he told Ms. Sullivan, was to produce “the best
obtainable version of the truth.”

Mr. Woodward has chronicled several presidents since the 1970s, when,
with his Post colleague Carl Bernstein, he helped expose the Watergate
scandal that led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation. Though he
has the title of associate editor at The Post, he is no longer a Post
employee, a spokeswoman confirmed.

With just eight weeks to go until Election Day, and early voting
starting well before then, voters continue to disapprove of President
Trump’s coronavirus response and believe that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would
do a better job handling the pandemic, according to [a new
poll](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_090920/)
from Monmouth University.

Only 37 percent of registered voters say Mr. Trump has done a good job
handling the virus, and 56 percent say he has done a bad job. More
broadly, only 27 percent say the country is heading in the right
direction.

Forty-four percent say they are confident or somewhat confident that Mr.
Trump can put the country “on the road to recovery” from the pandemic,
and 56 percent say they are not confident. The numbers are reversed for
Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee: 53 percent of voters say they are
confident in his ability to put the country on the road to recovery, and
45 percent say they are not confident.

A wide partisan gap persists on the question of whether officials are
lifting restrictions too quickly or not quickly enough, but over all, 58
percent of registered voters said states were moving too fast.

“Labor Day generally serves as a marker for returning to a more normal
flow of life,” Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University
Polling Institute, said in a news release. “That’s not happening this
year and could be leading to an increase in anxiety levels.”

The poll, conducted from Sept. 3 to Sept. 8, surveyed 867 voters and has
a margin of error of roughly plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health,
took issue on Wednesday with President Trump’s suggestion that a
coronavirus vaccine [would be available by Election
Day](https://patch.com/us/white-house/trump-says-coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-october),
as he repeatedly sought to reassure senators and the public that a
vaccine would not be made available to the public unless it was safe and
effective.

“Certainly to try to predict whether it happens on a particular week
before or after a particular date in early November is well beyond
anything that any scientist right now could tell you and be confident
they know what they are saying,” Dr. Collins told the Senate Committee
on Health, Education Labor and Pensions at a hearing on the effort to
find a vaccine.

Dr. Collins is the latest leading medical expert to throw cold water on
Mr. Trump’s prediction. Last Thursday, the chief adviser for the White
House vaccine program, Moncef Slaoui, said it was “extremely unlikely
but not impossible” that a vaccine could be available by the end of
October. And on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci [said the same
thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/08/coronavirus-vaccine-dr-fauci-says-its-unlikely-it-will-be-ready-by-us-election.html),
saying that it was more likely that a vaccine could be ready by the end
of the year.

Wednesday’s hearing came amid growing concern over whether Americans
would be reluctant to take a coronavirus vaccine, and whether the
president would apply political pressure on his administration to
quickly approve one to give him a boost in his re-election bid against
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

On Tuesday, a group of drug companies competing with one another to
develop vaccines
[pledged](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion%2F2020%2F09%2F08%2Fhealth%2F9-drug-companies-pledge-coronavirus-vaccine.html)
that they would not release any vaccines that did not follow rigorous
efficacy and safety standards, and a leading vaccine developer,
AstraZeneca, [suspended its large-scale clinical
tria](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/08/health/coronavirus-astrazeneca-vaccine-safety.html)l
of a vaccine candidate after a patient experienced a severe adverse
reaction.

Democrats on the panel grilled both Dr. Collins and Jerome Adams, the
surgeon general, on the effect of Mr. Trump’s overly rosy statements
about the prospect of the vaccine, and whether they would erode trust in
the development process. Dr. Collins demurred, however, as Senator
Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachussetts, asked him point blank
whether Mr. Trump’s misinformation would discourage people from taking
the vaccine and hurt the effort to distribute it.

“I’m not sure I know the answer to that question,” Dr. Collins said,
adding, “I just hope Americans will choose to take the information they
need from scientists and not from politicians.”

An aviation company in Nevada on Wednesday withdrew its invitation to
President Trump to hold a 5,000-person rally at its airport hangar, the
first of two campaign events planned for this weekend that officials
said would have violated Nevada’s coronavirus restrictions.

The company, Hangar 9 L.L.C., had planned to host Mr. Trump on Saturday
at its hangar at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport, but was told on
Tuesday by airport officials that the event would have violated the
terms of its lease, according to a letter sent by the airport authority.

The lease stipulates that the company must comply with all applicable
state laws and directives, which means it has to follow a statewide
order signed in May by Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, [limiting
gatherings to no more than 50
people](http://gov.nv.gov/News/Press/2020/Governor_Sisolak_Releases_Prepared_Remarks,_Guidance_for_Phase_2_Reopening,_Plans_Press_Call/),
airport officials said.

“Given the above, you are hereby advised that you may not proceed with
the proposed gathering,” Tina Iftiger, a senior vice president and chief
commercial officer of the airport, wrote.

Claude R. Cognian, a representative of Hangar 9, told airport officials
on Wednesday that the company could not risk losing the lease for its
hangar and would stand down, according to correspondence obtained by The
New York Times.

“Then this leaves us with no other option than to communicate to
President Trump and his campaign that we cannot help him/them and we are
withdrawing the offer to use the hangar,” he wrote.

The Trump campaign had been scheduled to hold a similar rally on Sunday
at a private jet charter company based at McCarran International Airport
in Las Vegas, but an airport spokesman said that the authorities must
approve any events on the property and that they had never received a
request from the organizers.

The charter company that had been listed as the host of the event,
Cirrus Aviation, did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Trump, who lost Nevada by less than three percentage points in 2016,
still plans to travel to the state this weekend, according to
representatives of his campaign. They [accused Democrats of
short-circuiting the
rallies](https://twitter.com/AdamLaxalt/status/1303725097816076290?s=20).

“Democrats are trying to keep President Trump from speaking to voters
because they know the enthusiasm behind his re-election campaign cannot
be matched by Joe Biden,” Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman,
said.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Sisolak said that the governor’s office had no
involvement or communication with the event organizers or potential
hosts of the two events, which the Trump campaign had been promoting.
She noted that the White House’s coronavirus task force had recommended
limits on gatherings in Nevada.

Mr. Trump has been broadly criticized by public health authorities for
defying guidelines meant to stop the transmission of the virus. He held
a large indoor rally in June in Tulsa, Okla., and has recently been
holding outdoor rallies at airport hangars: At one in North Carolina
this week, he spoke before a large crowd and did not wear a mask,
despite pleas from [some local Republican
officials](https://journalnow.com/news/local/president-trump-should-wear-a-mask-during-his-visit-to-winston-salem-county-republican-says/article_551be240-ee3c-11ea-aaac-07490e3d44da.html#1)
that he follow the state’s guidelines.

Two national political conventions and days of protests and unrest
following a police shooting in Kenosha, Wis., have done little to change
the contours of the presidential campaign in that state, according to[a
Marquette Law School poll](https://law.marquette.edu/poll/) released
Wednesday.

The new poll, of 688 likely Wisconsin voters, found that 47 percent
planned to vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and 43 percent for President
Trump, which is within the poll’s margin of error. That represented a
slight tightening from earlier Marquette polls: One in early August
showed Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump, 49 percent to 44 percent. The new
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

“Despite all those real-world events, there is very little change in
this poll,” Charles Franklin, Marquette’s poll director, said [in a
video accompanying the
release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd5LNhdapy0&feature=youtu.be).

The poll was made public as Wisconsin, a swing state that helped elect
Mr. Trump in 2016, became the center of the campaign in recent days.
Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden traveled to Kenosha after the police
shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, led to days of protests, and a
17-year-old white man was arrested on charges of killing two protesters.
The new poll was conducted from Aug. 30 to Sept. 3, so it did not fully
reflect the impact of their visits.

A majority — 54 percent — of respondents said that they disapproved of
Mr. Trump’s handling of protests, while only 36 percent said they
approved, the poll found. And 56 percent said that they disapproved of
Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus. But Mr. Trump is still viewed
favorably on the economy: Fifty-two percent said that they approved of
his handling of it.

A new poll of another key battleground state, Pennsylvania, showed Mr.
Biden in the lead there. The [NBC News/Marist
poll](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NBC-News_Marist-Poll_PA-Written-Summary-of-Findings_2009081204.pdf)
found Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump among likely voters by 53 percent to
44 percent.

Mr. Biden’s lead there was due in part to strong support from suburban
voters — which were key to Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 — and voters with
college degrees, according to the poll of 771 likely Pennsylvania
voters, which was conducted from Aug. 31 to Sept. 7. Mr. Biden leads Mr.
Trump among suburban voters by nearly 20 percentage points.

Among independents, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump 57 percent to 35 percent.
The two are tied with white voters, but Mr. Biden has a commanding lead
among nonwhite voters, 75 percent to 19 percent. Mr. Biden also leads
among women, 59 percent to 38 percent.

The poll has a margin of error of about four percentage points.

President Trump’s re-election campaign and the Republican National
Committee and their shared committees reported raising over $210 million
in the month of August, a large amount that was nonetheless dwarfed by
what Joseph R. Biden Jr. raised in the same time frame.

And officials declined to say how much cash they have in the bank, which
is a key marker of what they can spend on going forward.

Mr. Biden and affiliated Democratic committees [reported raising $364.5
million in
August](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/01/us/politics/biden-trump-fundraising-election.html).
They also have not yet said how much they have in cash on hand.

The momentum for Mr. Biden’s campaign in fund-raising and the polls came
as a [once-seemingly insurmountable cash advantage for Mr. Trump’s
campaign has
evaporated](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/07/us/politics/trump-election-campaign-fundraising.html).

## [Biden ad looks to keep focus on Trump’s reported remarks disparaging American soldiers.](#biden-ad-looks-to-keep-focus-on-trumps-reported-remarks-disparaging-american-soldiers)

</div>

Usually, presidential campaign TV advertising aims to influence voters
in battleground states. But in the Trump era, more ads are targeting a
far narrower audience: Washington’s chattering class and President
Trump, America’s cable news watcher-in-chief.

On Wednesday morning, the Democratic National Committee and the
presidential campaign of Joseph R. Biden Jr. bought TV airtime in
Washington to debut an ad touting report last week in The Atlantic that
[Mr. Trump privately referred to American
soldiers](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2020/09/04/us/politics/trump-veterans-losers.html)
killed in combat as “losers” and “suckers.”

<div class="css-nj25e3">

> NEW AD: Trump inherited everything and sacrificed nothing — as
> commander-in-chief, he denigrates service members who’ve made the
> ultimate sacrifice for our country.

### <span>The Message</span>

Since [The Atlantic’s
story](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/)
broke last Thursday, the Biden campaign has done whatever it can to give
it oxygen. Mr. Biden addressed it in a speech on Friday and brought it
up again during a Labor Day event. His campaign has sent fund-raising
emails soliciting donations off the president’s comments and circulated
other news outlets’ reporting confirming the gist of the original
report.

Now, six days after it first popped, the Biden campaign is trying to
keep the story in Washington’s bloodstream.

The 60-second ad opens with black-and-white footage of soldiers and a
reminder that 1,800 Marines died at the battle of Belleau Wood in World
War I.

“But when Donald Trump was asked to pay his respects, he said, ‘Why
should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers,’” the ad intones,
with an on-screen graphic citing The Atlantic’s reporting.

The ad goes on to cite Mr. Trump’s remarks calling Senator John McCain
“a loser” and his wondering aloud “what was in it for” those buried at
Arlington National Cemetery, before stating, “Donald Trump inherited
everything, sacrificed nothing, scoffs at the valor of those who gave it
all for America.”

### <span>Fact Check</span>

Mr. Trump did in fact call Mr. McCain a “loser” and said of Mr. McCain
[during a July 2015 campaign
stop](https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2015/07/19/us/politics/trump-belittles-mccains-war-record.html)
in Iowa: “He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured.
I like people who weren’t captured.”

Mr. Trump and his top White House aides have denied The Atlantic report,
but the thrust of it has been confirmed by [several
competing](https://apnews.com/b823f2c285641a4a09a96a0b195636ed) [news
organizations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-said-us-soldiers-injured-and-killed-in-war-were-losers-magazine-reports/2020/09/03/6e1725cc-ee35-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html),
[including Fox
News](https://video.foxnews.com/v/6187968200001#sp=show-clips), and no
current senior military officer has refuted it.

### <span>Where It’s Running</span>

So far, just once: in Washington during the 6 a.m. hour of “Morning Joe”
on MSNBC, an hour at which Mr. Trump is known to be channel surfing. A
Democratic National Committee official said the ad would also air in
Arizona, Florida, Maine, North Carolina and Virginia.

### <span>The Takeaway</span>

Every day that the presidential campaign is about Mr. Trump and not Mr.
Biden is a good one for the Biden campaign. Mr. Trump’s remarks about
America’s veterans have been Topic A in Washington for nearly a week
now, and the Biden campaign is happy to keep the conversation going.

## [The go-to Republican election lawyer called Trump’s claims of voting fraud ‘unsustainable.’](#the-go-to-republican-election-lawyer-called-trumps-claims-of-voting-fraud-unsustainable)

</div>

Benjamin L. Ginsberg is one of the top election lawyers in the nation,
the go-to attorney for Republicans in nearly every major election law
battle over the past 38 years — most famously, the Florida recount in
2000 in the disputed presidential race between George W. Bush and Al
Gore. Mr. Ginsberg won that one. His reputation as an expert in this
(often deliberately) complicated field of law crosses party lines.

Which makes an [op-ed that Mr. Ginsberg wrote in The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/08/republicans-have-insufficient-evidence-call-elections-rigged-fraudulent/)
striking. Mr. Ginsberg — who perhaps not coincidentally has the freedom
that comes from having just retired from his law firm — flatly disputed
President Trump’s assertions that mail-in voting is “very dangerous” and
that “there is tremendous fraud involved and tremendous illegality.”

“The lack of evidence renders these claims unsustainable,” Mr. Ginsberg
wrote. “The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting,
there’s no proof of widespread fraud. At most, there are isolated
incidents — by both Democrats and Republicans. Elections are not
rigged.”

These are “painful conclusions for me to reach,” Mr. Ginsberg said,
noting his own work in a catalog of redistricting and voter recount
cases on behalf of his party, and that he served as the counsel to the
Republican National Committee and to four of the past six Republican
presidential nominees.

“The president’s rhetoric has put my party in the position of a
firefighter who deliberately sets fires to look like a hero putting them
out,” he wrote. “Republicans need to take a hard look before advocating
laws that actually do limit the franchise of otherwise qualified voters.
Calling elections ‘fraudulent’ and results ‘rigged’ with almost
nonexistent evidence is antithetical to being the ‘rule of law’ party.”

How significant is this? Well, imagine if Jerry Brown, the former
Democratic governor of California and longtime environmental warrior,
wrote an op-ed for The Sacramento Bee arguing that global warming
doesn’t exist.
