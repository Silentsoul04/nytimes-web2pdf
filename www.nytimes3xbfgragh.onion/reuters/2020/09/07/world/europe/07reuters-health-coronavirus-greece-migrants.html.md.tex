ATHENS --- Greece has registered at least 17 cases of coronavirus in the
overcrowded migrant camp of Moria on the island of Lesbos so far, a
migration ministry official said on Monday.

Last week, the facility was placed under quarantine after authorities
confirmed that a 40-year-old asylum-seeker had tested positive for the
coronavirus.

So far, 1,600 tests have been conducted in Moria, Migration Minister
Notis Mitarachi told Alpha TV.

Since March 1, all migrants reaching Lesbos have been quarantined away
from the island's camps.

The Moria facility, which hosts more than 12,000 people - more than four
times its stated capacity - has been frequently criticised by aid groups
for poor living conditions. Most recently, aid groups have warned that
social distancing and basic hygiene measures are impossible to implement
in the camp due to the conditions.

Late on Monday, Greek authorities said that three more migrant
facilities had been quarantined: the Eleonas camp in Athens, the
Malakasa camp just north of Athens and the facility in Schisto, near the
port of Pireaus.

Greece has recently seen a surge in coronavirus cases. It has recorded
11,524 cases since the first infection surfaced in February, and 284
COVID-related deaths.
