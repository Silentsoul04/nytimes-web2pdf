Amid the current efforts to remove the Confederate flag as a symbol from
state and federal buildings and to divest from its commercial
circulation as a product and commodity, it is also important to remember
that a host of products lining grocery store shelves to this day,
including Aunt Jemima Pancake Mix and Aunt Jemima Syrup, are also very
much linked to Southern racism.

\begin{quote}
In 1923, the United Daughters of the Confederacy actually wanted to
erect a monument to this plantation myth embodied by Aunt Jemima.
\end{quote}

Families, including children, still encounter Aunt Jemima on trips to
the grocery store where products are marketed under this trademark by
the Quaker Oats Company in the 21st century. Numerous writings have
examined the development of the Aunt Jemima logo
\href{//www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/nancy-green-original-aunt-jemima}{in
1889} by Chris L. Rutt and Charles G. Underwood for their ready-made
pancake flour mix at the Pearl Milling Company; the logo's inspiration
by Billy Kersands' minstrel song
``\href{https://books.google.com/books?id=kPJZTJtz1IwC\&pg=PA107\&dq=billy+kersands+\%22old+aunt+jemima\%22\&hl=en\&sa=X\&ei=8AiLVczlLci2-AGChYHYBA\&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA\#v=onepage\&q=billy\%20kersands\%20\%22old\%20aunt\%20jemima\%22\&f=false}{Old
Aunt Jemima}''; and the logo's eventual purchase and establishment as a
trademark by the Quaker Oats Company
\href{//www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2821.html}{in 1925},
where it remains one of the longest continually running logos and
trademarks in the history of American advertising.

This Aunt Jemima logo was an outgrowth of Old South plantation nostalgia
and romance grounded in an idea about the "mammy," a devoted and
submissive servant who eagerly nurtured the children of her white master
and mistress while neglecting her own. Visually, the plantation myth
portrayed her as an asexual, plump black woman wearing a headscarf.

Few moments have underscored the continuing influence of the plantation
myth, and its impact on Confederate scripts of slavery, more profoundly
than the
\href{//www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/the-mammy-washington-almost-had/276431/}{nearly
successful effort} of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to erect a
monument in honor of the "faithful slave mammies of the South" in the
nation's capital in 1923.

It is about time for there to be some honest conversation about what is
at stake in continuing to market products even nowadays under names such
as ``Aunt Jemima.''
