Slide 1 of 9,

The influence of the early fashion and commercial photographer Paul
Outerbridge on the artists of his time, and for generations afterward,
is difficult to overstate: Marcel Duchamp even kept one of his photos in
his studio. His careful composition and witty eye --- and, crucially for
the era, his experiments with color --- lend a striking modernity to
photos eight or more decades old, like this one: ``Girl in Bathing
Suit,'' c. 1936.

A show of Outerbridge's work opens tomorrow, and runs through Sept. 30,
at Bruce Silverstein Gallery,~535 West 24th Street, New York,
