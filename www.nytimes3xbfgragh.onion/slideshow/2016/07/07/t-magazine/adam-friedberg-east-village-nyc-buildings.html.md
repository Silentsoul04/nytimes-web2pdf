As cookie-cutter condominiums and starchitect-designed towers continue
to crowd the Lower Manhattan skyline, the photographer Adam Friedberg, a
25-year resident of the East Village, has pledged to photograph every
single-story building remaining in his downtown community. “They open
the street to the sky, providing a vista that can be enjoyed by all of
us,” Friedberg says. Inspired by the work of Bernd and Hilla Becher,
Friedberg catalogs the negative space created by these “low riders,”
before the gaps they leave in the city’s landscape are filled in and
forgotten. — JAMIE SIMS
