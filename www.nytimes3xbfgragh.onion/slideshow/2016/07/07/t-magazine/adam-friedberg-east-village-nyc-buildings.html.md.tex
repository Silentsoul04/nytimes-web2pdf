Slide 1 of 19,

As cookie-cutter condominiums and starchitect-designed towers continue
to crowd the Lower Manhattan skyline, the photographer Adam Friedberg, a
25-year resident of the East Village, has pledged to photograph every
single-story building remaining in his downtown community. ``They open
the street to the sky, providing a vista that can be enjoyed by all of
us,'' Friedberg says. Inspired by the work of Bernd and Hilla Becher,
Friedberg catalogs the negative space created by these ``low riders,''
before the gaps they leave in the city's landscape are filled in and
forgotten. --- JAMIE SIMS~
