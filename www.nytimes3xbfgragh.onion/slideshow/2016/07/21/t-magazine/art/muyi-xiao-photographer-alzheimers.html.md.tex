Slide 1 of 18,

When the photographer Muyi Xiao lost her grandmother, Aimei Li, who
suffered from Alzheimer's, she felt a sense of separation --- not just
because her grandmother was several thousand miles away in China, but
also because of the emotional distance that had grown between them as
she was suffering from the disease. In response, Xiao developed a
project, ``Forget Me Not,'' comprised of two parts, approached from two
different perspectives.~In the first part, Xiao documents~Suzy,~a woman
of no relation to the family, who is currently suffering from
Alzheimer's.~In the other, Xiao's mother, Hanju Jin,~contributed images
that reminded her of Li.~Delicate and solemn, the photos evoke the pain
that comes with losing someone who isn't quite ready to go.

Here, Xiao explains, ``Suzy takes a walk in the yard of a nursing home
where she lives, in Nassau County, New York.''
