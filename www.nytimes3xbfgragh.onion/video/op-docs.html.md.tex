  Katyusha. Yes, Katyusha! 00:00:28:08 00:00:30:08 Marmelade.
  00:00:30:19 00:00:34:07 Is your little friend in heat? 00:00:45:19
  00:00:48:18 Hello Irene! How are things? 00:00:49:14 00:00:51:04 All
  good, thank you. And you? 00:00:51:11 00:00:54:04 All okay! I′m coming
  up to the Swiss border. 00:00:54:12 00:00:59:02 And I′ll be at yours
  in 1 hour 50 minutes, if that′s okay. 00:01:00:06 00:01:01:16 Great,
  I′m expecting you. 00:01:01:23 00:01:04:01 Is Hector ready? Is he
  okay? 00:01:04:03 00:01:06:01 Hector is okay, yes. 00:01:06:17
  00:01:09:17 - Okay then! - See you soon! 00:01:10:08 00:01:12:03 Bye!
  00:01:33:03 00:01:36:19 Okay. Have fun, you two! 00:03:07:06
  00:03:11:03 We did it. Yes, we did it. 00:03:19:23 00:03:23:06 I love
  you, Marmelade. 00:03:27:15 00:03:31:00 You′re my whole heart.
  00:03:47:00 00:03:48:13 By the way... 00:03:48:21 00:03:52:04 The
  family in Vienna just wrote me: 00:03:56:15 00:04:00:24 The babies
  from two years ago, are about to turn two. 00:04:01:08 00:04:04:01
  They′re so cute. 00:04:07:09 00:04:10:05 They′re so very cute!
  00:04:11:24 00:04:14:13 Beautiful, just like you... 00:04:17:03
  00:04:18:07 Yes. 00:04:18:14 00:04:20:24 Katyusha is eating.
  00:04:22:14 00:04:24:13 Katyusha. 00:04:25:09 00:04:27:17 Katyusha.
  00:05:04:14 00:05:08:16 You're not going into heat again now?
  00:05:12:04 00:05:16:06 We'll have to visit the tomcat again, please
  spare me that. 00:05:16:15 00:05:18:24 It's always so far away.
  00:05:37:04 00:05:38:12 Alexa! 00:05:39:06 00:05:42:10 How many
  kittens can cats have? 00:05:44:03 00:05:46:12 I′m afraid I don′t
  know. 00:05:46:19 00:05:48:06 Alexa! 00:05:49:22 00:05:54:03 Alexa!
  Please learn everything about cats. 00:05:55:13 00:05:58:12 Cats
  belong to the predator family 00:05:58:19 00:06:01:09 and to the order
  of feline species. 00:06:01:16 00:06:07:01 They are divided into big
  cats, such as lions, tigers and leopards 00:06:07:08 00:06:12:06 and
  small cats, such as the wild cat, lynx and ocelot. 00:06:15:21
  00:06:18:23 Alexa, I love cats! 00:06:21:04 00:06:27:09 Just to
  confirm: You′d like to hear the song ``Cool For Cats``? 00:06:27:24
  00:06:28:24 No. 00:07:32:13 00:07:36:21 I can find you anywhere in the
  world now. 00:08:07:13 00:08:08:12 See... 00:08:08:19 00:08:11:05 So,
  that should be enough. 00:08:11:12 00:08:13:24 You can take the hairs
  with you. 00:08:15:10 00:08:18:14 I′ll give you a bag for them later,
  thank you. 00:08:19:00 00:08:20:21 There, that was the worst of it.
  00:08:21:03 00:08:24:05 They usually don′t like that at all. But she
  did so well. 00:08:25:10 00:08:28:02 I′ll apply the gel now. It′s a
  bit cold. 00:08:41:05 00:08:45:01 It′s lying here. You can see the
  spine and the tiny head. 00:08:50:18 00:08:54:14 I′ll give the
  expectant father a print out. 00:08:54:22 00:08:56:04 Or should I say
  grandfather? 00:08:58:14 00:09:01:17 Great. I′ll print it, as proof.
  00:09:02:16 00:09:05:11 You can put the prosecco on ice. 00:09:09:24
  00:09:14:06 Baby, you′re going to be a mummy... 00:09:19:10
  00:09:22:16 You're going to be a mum. 00:10:47:12 00:10:49:16 Guess
  what, dear Marmelade? 00:10:50:11 00:10:53:00 You′re going to have
  babies soon. 00:10:56:08 00:10:58:22 Are you listening to me?
  00:10:59:04 00:11:02:21 Marmelade, come on, look at me. 00:11:04:10
  00:11:06:21 Listen - don′t just eat! 00:11:07:03 00:11:09:11 Are you
  listening to me? 00:11:54:00 00:11:56:20 Where are you, my little
  ones? 00:11:59:12 00:12:01:16 Listen to me! 00:12:43:20 00:12:45:16
  It′s almost time now. 00:12:49:12 00:12:52:07 Are you going to give me
  beautiful babies? 00:12:53:15 00:12:55:15 Are you jealous? 00:12:56:00
  00:12:58:08 You can′t be jealous. 00:13:11:12 00:13:14:08 Katyusha,
  come here. 00:13:15:09 00:13:17:06 Come here. 00:13:47:05 00:13:50:18
  Yes. I′m here for you, baby. 00:13:51:13 00:13:54:07 Katyusha, behave
  well. 00:14:23:21 00:14:25:22 Yes, yes. 00:14:27:01 00:14:29:04 Push!
  Push! 00:14:30:03 00:14:31:17 Push! 00:14:31:24 00:14:33:23 Push baby,
  yes! 00:14:36:11 00:14:38:02 Push. 00:14:47:23 00:14:50:04 Yes, yes.
  00:14:51:00 00:14:52:18 Push! 00:15:01:10 00:15:03:05 Well done.
  00:15:05:17 00:15:06:13 Push. 00:15:06:21 00:15:08:15 Yes, yes, yes!
  00:15:08:23 00:15:11:00 The first one is here! 00:15:12:07 00:15:14:03
  Come, come, come! 00:15:16:19 00:15:19:12 Katyusha, the first baby is
  here! 00:15:28:03 00:15:29:13 Yes, it′s okay. 00:16:03:22 00:16:05:05
  Alexa, 00:16:06:00 00:16:09:18 play the Russian love song
  ``Katyusha``. 00:16:11:17 00:16:15:20 Here is ``Katyusha'' by The Red
  Army Choir on Amazon Music.
