## The Sound of Gravity

#### Albert Einstein had a theory. These scientists proved it a century later.

</div>

  -   
    Wherever you go, there are things in nature that you can see or
    things that you hear. \[MUSIC PLAYING\] Things that sort of grab you
    and put some question in your mind. For example, you see a rainbow.
    I mean, they’re this wonderful mysterious thing. But why? Why does
    this happen? And we find out it’s because of the way the different
    colors get separated inside of a water drop. Understanding what’s
    going on in nature, that makes you more at unity with what is around
    you. That’s what science is about. And sometimes, when you look at
    the world, you’re going to learn something brand new. Something
    nobody has ever seen before. And that’s what this whole story is
    about. \[MUSIC PLAYING\] So when I was a kid, I was sort of a lousy
    student. School was quite rigid and grades were a thing that some
    people made a big fuss over. I just couldn’t see it. But I got mixed
    up with electronics real early in my life. There was a section of
    New York City, which, for nickels and dimes, I could buy all sorts
    of wonderful electronic junk. You could make almost anything you
    wanted. And so I learned most of the things that I learned in my
    life by building something and then trying to make it work. So I
    came to M.I.T., and they took me, which is sort of miraculous. I
    don’t know why, but they took me. And I became a physicist, by
    default. Because it looked to me like physics was a place where you
    had a little more freedom. And that’s where, suddenly, I got my
    education into what became permanently part of my life. And it was
    the Einstein Theory of General Relativity. Now general relativity is
    tricky. But the way I can best explain it to you is that it was a
    completely different conceptualization of how gravity operates. So
    for Einstein, the way he thought about gravity was it actually
    distorted space and time. Took straight lines in space and made them
    curved lines. It’s a thing that actually changes the realm of
    nature. At the time, it was just unbelievable shock-worthy stuff.
    But it turns out he was absolutely right. You have to understand,
    Einstein had an intuition that was remarkable. He understood nature
    in a visceral way, almost like he had a direct pipeline to God, if
    you want to call it that. Then in 1916, he writes about something
    called gravitational waves. He recognizes that matter makes waves
    when it gets accelerated. And it travels at the velocity of light
    and stretches space in this dimension and compresses space in that
    dimension. And it goes through everything. It just — nothing stops
    the gravitational waves. But then, he comes to the conclusion right
    at the end of that paper and says, look, this new thing I just
    invented, this is never going to amount to anything you can measure.
    It’s just too tiny. It’s hopeless. But the fact is that, in this
    case, Einstein was completely wrong. And that is really that whole
    story of LIGO. \[TAPE REWINDING\] Anyway, so let’s get back to
    M.I.T. Eventually, I became a faculty member. And I was asked to
    teach a general relativity course to graduate students. And as the
    course wore on, the students asked me how you would make a device
    that can measure gravitational waves. So I remember, on Sunday
    night, and the lecture was on Tuesday, it suddenly dawned on me,
    maybe the right way to explain this is really simple. You put a mass
    over here, and you put another mass over there. Put a mirror on
    this. And then you take a light source and measure the time it takes
    the light to go from here to there and back again. And now what
    happens is that a gravitational wave comes down on this thing and
    change the space in between those two masses. And that would change
    the time it took the light to go back and forth. Very simple
    calculation. I said that, “Eh\! That’s the way to do a gravitational
    wave detection. Now you understand.” So I said, “OK, I’d like to
    build a prototype.” So one of us has to stand on the table and — And
    it eventually became clear to me I had to have three masses so you
    could measure both the stretching of space as well as the shrinking
    of space. And then you could compare those two. I clearly had to use
    lasers. And then we had to measure the tiny little motions that are
    associated with the gravitational wave. It’s about one-thousandth
    the size of a nucleus of an atom. Such a small fraction that nobody
    can conceive of something so small. And measure it — that’s crazy\!
    But anyway, we built a prototype. And we started operating it. So
    the laser is here. The light comes out and goes streaming through a
    whole bunch of stuff. And the first thing, this is Rai’s phase
    modulating crystals. But at the same time, there was no support for
    this crazy research. Because I wasn’t saying we are going to see
    gravitational waves with it. I couldn’t. I would have lied if I said
    we have the technology now. We had another factor of a million to
    go. People threw us out the door when we told them that. But the
    National Science Foundation started funding me at a reasonable level
    so I could start building bigger detectors and a bigger team. I
    first met Rai Weiss as a first-year graduate student at M.I.T. And
    when I talked to him about gravitational waves, I actually thought
    he was really just crazy, because it was such an impossible
    measurement to make. But if it worked, it was really going to open
    up a completely new window into the universe. So I mean who can
    resist that? \[MUSIC PLAYING\] So when I joined, I was part of the
    team that built the LIGO Gravitational Wave Observatory that was
    proposed by Rai Weiss in the early 1970s. He proposed that you have
    to use very long detectors. So we built these four-kilometer-long
    facilities in Washington and Louisiana that were large enough that
    it became kind of possible to think about detecting gravitational
    waves from them. But at the same time, there were no guarantees that
    we’d see anything. We knew we were charting unknown territory. So
    LIGO is a gravitational wave telescope. And because of Einstein’s
    theory, we knew that out in the universe we have black holes. And
    black holes, in some sense, are the most gravitational object you
    could imagine. They have so much mass in a small volume that even
    light can’t escape their gravitational pull. But by the ‘70s and
    ‘80s, we had the theory that black holes can exist in pairs,
    orbiting each other. And they get closer and closer, and they orbit
    faster and faster until eventually they collide. And in that
    process, they radiate these ripples of spacetime that travel to us.
    And we here on the Earth get rocked, ever so slightly, by the
    passing gravitational wave. And then, in the detector, those mirrors
    will move closer together or farther apart. And so our computer
    would see the signal, which is just a series of peaks and troughs
    that were growing in size and getting closer in time. So that’s what
    we were trying to see. But let me just tell you, no one had ever
    seen two black holes collide. And it was seen as something that was
    a pretty long shot. So yeah, I had moments where I would really
    question, you know, will we see these gravitational waves in my
    lifetime? Because even if it occurs in nature, we weren’t sure if
    the instrument would be sensitive enough. But here we were in
    September 2015, construction was coming close to completion, and we
    had to at some point say, “OK, the improvements are going to wait,
    we’re going to turn on the instrument.” And then, overnight, the
    instrument registered something interesting. Whoa, what’s that?
    What’s happened? I go to the computer, and I look at the screen.
    And lo and behold, there is this incredible picture of the wave
    form. And it looked like exactly the thing that had been imagined by
    Einstein. Now I have to admit to you that I was still skeptical for
    a long, long time. Because especially with so many reputations and
    all that beautiful work that had now gone into this thing, we did
    not want to come and make a false detection. But eventually, it came
    down to the point where we began to believe it. Ladies and
    gentlemen, we have detected gravitational waves. We did it.
    Scientists have announced what may be among the greatest discoveries
    in the history of physics. Gravity waves predicted by Einstein, but
    never observed. My first thought was, too bad Einstein isn’t alive
    anymore, I’d love to tell him about it. And what would he have said?
    My guess is that Einstein would have been tickled pink but also very
    skeptical and want to know exactly how the technology worked. That’s
    my guess. And then, it only slowly dawned on us that we had made new
    science. Science which is really at the basic core of the
    fundamentals of what makes nature operate. The Royal Swedish Academy
    of Sciences has decided to award the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics to
    Rainer Weiss for the observation of gravitational waves. Rai Weiss
    knew how to measure gravitational waves in 1972. And he’s been going
    at it ever since. And so thanks to this work, suddenly, we have
    developed an entirely new sense for observing the universe. We are
    hearing gravity for the first time. And in some sense, we may be
    able to sort of hear the assembly of the first galaxies to try to
    understand how our universe came to be and was assembled. It’s
    pretty amazing. I think the science of physics — the natural
    philosophy of the universe — belongs to everybody. Belongs to you,
    belongs to me, belongs to everybody. But, I mean, I am 87. And so
    this new science is something which is a challenge to the young
    people. That’s the future. So now let me ask you a question. With
    gravitational waves, you have a new way to look at the universe. You
    can see all of what nature has in store. So now comes the question:
    What do you want to find out? It’s going to be spectacular, I
think.
