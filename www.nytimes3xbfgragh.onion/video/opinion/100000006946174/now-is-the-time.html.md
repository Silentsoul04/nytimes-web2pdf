## Now Is the Time

#### In the next film from our Sundance 2020 series, two brothers carve their community’s first totem pole in nearly a century.

</div>

  -   
    \[MUSIC PLAYING\] I was so naïve on the idea. It was all new. I
    asked Nonnie, were there any totem poles raised in the village in
    her lifetime, and she said no, and she was born in 1895. \[SAWING\]
    Today, there are few carvers. This boy may be one of the last. I saw
    the old totem poles at the museums, and I saw them in photographs,
    and I’d come home and there was nothing. This village here, right
    from the way down this end of the town right through here, totem
    pole. Lot of it, in my time, and up in the other village, the same
    way. Ministry says, if they don’t get rid of these totem poles, you
    never go to heaven. That’s what the minister told the Indians. So
    they want all Indians get together, cut all the totem poles down,
    and burn them up. Cut them all down, cut them in, oh, about, oh,
    four-foot lengths, something you can lift. And cut them all up, and
    split them, and make big fire and burn them. I used to help too. I
    wanted to go to heaven. Our children heard the song before they were
    born, Haida singing. I didn’t hear any Haida songs until I was 16. I
    would go and visit the elders, and they seemed really kind of not
    connecting to anything. And I could feel the sadness, and I wanted
    to create an occasion for them to celebrate one more time. That was
    the moment I committed to carving the totem pole. After I made the
    commitment to carve the pole, I had no idea in what was involved,
    and I remember getting a phone call from my dad. He said, “I found a
    log for you.” I said, “Oh, yeah, right. I need the log.” And I
    remember not even wanting to look at the log. I was so terrified.
    And I said, “Holy shit” when I saw the log. I didn’t know how to
    work on that scale. I was only carving argillite totem poles then.
    Think of how bland it would be if we didn’t know how to dance, we
    didn’t know how to sing, we didn’t know how to carve poles. We need
    those kinds of things in our life, and they’re gifts to everybody.
    On one of my trips back home, I knocked on every door in the village
    in Masset to see if there was anything left from the classical
    period, see if anybody had anything. And that’s when I found one
    storage box. When I saw it, I was just blown away by it, and I took
    it home, and I — I put it beside my bed and slept with it. I was so
    taken by it, by having this one object that survived this whole dark
    period. There was really a void, but I didn’t realize the scale of
    that void. When I learned to carve, I just learned from Robert. He
    made it easier. He visited all the elders. They taught him the songs
    and dances. He taught us. He offered me $15 a day. \[LAUGHING\] I
    mean, I was 14 years old. That’s a lot of money, right? Working on
    the pole was a pretty amazing experience for me, just ’cause it’s
    all new to me. It’s grasping to learn of our culture. These are
    Raven rattles. I had a dream about Raven rattles. We use them in our
    Raven dance, and they just move. \[CLACKING\] Spirit of Gossip.
    Gaagiit is a supernatural being. Tsinii talked about Gaagiit as a
    person whose spirit is too strong to die. I like to equate our
    spirit as being too strong to die, and that’s — that’s why we’re
    still here. There was a couple of people that were saying, “Why do
    you want to bring those old things back?” That really just came from
    pain. The pain that they went through. I mean, I cried when I heard
    that. But it didn’t stop us. And those same people were there
    celebrating with us. Ho\! Heave\! The village is made up of two
    clans, Eagle and Raven. To do this traditionally, either an Eagle
    clan has the pole raising, or Raven clan. I wanted the whole village
    to get involved, and the only way to have that is to have both clans
    working together. Old Masset, it’s just like a beehive. Everybody
    from the different clans has their work to do, like the old days. I
    remember being one of the pullers on the rope, and Tsinii was there
    guiding us. He said, “Robert, that totem pole doesn’t belong to you
    anymore. It belongs to them.” So I — I stepped back. There was a
    construction crew there, and they had a crane, and they offered to
    raise the pole with their crane. And I mentioned it in one of the
    meetings, and they said, “No, we’re going to do it the old way.” I
    didn’t realize how much ceremony was connected to the art until that
    moment. My grandparents and their generation coming together, and
    they all told stories, and from those stories, that became the
    recipe for the pole raising. \[INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT\] Uncle
    Victor said, “Robert, Tsinii wants to talk with you.” So Tsinii
    said, “You have to get the tools now and start the ceremony.”
    \[CHANTING\] When I was chanting, I was in a different realm. And it
    also marked the completion of the pole. \[INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT\]
    \[CHATTER\] Ho\! Heave\! I felt really good. I just thought, you
    know, every time they raise the pole, say about another six inches
    to a foot, and then they braced it, I thought it was just going to
    come back down and just fall. Ho\! Heave\! Pull, Eagles\! Pull\!
    Heave\! Ho\! Heave\! Ho\! Heave\! \[DRUMMING AND APPLAUSE\]
    \[DRUMMING\] I think it was a good thing. I think it’s one of the
    highlights in my life. And yet the sorrow in knowing that, possibly,
    it’s gone for good. We’re trying to pick up something and hold on to
    it, but there’s maybe not enough to hold on to. You know, it was
    ground zero. Couldn’t have been timed any better. Some of the old
    people showed up — \[CRYING\] There was Tsinii. He had a toy drum.
    And some of the old people showed up with paper headpieces. When I
    talk about ground zero, it couldn’t go any lower because of the laws
    that governed us, the beauty, and our will to participate in
    ceremony, participate in our song and dance, the very thing that
    fills the spirit. \[MUSIC PLAYING\] Three generations, and they
    could work together and make it happen. We’re so lucky that they
    were there. \[SINGING AND DRUMMING\] The pole was important because
    it was a deliberate action. It was deliberate bringing back of those
    — that part of our life. The carvers at home sitting and carving the
    argillite — it was watching my great-grandmother put old blankets on
    the windows so that people couldn’t see in, and they’d sing the old
    songs and play the drum. All of that, not just the pole. I didn’t
    think of it as a start of something. I just saw it as a celebration
    for the old people. \[APPLAUSE\] You know, I was just a young smart
    aleck kid thinking I was going to teach elders something.
    \[LAUGHING\] But it turned around. It was the other way around.
    \[SINGING AND DRUMMING\] \[MUSIC
PLAYING\]
