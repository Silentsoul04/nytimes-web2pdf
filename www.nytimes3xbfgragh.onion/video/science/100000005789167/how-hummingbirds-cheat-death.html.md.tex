  Hummingbirds are pure delight, shimmering colors, wings beating up to
  80 times a second. But there's a furnace beneath those feathers. This
  is infrared, a glimpse of a hummingbird's internal heat. Metabolism at
  full burn. When a hummingbird is hovering with its heart beating more
  than 1,000 times a minute, it burns more energy, ounce for ounce, than
  any other bird or mammal. But wait, here's that same bird at night
  with its metabolism slowed to a crawl. It's in a state called torpor.
  Heartbeat and temperature have dropped so low that the bird is using
  1/50th of the energy it would use if it were zooming around during the
  day. Good thing, otherwise in eight hours without feeding, it could
  starve to death. No wonder scientists have long studied these birds.
  Ken Welch, for one, has spent more than a decade figuring out how
  these birds manage their energy budgets. ``I learned to become a bit
  of the hummingbird whisperer. And eventually I figured out how to
  think like a hummingbird and how to get them to cooperate.'' Here's
  how their metabolism works. Hummingbirds are much better than most
  animals at switching between fat and sugar to power their muscles. And
  since they feed on nectar that is half glucose and half fructose,
  they've evolved a way to send that fructose directly to their muscles
  to use. Humans mainly fuel their bodies through glucose. For us
  fructose, as in high fructose corn syrup, goes straight to fat. And
  even glucose doesn't move to human muscles as quickly. But
  hummingbirds can essentially mainline nectar. In 15 minutes, their
  flight muscles are burning sugars that they have just swallowed. In
  order to study these birds, Welch has to train them to hover and drink
  with their head in a mask that measures oxygen use. The mask is a lot
  like those used on humans with a slight difference in results. ``Their
  metabolic rate when they're hovering is, pound for pound, 10 times
  what an elite human athlete can achieve.'' What Welch and his
  colleagues have studied recently is how size relates to energy
  efficiency. Some hummingbirds weigh less than a penny. Some way 10
  times more, almost a full ounce. As you can see little birds have to
  beat their wings a lot faster to hover. And what Welch discovered is
  that the faster the wing beats, the less efficient the energy use.
  What does it all mean? Hummingbirds are pure delight, both to the eye
  and to science.
