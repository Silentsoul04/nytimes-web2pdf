## Ahmaud Arbery’s Final Minutes: What Videos and 911 Calls Show

#### Using security footage, cellphone video, 911 calls and police reports, The Times has reconstructed the 12 minutes before Ahmaud Arbery was shot dead in Georgia on Feb. 23.

</div>

  -   
    In February, 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery was shot dead in the south
    Georgia neighborhood of Satilla Shores. In the two months that
    followed, no arrests were made. But local residents and lawmakers
    protested what they said was a deadly combination of racial
    profiling and flawed self-defense laws. “When they stop you, make
    sure you got your cameras on. Make sure you got a video.” Police did
    eventually arrest 2 suspects, but it was days after this video of
    the fatal shooting emerged. Gregory McMichael and his son Travis
    were charged with murder and aggravated assault. The case has
    reignited the national debate over racial violence. “I’m sure you
    saw the news about Ahmaud Arbery.” “It looks like murder.” “The
    American public saw the video.” What exactly happened in the last
    moments of Mr. Arbery’s life? Using security camera footage,
    cellphone video, and 911 calls and logs, The Times has reconstructed
    the critical 12 minutes from when Mr. Arbery appeared on Satilla
    Drive to his death, less than 300 yards away. It’s around 1 p.m. on
    Feb. 23 when Ahmaud Arbery is out, less than 2 miles from his home.
    A security camera at 219 Satilla Drive is recording when Mr. Arbery
    enters the frame at around 1:04 p.m. He may have been jogging in the
    area, but he stops on the front lawn of 220 Satilla, a house being
    built across the street. Arbery glances around and wanders into the
    open construction site. Inside, security footage briefly captures
    him looking around. Meanwhile outside, a neighbor walks from Jones
    Road towards Satilla Drive and calls 911. The neighbor waits by the
    street corner. He will later tell the dispatcher that Arbery
    resembles a recent trespasser in the area. On multiple occasions
    before Feb. 23, several trespassers were caught on camera at 220
    Satilla. The owner routinely alerted the police. On four occasions,
    what appears to be the same man was filmed. It’s unclear if this was
    Arbery, but even if it were, this does not justify his shooting by
    neighbors outside on the street. The site’s owner says nothing was
    ever stolen from the house during these incidents or on Feb. 23, and
    no property was ever damaged. But neighbors were aware of the
    trespasses and the community was on alert. Now, back to the day in
    question. It’s 1:08 p.m. and Arbery is walking around inside the
    house. Four minutes after he entered, he walks out and runs off. In
    the top corner of the security footage, we can see down the street
    to 230 Satilla, the home of Travis McMichael. At 1:10 p.m., Travis
    and his father, Gregory, grab their guns, jump in a white truck, and
    leave the house to pursue Mr. Arbery. We don’t have footage showing
    the next 3 minutes, but testimony Gregory McMichael gave police at
    the scene, and interviews by another witness, Roddy Bryan, indicate
    what happened. Gregory and Travis McMichael follow Arbery onto
    Burford Road. Their neighbor Roddy Bryan sees the pursuit, gets in
    his car and follows. The McMichaels try to cut Arbery off. Arbery
    doubles back and passes them. Bryan tries to block Arbery, but
    Arbery runs past him and toward Holmes Road. Gregory McMichael
    climbs from the cab to the bed of the truck armed with a handgun. We
    don’t know exactly what happens next. But Bryan and the McMichaels
    end up following Arbery on Holmes Road. And we next see Arbery at
    1:14 p.m. running back down Holmes Road away from Roddy Bryan and
    toward the McMichaels. Roddy Bryan is filming and — a warning —
    these scenes are distressing. Gregory McMichael dials 911 at this
    time. Let’s watch this back and break down what happens. This is
    Arbery. He has been running from the vehicles for almost 4 minutes.
    Travis is standing by the driver’s side of the truck, armed with a
    shotgun. Gregory is in the bed of the truck on the 911 call. Arbery
    doesn’t know where to run. He veers right, then left and then darts
    around the right side of the vehicle. Arbery comes around the front
    of the truck. We see his white T-shirt through the windshield and
    here is Travis now leaning toward him. This is the instant the first
    shot is fired. Arbery is hit in the chest, his right lung, ribs, and
    sternum are injured. The two men wrestle over the gun. Gregory
    shouts: “Travis\!” Arbery punches Travis. In the back of the truck,
    Gregory drops the cellphone. A second blast goes off out of frame.
    But we see the shotgun smoke here. Arbery is heavily bleeding. He
    throws another punch. Travis fires a final shot, which hits Arbery
    in his left upper chest. Travis walks away holding his gun. Gregory
    gets off the truck clutching his .357 Magnum. According to the
    police report, Gregory rolled Arbery over to see if he had a weapon.
    He did not. Police officers arrive within seconds of the shooting,
    and a minute or so later at 1:16 p.m., Police Officer R. Minshew
    reports: Two subjects on Holmes Road. Shots fired. Male on ground
    bleeding out. The police took Gregory McMichael’s testimony and let
    the two men go. But now the McMichaels both face serious charges.
    Hi, this is Malachy and I reported this story. For transparency, a
    note about the security footage used in this video, which was first
    published by The Atlanta Journal Constitution. The time code you see
    here is incorrect. We know this because we lined up what we see in
    this video with what we hear in two 911 calls and we confirmed the
    time of those calls. These details and police logs also allowed us
    to determine that Gregory McMichael called 911 from his son’s phone
    just before the fatal shooting. So in this video, we used the real
    time that events happened. Thank you for
watching.
