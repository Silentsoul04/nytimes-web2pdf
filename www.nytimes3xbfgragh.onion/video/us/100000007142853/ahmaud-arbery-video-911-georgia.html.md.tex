\begin{itemize}

\item
  In February, 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery was shot dead in the south
  Georgia neighborhood of Satilla Shores. In the two months that
  followed, no arrests were made. But local residents and lawmakers
  protested what they said was a deadly combination of racial profiling
  and flawed self-defense laws. ``When they stop you, make sure you got
  your cameras on. Make sure you got a video.'' Police did eventually
  arrest 2 suspects, but it was days after this video of the fatal
  shooting emerged. Gregory McMichael and his son Travis were charged
  with murder and aggravated assault. The case has reignited the
  national debate over racial violence. ``I'm sure you saw the news
  about Ahmaud Arbery.'' ``It looks like murder.'' ``The American public
  saw the video.'' What exactly happened in the last moments of Mr.
  Arbery's life? Using security camera footage, cellphone video, and 911
  calls and logs, The Times has reconstructed the critical 12 minutes
  from when Mr. Arbery appeared on Satilla Drive to his death, less than
  300 yards away. It's around 1 p.m. on Feb. 23 when Ahmaud Arbery is
  out, less than 2 miles from his home. A security camera at 219 Satilla
  Drive is recording when Mr. Arbery enters the frame at around 1:04
  p.m. He may have been jogging in the area, but he stops on the front
  lawn of 220 Satilla, a house being built across the street. Arbery
  glances around and wanders into the open construction site. Inside,
  security footage briefly captures him looking around. Meanwhile
  outside, a neighbor walks from Jones Road towards Satilla Drive and
  calls 911. The neighbor waits by the street corner. He will later tell
  the dispatcher that Arbery resembles a recent trespasser in the area.
  On multiple occasions before Feb. 23, several trespassers were caught
  on camera at 220 Satilla. The owner routinely alerted the police. On
  four occasions, what appears to be the same man was filmed. It's
  unclear if this was Arbery, but even if it were, this does not justify
  his shooting by neighbors outside on the street. The site's owner says
  nothing was ever stolen from the house during these incidents or on
  Feb. 23, and no property was ever damaged. But neighbors were aware of
  the trespasses and the community was on alert. Now, back to the day in
  question. It's 1:08 p.m. and Arbery is walking around inside the
  house. Four minutes after he entered, he walks out and runs off. In
  the top corner of the security footage, we can see down the street to
  230 Satilla, the home of Travis McMichael. At 1:10 p.m., Travis and
  his father, Gregory, grab their guns, jump in a white truck, and leave
  the house to pursue Mr. Arbery. We don't have footage showing the next
  3 minutes, but testimony Gregory McMichael gave police at the scene,
  and interviews by another witness, Roddy Bryan, indicate what
  happened. Gregory and Travis McMichael follow Arbery onto Burford
  Road. Their neighbor Roddy Bryan sees the pursuit, gets in his car and
  follows. The McMichaels try to cut Arbery off. Arbery doubles back and
  passes them. Bryan tries to block Arbery, but Arbery runs past him and
  toward Holmes Road. Gregory McMichael climbs from the cab to the bed
  of the truck armed with a handgun. We don't know exactly what happens
  next. But Bryan and the McMichaels end up following Arbery on Holmes
  Road. And we next see Arbery at 1:14 p.m. running back down Holmes
  Road away from Roddy Bryan and toward the McMichaels. Roddy Bryan is
  filming and --- a warning --- these scenes are distressing. Gregory
  McMichael dials 911 at this time. Let's watch this back and break down
  what happens. This is Arbery. He has been running from the vehicles
  for almost 4 minutes. Travis is standing by the driver's side of the
  truck, armed with a shotgun. Gregory is in the bed of the truck on the
  911 call. Arbery doesn't know where to run. He veers right, then left
  and then darts around the right side of the vehicle. Arbery comes
  around the front of the truck. We see his white T-shirt through the
  windshield and here is Travis now leaning toward him. This is the
  instant the first shot is fired. Arbery is hit in the chest, his right
  lung, ribs, and sternum are injured. The two men wrestle over the gun.
  Gregory shouts: ``Travis!'' Arbery punches Travis. In the back of the
  truck, Gregory drops the cellphone. A second blast goes off out of
  frame. But we see the shotgun smoke here. Arbery is heavily bleeding.
  He throws another punch. Travis fires a final shot, which hits Arbery
  in his left upper chest. Travis walks away holding his gun. Gregory
  gets off the truck clutching his .357 Magnum. According to the police
  report, Gregory rolled Arbery over to see if he had a weapon. He did
  not. Police officers arrive within seconds of the shooting, and a
  minute or so later at 1:16 p.m., Police Officer R. Minshew reports:
  Two subjects on Holmes Road. Shots fired. Male on ground bleeding out.
  The police took Gregory McMichael's testimony and let the two men go.
  But now the McMichaels both face serious charges. Hi, this is Malachy
  and I reported this story. For transparency, a note about the security
  footage used in this video, which was first published by The Atlanta
  Journal Constitution. The time code you see here is incorrect. We know
  this because we lined up what we see in this video with what we hear
  in two 911 calls and we confirmed the time of those calls. These
  details and police logs also allowed us to determine that Gregory
  McMichael called 911 from his son's phone just before the fatal
  shooting. So in this video, we used the real time that events
  happened. Thank you for watching.
