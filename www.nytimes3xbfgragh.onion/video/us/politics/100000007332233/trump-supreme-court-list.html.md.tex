  Should there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my
  presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the
  American public, including the original list and these 20 additions.
  Joe Biden has refused to release his list, perhaps because he knows
  the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand
  public scrutiny or receive acceptance. He must release a list of
  justices for people to properly make a decision as to how they will
  vote. It is very important that he do so. My original list of
  potential justices include many of our nation's brightest legal minds,
  such as Bill Pryor, Amy Coney Barrett and Thomas Hardiman. Their names
  are as follows: Bridget Bade of Arizona, judge on the Ninth Circuit
  Court of Appeals; Daniel Cameron of Kentucky, attorney general of the
  Commonwealth of Kentucky; Paul Clement of Virginia, former solicitor
  general of the United States; Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas; Senator
  Ted Cruz of Texas; Stuart Kyle Duncan of Louisiana, judge on the Fifth
  Circuit Court of Appeals; Steven Engel of the District of Columbia,
  assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel at the
  Department of Justice; Noel Francisco, former solicitor general of the
  United States; Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri; James Ho of Texas,
  judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals; Gregory Katsas of
  Virginia, judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals;
  Barbara Lagoa of Florida, judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court of
  Appeals; Christopher Landau of Maryland, United States ambassador to
  Mexico; Carlos Muniz of Florida, justice on the Supreme Court of
  Florida; Martha Pacold of Illinois, judge on the District Court for
  the Northern District of Illinois; Peter Phipps of Pennsylvania, judge
  on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; Sarah Pitlyk of Missouri, judge
  on the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri; Allison
  Jones Rushing of North Carolina, judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of
  Appeals; Kate Todd of Virginia, deputy assistant to the president and
  deputy counsel to the president; Lawrence VanDyke of Nevada, judge on
  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Every one of these individuals
  will ensure equal justice, equal treatment and equal rights for
  citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. Together we will
  defend our righteous heritage, and preserve our magnificent American
  way of life. Thank you. God bless America --- thank you very much.
