  You know, we just sat through a very emotional hearing where people
  tried to kill George Floyd a second time. They made all kind of
  foolish allegations, talking about he died from a drug overdose.
  {[}crowd jeering{]} They're trying to claim the knee on his neck for 8
  minutes and 46 seconds had nothing to do with his death. They are
  trying to say that the knee on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds
  was reasonable. They're trying to claim some asinine theory about a
  overdose. I want to be clear about this. The only overdose that killed
  George Floyd was an overdose of excessive force and racism by the
  Minnesota --- Minneapolis Police Department.
