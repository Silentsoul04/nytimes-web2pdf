  Kim Jong-un is becoming a more prominent figure on the world stage. He
  now frequently leaves North Korea and welcomes top officials in
  Pyongyang. And when looking at the dictator's high-profile public
  appearances, it would be difficult not to notice that they all share
  something in common: Mercedes. Mercedes. Rolls-Royce and more
  Mercedes. But how did Kim manage to get these luxury, bulletproof
  vehicles --- in open violation of an international ban on luxury goods
  --- to North North Korea? To answer this question, we teamed up with
  the non-profit research group Center for Advanced Defense Studies,
  which published a detailed report on sanctions evasions. Using
  shipping and corporate data, satellite images and interviews, we
  investigated a shipment of two bulletproof Mercedes. These vehicles
  cost at least \$500,000 and are primarily marketed to world leaders.
  We followed them through a circuitous network of ports, apparently
  designed to cloak their movement, and onto a ghost ship owned by a
  Russian businessman whose company has been accused of evading
  sanctions. Our story offers a glimpse into how North Korea skirts
  sanctions and how it likely uses similar techniques to procure far
  more dangerous goods. So first, let's take a look at the actual route.
  And the trail starts: in a shipping terminal in Rotterdam in June
  2018. The first part of the journey looks like a regular shipment.
  Nothing out of the ordinary. The cars are on two of the containers on
  this ship. From here, they're transported on a major international
  shipping line. After a 41 day journey, the cars arrive in China. We
  track them to the port of Dalian. From here, the cars are shipped to
  Japan, and from there they are sent in yet another ship to another
  port in Busan, South Korea. And here, the Russian-owned ship at the
  center of our investigation enters the picture. It picks up the
  containers and when it leaves the port, mysteriously vanishes, turning
  off its required transponder. Eighteen days later, the ship reappears,
  but now the cars are gone. And instead, it's carrying coal. So, what
  just happened? Let's take a closer look at this ghost ship. Its
  convoluted background offers clues as to why it was not at all a
  regular transport. It used to be called Xiang Jin and had links to
  North Korea. But shortly before it gets the cars, its name changes to
  DN5505 and its ownership is transferred to Do Young Shipping, a shell
  company in the Marshall Islands. It's Do Young Shipping that's owned
  by the Russian national. But you'd never know it because it sails
  under the flag of the West African nation Togo. And its safety manager
  is based in Hong Kong. Confused? That's the idea. Using that many
  jurisdictions is a classic sanctions evasion strategy. Our reporting
  also shows that this ship was trailing the cargo as soon as it entered
  China. Do you see it? It's right here. Satellite images we found
  suggest that it tried to pick up the cars at other ports in Asia. But
  the handoff happens weeks later in South Korea. So where did the
  containers go? Vladivostok, Russia. And here is why we think that:
  First, the ship's last reported destination before the transponder was
  turned off was a coal port next to Vladivostok. We think the cars were
  offloaded in this area. Second, the owner of the Russian ghost ship is
  based in Vladivostok. His name is Danil Kazachuk. And he confirmed
  that he bought and sold the Mercedes in a phone call to a Times
  reporter, but offered no further details. Four months after the cars
  disappeared, South Korean officials seized two of Kazachuk's ships,
  including the ghost ship, for alleged illicit trade of coal and oil
  with North Korea. Third, we tracked these North Korean transport
  planes, which made a rare visit to Vladivostok on Oct. 7 --- perfectly
  timed with the arrival of the containers. They are the very planes
  that normally carry Kim's luxury vehicles and a possible direct
  transportation link to North Korea. Our final clue: In January 2019,
  the same exact model of armored Mercedes was spotted on the streets of
  Pyongyang by the website North Korea News. {[}cheering{]} The route to
  Asia. The ghost ship in Busan. The North Korean planes. It's not
  possible to say if every part of this journey was illicit. But since
  2016, sanctions experts say that North Korea has used similar
  techniques to bring in vital fuel sources and technology for its
  weapons program. Which raises the question: How effective are
  sanctions as a tool to pressure Kim Jong-un to end his nuclear
  ambitions?
