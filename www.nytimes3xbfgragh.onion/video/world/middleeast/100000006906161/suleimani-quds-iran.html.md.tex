  Before he was killed in a U.S. drone strike, Iranian general Qassim
  Suleimani was showing up everywhere --- in Aleppo, Baghdad, Beirut,
  with Iran's leader, with Iraq's former prime minister. It wasn't
  always this way. For years, Suleimani was an under-the-radar operator
  in the Middle East. He ran an elite military unit called the Quds
  Force. It's an arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps that works to
  expand Iran's influence in the Middle East using covert military and
  intelligence tactics. But in 2014, things started to change. The
  elusive commander was spotted in the public eye more often. We started
  seeing him with militias, on battlefields, at funerals. He even had
  his own Instagram. We combed through hundreds of images and videos,
  many of them propaganda from Suleimani's early military days to his
  recent stint as a social media sensation. These appearances help paint
  a more complete picture of how the Quds Force operates, through a
  network of proxy forces, or local militias, along a key corridor that
  Iran calls the ``axis of resistance.'' It stretches through Iraq and
  Syria to Lebanon. Let's start in Lebanon. These are rare images that
  appear to have been taken very recently. They show Suleimani with
  Hassan Nasrallah, who is the leader of Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based
  militant group. Hezbollah is the archetype for how the Quds Force
  operates. They helped found the group and fund it to this day. This
  support fueled Hezbollah's rise as a political party, and as a
  military threat to Israel, Iran's archenemy. These are Hezbollah
  fighters posing with Iranian weapons. and here's a video of Suleimani
  with a senior commander of Hezbollah. The group gives Iran a key
  foothold in the region, along this corridor we told you about. This
  photo from 2013 reveals just how strong the bond is between these two
  groups. It shows a prominent Hezbollah member at a funeral for
  Suleimani's mother in Tehran. Two years later, that Hezbollah member
  died, and Suleimani himself made the trip to Beirut to pay his
  respects. He's seen here praying at his grave. Now let's look at how
  Suleimani took the Hezbollah playbook and mimicked it in Iraq. Here,
  too, sightings of Suleimani help tell the story. Here he is in 2015
  with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of an Iraq-based militia called
  Kataib Hezbollah, also known as K.H. Over the last few years, the two
  were seen frequently together, and the bond is strong here, too,
  judging by this propaganda video. Similar to Hezbollah, K.H. is active
  in politics and helped push Iran's interests in Baghdad. And it runs
  military operations. Suleimani's team trains and arms them, and one of
  their main targets over the years has been American forces. We found
  propaganda footage of K.H. attacks on American bases in Iraq. And K.H.
  also joined the fight against ISIS, which Iran considered a major
  threat. In fact, Suleimani even shows up at victories against ISIS in
  Iraq. These were brutal campaigns, where civilians were often
  collateral damage. K.H. would later be seen during the recent attack
  on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. That episode led up to Suleimani's
  killing, and the other senior commander to die in the attack was none
  other than K.H.'s leader: Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The next place we see
  Suleimani is Syria, the missing piece in Iran's strategic corridor.
  The militias we just told you about, Hezbollah and K.H., here they are
  in Syria, fighting to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stay in
  power. Syria was also the only place we actually saw Iranian
  operatives besides Suleimani in action. Here, one of them describes
  how they train fighters in Syria. But this video wasn't meant to be
  released. The footage was captured and leaked by Syrian opposition
  forces. Remember, it's all part of the playbook. Iranian Quds Force
  fighters rarely appeared in any of the videos we found. They stay
  under the radar and do most of their work through proxies. But we
  still see Suleimani. Here he is near Aleppo in 2015. The eventual fall
  of Aleppo became a key turning point for Assad, with devastating
  consequences for civilians. One big winner in all this bloodshed was
  Iran, which kept its foothold in Syria. There's another place on the
  map, Yemen, where Iran is active, but we don't see Suleimani here.
  Why? Because Iran doesn't want to be linked directly to the conflict.
  We do see other clues. These are Iranian weapons being used by a group
  called the Houthis. They're fighting against forces backed by Iran's
  great rival, Saudi Arabia. And Suleimani's lack of public profile here
  tells us one final thing about the Quds Force: controlling whether
  they come out of or remain in the shadows is all part of their game.
