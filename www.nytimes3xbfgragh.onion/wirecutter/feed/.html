Instead most TVs come preset in either an energy-saving mode that’s too dim or a vivid mode that’s wildly exaggerated. You’re expected to shuffle through a variety of picture modes with names like Standard, Sports, Game, Vivid, and Movie and choose which one is “the best.” This year, however, manufacturers such as LG, Samsung, and Vizio are trying to remove the guesswork by including the new <a href="https://www.experienceuhd.com/filmmakermode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filmmaker Mode</a>, which correctly adjusts the TV’s settings to show a movie “as the filmmaker intended.”</p>]]>

The convenience of online shopping makes browsing easier, but when you’re buying a couch sight unseen, it’s important to do your homework. After hundreds of hours of research, including visiting three furniture factories, interviewing industry experts, and parking ourselves on nearly every sofa we’ve seen, we can tell you exactly what separates a great sofa from a future curbside donation.
