Swaddling---wrapping a baby securely in a thin blanket---can help
minimize the startle reflex, replicate the coziness of the womb, and
calm a baby who's overstimulated. To find the best swaddles, we had five
families spend two weeks testing 11 of them with babies ranging in age
from 2 to 12 weeks, and talked to four birth and postpartum experts.
There's no single swaddle that will work for every baby, and the right
swaddle for one baby might even change between the newborn stage and
later months. Still, we found that the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30686/162165/4/86635/?merchant=BuyBuy\%20Baby}{Happiest
Baby Sleepea} is the most effective at keeping a baby securely wrapped,
is among the easiest for parents to use, and is safe and comfortable for
the baby.

The Sleepea is the most effective swaddle we tested. It keeps babies
snug and secure with a unique interior Velcro panel and it's safe,
comfortable, and easy to use.

The combination of a unique interior Velcro panel and a compressive
pouch makes the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30686/162165/4/86635/?merchant=BuyBuy\%20Baby}{Sleepea}
harder for babies to break out of than other swaddles, which rely on
just one layer to keep arms down. The Sleepea, made by child development
and sleep expert \href{https://www.happiestbaby.com/pages/dr-karp}{Dr.
Harvey Karp's} company, Happiest Baby, can be used with or without the
interior Velcro panel, and in the medium and large sizes the shoulders
unsnap to create optional armholes for one-arm-out or both-arms-out
transitional swaddling. Other nice features, like mesh panels for
ventilation and a roomy sack that promotes the frog position for a
baby's growing hips, also help make this our top choice.

\textbf{Material:} 95 percent organic cotton, 5 percent spandex, plus
polyester mesh\\
\textbf{Size:} small fits 5 to 12 pounds, up to about 20 inches; medium
fits 12 to 18 pounds, up to about 22 inches; large fits 18 to 26 pounds,
up to about 24 inches

This all-cotton swaddle uses less-restrictive exterior wings, and it has
armholes for extended wear. Its roomy cut makes diaper changes more
convenient. The Velcro is loud, however, and it's easier to escape from
than our top pick.

SleepSack Swaddle's} exterior wings may be easier for some babies to
escape from than the two layers of swaddling provided by the Sleepea,
and its Velcro panel is large and loud, but it's a solid choice if
you're looking for a swaddle for a baby who doesn't like a wrap as
form-fitting as the Sleepea. The Halo also includes dedicated armholes
for extended wear and a larger sack than the Sleepea's for more
convenient middle-of-the-night diaper changes.

\textbf{Material:} 100 percent cotton\\

*At the time of publishing, the price was \$20.

If you'd like to avoid the noise of Velcro, or your baby has proven
adept at breaking out of it, or they prefer keeping their hands closer
to their face, you may want to try the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30688/154051/4/86637/?merchant=BuyBuy\%20Baby}{Woombie
Air}. This swaddle doesn't have wings but instead simply zips up to
encase a baby from neck to toes. It is super quick and easy to use:
simply lay the baby inside and zip up the sack. The Woombie Air allows a
baby to move more freely within the swaddle than our other picks, but
may not work for babies who need a more restrictive swaddle. Also, it
doesn't have armholes, so can't be used for as long as our other picks.

\textbf{Material}: cotton-spandex blend\\
\textbf{Size:} preemie fits 3 to 6 pounds, 16 to 17 inches; newborn fits
5 to 13 pounds, 20 to 22 inches; ``big baby'' fits 14 to 19 pounds, 24
to 26 inches

I spoke with a handful of baby care experts, including
\href{https://www.bluegrassdoulas.com/about}{Rebecca Mercer}, LCCE, CD
(DONA), a Kentucky-based postpartum doula and infant care specialist and
co-founder of Bluegrass Doulas;
\href{https://www.hopebirthandbeyond.com/about-us}{Hope Staves}, MA, CD,

Weigand}, RN, MSN, IBCLC, a perinatal RN working at Adventist Health
Castle Hospital in Oahu, Hawaii.

I also pored over dozens of online reviews at company sites and Amazon,
making sure to take into account feedback from parents in almost any
type of baby-sleep situation. I consulted best-of roundups from popular
parenting resource sites like
\href{https://www.thebump.com/a/swaddling-blankets}{The Bump} and
\href{https://www.babylist.com/hello-baby/best-swaddles}{Babylist}, and
read in-depth reviews from baby gear bloggers, like
\href{https://fathercraft.com/sleepea-review/}{Fathercraft}. I also
looked for recalls from the \href{https://www.cpsc.gov}{Consumer Product
Safety Commission} (CPSC).

I reviewed safe-sleep guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics
as well. Though the AAP doesn't endorse any particular type of swaddle,
it states that
\href{https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx}{swaddles
are safe to use} as long as a baby is placed to sleep on their back, the
swaddle is not too tight, and swaddling is stopped as soon as a baby
begins trying to roll over.

As a parenting writer and a mom of three, I've handled my fair share of
baby items. In addition to putting these swaddles to the test with my
own infant, I recruited four other families to test swaddles with their
own babies, ranging in age from 2 to 12 weeks.

Especially in their first weeks of life, babies are nurtured by
\href{https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2018/04/26/swaddling-your-newborn-why-to-do-it-and-how-to-do-it-right/?noredirect=on\&utm_term=.a9599ef29f7e}{a
secure environment} that helps ease their transition into a big, bright
world outside the womb. These early months are often termed ``the fourth
trimester,'' an adjustment period for both babies and parents.

``A baby between 0 to 3 months is very different developmentally'' than
older babies, explained Rebecca Mercer, a Kentucky-based postpartum
doula and infant care specialist, ``and we do everything we can to try
to mimic the womb.'' Swaddling is one of the most effective ways to
achieve this, as wrapping a baby snugly inside of a blanket to limit
their movement helps reduce the startle reflex and mitigate stimulation.
``Inside the womb,'' Mercer said, ``{[}babies{]} are very tucked. They
can't go very far. When we're able to swaddle a baby, we offer
comfort.''

According to
\href{https://www.seattlechildrens.org/conditions/a-z/crying-baby-before-3-months-old/}{Seattle
Children's Hospital}, ``Swaddling is the most helpful technique for
calming crying babies. It also keeps your baby from waking up with a
\href{https://www.whattoexpect.com/baby-behavior/newborn-reflexes.aspx}{startle
reflex}.'' Swaddling also allows you to cover your baby while avoiding
any loose blankets or extra bedding in the crib, which is a
\href{http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/5/e20162938}{major
don't for safe sleep}.

Once a baby can roll from back to belly (usually between 4 and 6
months), swaddling can be
\href{http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/5/e20162938}{dangerous}
because it can
\href{http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/137/6/e20153275.full.pdf}{increase
the risk} (PDF) of suffocation or SIDS. (Though it's still fine to use a
swaddle that allows a baby to keep their arms free.) The AAP
\href{https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Swaddling-Is-it-Safe.aspx}{recommends}
parents stop swaddling by eight weeks, well before the baby even begins
to attempt to roll over.
\href{https://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-alternatives-to-baby-swaddling}{Some
experts} say about 3 months is the limit of swaddling age,
\href{https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/baby/when-to-stop-swaddling-your-baby}{others
say 4 to 5}. And, of course, swaddling isn't right for every baby.
``We're all different,'' Mercer said. ``There are some babies that
decide they don't handle swaddling well.'' Others may benefit from using
one type of swaddle in their first few weeks of life, and then might
graduate to a different (less restrictive) type of swaddle or swaddling
method (arms out instead of in, for example). For many, swaddling works
best as one tool that helps a baby settle into a consistent sleep
pattern.

We scoured Amazon, BuyBuy Baby, Target, and other retailers, read
threads in baby care forums like BabyCenter, and reached out to local
online mom groups to generate our original list of swaddles for testing.
We excluded swaddles that are considered ``transitional'' (usually less
restrictive models designed for older babies that are already rolling
over) or that don't successfully mimic the constriction of the womb and
more resemble sleep sacks or sleep suits.

There are four main types of swaddles: Traditional swaddling blankets,
which are large and thin and which the caregiver must
\href{https://www.adenandanais.com/blog/how-to-swaddle-a-baby}{manipulate
and wrap correctly} themselves; guided swaddling blankets (such as the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30692/150983/4/86647/?merchant=Amazon}{Miracle
Blanket}), which allow a caregiver to swaddle a baby without any Velcro,
zippers, or snaps; winged swaddles, which typically secure the baby's
body inside of a pouch and then hold their arms in place with Velcro
wings; and peanut swaddles, which hold the baby, arms and all, inside of
a slightly compressive zippered pouch. After reviewing parent feedback
and taking my own experience into account, we determined that a good
baby swaddle should be:

\textbf{Effective at swaddling a baby:}~Dedicated swaddles should take
time and guesswork out of the process compared with traditional
swaddling blankets, so we looked for those that are simple to use and
more likely to stay in place overnight. Although swaddling can be a
useful calming technique, it doesn't work for every baby, and factors
like the best arm position and optimal fabric can vary widely from one
baby to the next. While we noted any swaddles that seemed to calm our
babies in testing or promote a more restful sleep, those personal
results were only tangential to how we rated overall efficacy.

**Easy to use:~**Babies aren't the only ones who need sleep, so we
looked for swaddles that are easy for parents to use. We kept in mind
things like middle-of-the-night diaper changes and how much you might
need to use fine motor skills in a dark bedroom for things like snapping
and zipping---especially after multiple nights in a row of being up
every hour with a hungry newborn.

**Safe and fit well:~**One of the main safety concerns surrounding any
type of swaddle is the risk of loose material being pulled up over a
baby's face. While ultimately every swaddle has received some complaints
about this, we looked for models with fewer reports of this type or that
were specifically designed to minimize its occurrence. An additional
concern is that improper swaddling (if the material is too tight or the
body of the swaddle is too narrow) can
\href{https://hipdysplasia.org/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/hip-healthy-swaddling/}{lead
to hip dysplasia}. We paid careful attention to how each swaddle is
sized, how well it fits according to the height and weight
recommendations on the package, and how the design impacts safety and
health---including how easy it seems for a baby to break free, which can
leave loose material that poses a suffocation risk. We also checked for
any recalls or newsworthy safety concerns.

\textbf{Comfortable for the baby:}~Swaddles should feel soft to the
touch---made of cotton or a cotton blend, and should be comfortable for
the baby to wear, such that they don't constrict the baby in an
unnatural way or lead to overheating.

\textbf{Durable and easy to care for:}~Swaddles should hold up through
multiple washes.

Using the criteria above, we came up with the following 11 swaddles to
test:

We excluded swaddles from our list if they had only a handful of online
reviews, or if they appeared to be a knockoff of another swaddle already
on our list. We also excluded swaddles with uses that were too specific,
like arms-only straps or swaddle blankets meant specifically for use in
a stroller or car seat. While many of the swaddles we tested have at
least some ability to be used transitionally as a baby outgrows the need
to be swaddled, we decided not to include specifically transitional
swaddles.

I inspected and tested each swaddle on my own baby, who was around 12
weeks old when testing began. (Because she was beginning to roll over, I
tested with her only during supervised naps). Then I split the swaddles
between our four test panel families with babies ranging in age from 2
to 9 weeks, and they tested our finalists for two weeks.

Created by baby sleep expert
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/2018/04/18/magazine/harvey-karp-baby-mogul.html}{Dr.
Harvey Karp} as a standalone version of the sleep sack included with his
high-end

bassinet, the all-cotton
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30686/162165/4/86635/?merchant=BuyBuy\%20Baby}{Sleepea}
is designed to address common problems with other swaddles, including
easy breakout, overheating, too much constriction at the hips, loud
Velcro, and loose material near the baby's face. It relies on a unique
interior panel for an extra-secure arm wrap, plus an exterior zippered
pouch, creating a cozy, effective swaddle.

The Sleepea's combination of an interior band and exterior pouch make it
harder for babies to escape, and the simple design makes it easy and
fast for parents to get a baby swaddled.

Though the design of this swaddle helps keep the baby extra secure,
there's no such thing as a swaddle that's truly eliminated the
possibility of a tiny Houdini breaking free. We can say that the Sleepea
is escape-resistant, though, with a lower chance of a baby breaking free
mid-wear than many of the other swaddles we tested. The Velcro panel on
the inside of the sack creates an additional built-in security
feature---and even if a baby breaks free from the panel, their arms are
still secure inside the zippered sack. The design also means there's no
loose material, even if a baby has broken out of the panel, and this is
an outstanding safety measure.

The interior panel uses a thin strip of ``quiet Velcro,'' which isn't
silent but is definitely less loud than the traditional Velcro found on
some other swaddles we tested. The interior wings also use minimal
Velcro compared with other models, which makes the material less stiff
and more comfortable.

One mom of a 6-week-old who was part of our test group described the
Sleepea Swaddle as very user-friendly, noting, ``If the Velcro was
pulled tight enough, {[}my son{]} calmed instantly, was not able to
break the swaddle, and stayed asleep comfortably.'' Her son slept for
five-hour stretches at night while wearing this swaddle, longer than he
had been doing previously, the mom reported.

Made from 95 percent organic cotton, 5 percent spandex, and polyester
mesh, the Sleepea is softer and more lightweight than most of the other
swaddles we tested. It offers some compression without being too
constricting. It's more compressive than the Halo, our runner-up, but
not as much so as the Woombie Air, and has a roomy leg sack designed
with safe hip placement in mind. Two panels of polyester mesh (one at
the shoulder and another around the knees), offer ventilation to address
one of parents' biggest concerns about swaddling in general:
overheating. This was one of only two swaddles we tested that uses mesh
paneling for improved ventilation (the other being the Woombie Air), and
of the two, it uses more mesh in two strategic locations for better
ventilation.

This swaddle has a few features that allow it to grow with the baby. It
can be used without the interior panel, or with the interior panel
secured around the torso, and still provide comfort. This is great for a
baby who likes the secure feeling of being swaddled but wants more range
of motion with their hands or arms inside the sack, and makes the
Sleepea work more similarly to the Woombie, our also-great pick. The
shoulders of the medium and large sizes of the Sleepea are lined with
snaps, which you can undo to create armholes (similar to those built
into the Halo, our runner-up) to let one arm or both out, helping the
baby transition out of the swaddle as they grow.

There's no such thing as a swaddle that has truly eliminated the
possibility of a tiny Houdini breaking free.

Like our test panel participants, some reviewers found their babies
slept better when using this swaddle. One reviewer
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZTRGEH3B6MNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8\&ASIN=B079H8PS8P\&tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{writes},
``This is the most effective swaddle I've used so far and has allowed my
8 week old to sleep 7 hour stretches at night.'' Another reviewer
highlighted the superiority of the Sleepea's design,
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34YWZN7FCU88Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8\&ASIN=B079H8PS8P\&tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{noting},
``It keeps {[}my daughter's{]} arms neatly by her side and I like the
two way zipper for easier diaper changes.'' A reviewer for Fathercraft
\href{https://fathercraft.com/sleepea-review/}{shares} a preference for
this swaddle's design as well, saying, ``Sleepea's smart band and
zippered enclosure felt `snug' not too loose, not too tight. This was
definitely an improvement over some other sacks I've tried.''

\hypertarget{flaws-but-not-dealbreakers}{%
\subsection{Flaws but not
dealbreakers}\label{flaws-but-not-dealbreakers}}

While the Sleepea is billed as a ``5-second swaddle,'' we found that to
be true in only the most optimal conditions, namely when the baby was
asleep or nearly asleep while being put into it, and thus didn't resist
or squirm around at all. Outside of those instances, this swaddle was
still quick, easy, and intuitive to use, even if it's actually more like
a 15-second swaddle.

The two-way tail-to-tail zipper, which is a common feature in zip-up
swaddles, unzips from the top or bottom to facilitate easier diaper
changes, but the body of the sack is a little too narrow for this to
work well. Even when unzipping from the bottom, ``I had to pull too much
on baby's legs to get them out of the bottom of the sack to change the
diaper,'' said one of our test parents, who reverted to unzipping the
whole thing from the top. However, thanks again to that interior panel,
the wings can stay securely fastened during a diaper change, so
completely unswaddling the baby (which you have to do with some of the
other designs we tested) isn't necessary either.

For babies who need more freedom of movement or are ready to transition
to a one-arm or both-arms-out swaddle, the convertible shoulders of the
Sleepea are a clever feature. However, there's no way to cover the open
snaps, and the exposed stud of the plastic snaps may potentially create
some discomfort.

As with any swaddle that uses Velcro, you have to be mindful of securing
the Velcro before washing. If you don't secure it, the Velcro can snag
on the mesh panels and also catch on other items in the laundry.

One issue mentioned repeatedly among
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EYW1ZD70SZ6L?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{Amazon
reviewers} is that this model ``does run a tad bit short.'' When
choosing the right fit, size for length rather than weight. For babies
that are on the small side, this may create a different problem, which
is that the interior wings are then ill-fitting. One reviewer who loves
the Sleepea overall nevertheless
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ELAG1SSXCDC3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8\&ASIN=B079HH8CD1?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{mentions},
``The only issue is the Velcro straps that keep the baby's arms down are
too loose,'' even when pulling them as tight as possible. While the
Sleepea was designed to address many common safety issues of popular
swaddles, one reviewer
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34YWZN7FCU88Q?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{notes}
that, like other peanut-type swaddles without exterior wings, it
``bunches a little around the neck sometimes,'' an issue they resolved
by not zipping up the swaddle quite all the way to the top.

The popular
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30687/162166/4/86636/?merchant=BuyBuy\%20Baby}{Halo
SleepSack Swaddle}, essentially a wearable blanket with exterior
swaddling wings, is a good choice if you prefer a model that's cozy but
not as form-fitting. The all-cotton material (it's also available in
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30781/151090/4/86907/?merchant=Walmart}{organic
cotton} in the newborn size as well as a
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30696/150987/4/86646/?merchant=Amazon}{micro-fleece
version}) is
\href{https://www.sewingpartsonline.com/blog/411-cotton-vs-polyester-pros-cons/}{naturally}
less heat-trapping than the cotton-spandex blends of our other picks,
though the lack of mesh panels for ventilation and the extra layers of
material may make the swaddle less breathable overall. Like the Sleepea,
our main pick, the Halo has a two-way zipper, but its roomier leg sack
makes middle-of-the-night diaper changes a little easier to manage. The
Halo is also longer than the Sleepea in the equivalent size, which means
it can be used longer for arms-out swaddling as a baby grows or for
taller babies who don't fit in the Sleepea.

To use the Halo SleepSack Swaddle, you zip the baby into the wearable
blanket and secure their arms with the Velcro wings.

Many Amazon reviewers love this swaddle, and with large external wings
and a wide Velcro panel, some reviewers find this brand ideal for
hugging the baby around the arms and torso, creating a feeling of
comfort and security.

The Halo (right) has much larger wings and Velcro panels than the
Sleepea (left), though whether that's more or less effective for
swaddling is up to the baby. Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald

However, other reviewers, and some of the experts we spoke to, are put
off by such a broad swath of Velcro because it seems unnatural or too
restrictive. (One doula we interviewed said it reminded her of a
straitjacket.) The Velcro panel is also loud, especially compared with
the Sleepea's, making any repositioning or opening and closing of the
swaddle potentially disruptive to a sleepy baby.

Some reviewers, as well as our own test panel, found that the exterior
wings allow for a more natural swaddle experience, promoting placement
of hands over heart and even making it possible for a determined baby to
work a finger or fist up toward their mouth for better self-soothing.
Others found the exterior wings to be a detractor, because they make it
too easy for the baby to break free.

The Halo's dedicated armholes make it possible to use this swaddle for
longer than most others. When using the armholes, parents can wrap the
wings around the baby's chest for an arms-out swaddle that still
provides a secure hug around the baby's midsection. Like other swaddles
with Velcro, you'll want to remember to secure the Velcro wings before
washing.

Reviewers appreciate this swaddle's wearability. ``I love that they are
100\% cotton, breathable, and yet they keep {[}my daughter{]} warm at
night,''
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH53GRG1HBRHI?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{writes}
one Amazon reviewer. A labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum care

used it with her second child
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSS4OM4QPDOZA?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{notes},
``I love that they stay on, maintain their shape and quality and wash
easily while keeping him warm \ldots{} the lightweight cotton design is
great for most nights and can be layered with a flannel sleeper for
cooler temperatures.'' Others laud the
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27TW5D9HWE2G7?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{versatility}
of the exterior wings. While some reviewers
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MBCH6VA2M2Z5?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{call}
this model ``a new baby MUST HAVE,'' multiple reviewers experienced
issues with the Halo
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17U5ZEO4X0AW4?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{riding
up} and covering the baby's face. Halo's customer service said that if
this happens, the swaddle may be too big, the wings may need to be more
tightly wrapped, or the baby may prefer their arms out.

*At the time of publishing, the price was \$20.

For babies who may need a little more freedom of movement but still
benefit from the compression of a swaddle, the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30688/154051/4/86649/?merchant=BuyBuy\%20Baby}{Woombie
Air} is a great choice. It's a peanut swaddle, encasing a baby from neck
to toes in a single, simple pouch. Instead of Velcro wings, the sack
itself provides light compression and limits the startle reflex---though
not as much as the Sleepea or Halo wings do. Overall, the Woombie is the
closest-fitting swaddle among our picks but how constricting it is
depends on the size of your baby; you can't adjust it like you can our
other picks. Beneath the cotton-spandex material, the baby is freer to
move their limbs than with our other picks, and because this swaddle
simply zips the baby in a single pocket it's also the easiest to get a
baby into and out of. But because it's form-fitting, you need to take
the baby nearly all the way out for diaper changes.

The Woombie Air is a peanut swaddle, which means it encases a baby from
neck to toes in a pouch. It's simpler to use than swaddles with wings:
you just place the baby inside and zip.

One tester with an 11-week-old baby wrote, ``It seems like it provides
the most natural (womb-like) environment of swaddles that I've tried. My
son likes to hold his hands together and this swaddle really allowed him
to do so! He slept great in this one, especially at night.''

To address parents' concerns about babies overheating in a less
breathable cotton blend, the company added a small amount of mesh
paneling to the front of the Woombie Air. While this may be an
improvement from the design of the original Woombie, it still doesn't
provide as much ventilation as the mesh panels on the Sleepea.

\includegraphics{https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/baby-swaddles-lowres-5332-120x80.jpg}

The Woombie Air has small mesh panels in the front that may help keep a
baby from overheating, but they won't provide as much ventilation as the
larger mesh panels on the Sleepea. Photo: Kyle Fitzgerald

One of the features of this swaddle that our test panel didn't love is
the tighter neck. Without any wings to hold the arms in place, this
design is intentional, as it helps keep the material from pushing up and
covering the baby's face as they move their limbs beneath the fabric.
But some testers were concerned about the tightness of the neck and how
comfortable this specific feature might be, especially for larger
babies. Others found that some bunching of material around the shoulders
was still possible as the baby moved around within the sack.

For some Amazon reviewers, the Woombie Air provides the perfect fit. One
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNDZLITUTVIUR?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{writes}
that her daughter was ``too skinny for the halo swaddles, but {[}the
Woombie Air{]} was perfect and she started sleeping longer without
waking herself up.'' Another
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WJ74BWDXVPTN?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{calls}
it an ``amazing and effective alternative'' to Velcro swaddles. A few
owners
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RW741I3QUQRL?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{comment}
that the Woombie Air is especially good for babies who want to keep
their hands close to their face or mouth.

\hypertarget{the-competition}{%
\subsection{The competition}\label{the-competition}}

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30690/150981/4/86639/?merchant=Amazon}{Ergobaby
Original Swaddler} brings some innovative features to its design, but
one tester with a 7-week-old said it was initially ``slightly
confusing'' to figure out. The main point of confusion is a piece of
fabric inside the leg sack---called a ``healthy hip positioner''---that
fits over the diaper and Velcros internally. One tester noted there
``wasn't much airflow, and baby seemed overly warm.'' It's also hard to
contend with both the zipperless leg pouch and the positioner during a
diaper change.

\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30694/150985/4/86643/?merchant=Amazon}{The
Ollie Swaddle} was the most expensive (by at least \$20) of all the
swaddles we tested. With a unique shape (it's smaller than most
swaddles) and interesting design features (the bottom bands closed to
form the leg pouch), results for this model were mixed. One tester, the
mom of a 6-week-old, said, ``I had a hard time getting my daughter into
this swaddle---the pictures on the box were confusing.'' Another parent
in our test group, along with owners from several online reviews,
mentioned how easily their baby was able to slip one or both arms out of
the swaddle. Our testers also didn't like the banded pouch feature,
which is designed to allow the swaddle to grow with the baby and to
facilitate easier diaper changes. The mom of a 4-week-old explained she
had to undo the entire swaddle in order to change a diaper in the middle
of the night, and the ``quiet'' Velcro was still loud enough that it
woke up her baby.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30693/150984/4/86642/?merchant=Amazon}{Nested
Bean Zen Swaddle Classic} is the only weighted swaddle we tested. It
uses polymer beads in the front and in the tips of the wings to apply a
small (and \href{https://www.nestedbean.com/pages/faq}{safe}) amount of
pressure to the baby's torso when swaddled. The weighted center is
designed to be used over the chest (for smaller babies). The Nested Bean
has a smaller interior leg pocket inside of the main sack. Once the baby
outgrows the interior pocket, their legs get placed in the larger pouch.
While this model worked great for a smaller baby still using that
interior pouch, one larger baby in our test panel was able to kick the
swaddle open during the night, creating a safety issue.

The Velcro-less, zipper-less
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30692/150983/4/86647/?merchant=Amazon}{Miracle
Blanket} swaddle has a hardcore fan base, and two doulas we talked to
mentioned it by name as one of the primary swaddles they recommend.
However, its unique design comes with a steep learning curve; both
participants who tested this swaddle had to watch a YouTube video in
order to figure out how to use it, and it took some practice to get it
right. With long exterior wings, it also has the most material of the
models we tested. One parent, the mom of a 4-week-old, said the extra
material made it ``not very easy for middle of the night diaper
changes.''

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30695/150986/4/86644/?merchant=Amazon}{SwaddleMe
Original Swaddle} is a popular inexpensive option and one of the easiest
to find in big-box stores. The mom of a 4-week-old pointed out that
``sometimes my baby can work his way down in the material, causing it to
come up close to his mouth and nose.'' Without a zipper, it can also be
a little cumbersome to orchestrate a diaper change in the middle of the
night.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30691/150982/4/86640/?merchant=Amazon}{Love
to Dream Swaddle Up} is designed specifically to promote an arms-up
position for the baby. If a baby prefers to sleep with their arms at
their sides or in a hands-over-heart position, this particular swaddle
would most likely be uncomfortable.

Many Amazon reviewers complain that the
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30697/150988/4/86645/?merchant=Amazon}{Woombie
Original} has
\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD071FMDZ5DBM?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{sizing

\href{https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F5UKG8XIB19Q?tag=thewire06-20\&linkCode=xm2\&ascsubtag=YT78495}{too

up scrunched around the baby's neck}. It lacks the mesh panels of our
also-great pick, the Woombie Air, which is an improved version of the
Original.

The
\href{https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/30689/150980/4/86638/?merchant=Amazon}{Aden
+ Anais}~large muslin swaddle blankets have long been a popular
traditional swaddling option for many parents and come in an array of
prints, patterns, and colors. Several Wirecutter staffers have
successfully used Aden + Anais blankets to swaddle their children.
However, getting the technique down using a blanket (as opposed to a
dedicated swaddle) requires some instruction and practice, and for some
parents, there's just no getting the hang of it. ``These are great as a
blanket,'' said the mom of a 4-week-old, ``but they don't create a very
secure swaddle. My baby can get his arms out.''

\hypertarget{use-care-and-maintenance}{%
\subsection{Use, care, and maintenance}\label{use-care-and-maintenance}}

Use your swaddle as part of a safe sleep practice by securing all
Velcro, wings, snaps, and/or zippers. Always place a swaddled baby on
their back to sleep, in a crib or sleeping space that's free from
blankets, pillows, stuffed animals, or bumpers. Some experts say that
\href{https://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/cosleeping/}{bed-sharing
infants shouldn't be swaddled}. The AAP advises that as soon as a baby
begins trying to roll over, you should no longer swaddle them because of
the suffocation risk this creates.

Our picks are machine washable (the Sleepea and Woombie need to be
washed on delicate). You can tumble dry the Sleepea and Halo on low
heat, while the Woombie should be air-dried. Secure all Velcro tabs on
each swaddle before washing and drying to avoid snags.
