Although the Tribest isn&#x27;t the most powerful machine on paper—it has a weaker motor and the smallest cups of all our picks—it blends really well for most food prep tasks you&#x27;d need it for. Compared to the NutriBullet and Breville Boss To Go, smoothies from the Tribest are thinner due to the extra liquid needed to get a consistent blend. But it’s built to last and a solid performer if you don&#x27;t mind slightly thinner smoothies.</p><div class="d3ee5341 global-cob c8f144ae _0d728a80" data-scp="callout"><h4 class="d7e24e56" data-scp="callout_label">Upgrade pick</h4><div id="callout-intro-4-2" class="_3f3b59fc" data-gtm-element="callout" data-scp="callout_item"><div class="_110e870a"><div class="f84ca110"><div class="_983cb06a"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59236?merchant=Amazon" class="_3f942d3a product-merchant-link-button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59236?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_image" data-scp="callout_image"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Breville Boss To Go" itemProp="image" data-src="https://d1b5h9psu9yexj.cloudfront.net/17377/fullsize.jpg" width="570" height="380" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e"/></figure></a></div><div class="_58a86362"><h3 class="ecea350c"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59236?merchant=Amazon" class="product-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Breville Boss To Go" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59236?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_name" data-scp="callout_product">Breville Boss To Go</a></h3><h2 class="_13808af6"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59236?merchant=Amazon" class="product-merchant-link-button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="For a silkier smoothie" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59236?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_title" data-scp="callout_title">For a silkier smoothie</a></h2><p class="_100e05de" data-scp="callout_description">Super thick smoothies aren’t a problem for this sleek and powerful blender.</p><div data-scp="callout_sources"><h4 class="cb2f8e95">Buying Options</h4><div class="_61c45eaf product-pricebox-0" data-source-id-order="0" data-country-code="US"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59236?merchant=Amazon" class="c00a1861 product-merchant-link-button" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59236?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_button"><span>$160</span>*<!-- --> from <span>Amazon</span></a></div><div class="_61c45eaf product-pricebox-1" data-source-id-order="1" data-country-code="US"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/156194/4/59236?merchant=Williams-Sonoma" class="c00a1861 product-merchant-link-button" data-store="Williams-Sonoma" data-vars-store="Williams-Sonoma" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/156194/4/59236?merchant=Williams-Sonoma" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_button"><span>$160</span> from <span>Williams-Sonoma</span></a></div><p class="f5ea3dab" data-scp="callout_disclaimer">*At the time of publishing, the price was <!-- -->$150<!-- -->.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="_0acd69c0" data-scp="callout_pointer"></div></div><p>The <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59218/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17377/152249/4/59218/?merchant=Amazon">Breville Boss To Go</a> offers smoother blending, sleeker design, and a better travel lid than our top pick.

We looked for blenders with a small footprint to accommodate small apartments and dorms or people who don’t want a lot of countertop clutter. A sturdy cup with secure travel lid is a major plus, especially for commuters. Finally, we scoured user reviews to get a read on durability and long-term reliability.</p><p>Most importantly, a personal blender needs to make relatively smooth purees in about a minute. In our testing, we found more powerful blenders could puree thick mixtures and blend faster. Smaller machines got hot and smelled of burning after making thick smoothies. Smaller blenders needed up to ¾ cup more liquid than the more powerful models to make a continuous vortex, which resulted in thin, watery smoothies.</p><p>All the models we brought in to test except for one were hands-free: once the cup was locked into place, you could take your hands off the machine. This is a superior design to cups that need to be held in place, as a minute can seem like a long time when you can’t step away. While you shouldn’t leave the blender running unattended, you can still multitask while making your smoothie.</p><figure id="attachment_11269" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Two men pointing at a personal blender." data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/personalblenders-lowres-5348.jpg" width="630" height="420" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e size-full wp-image-48557"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> Matt Shook of Juiceland (right) considering the variable speed dial of the Vitamix S-55.</figcaption></figure><p>We found personal blenders that had only one speed and powered on by engaging the cup with the base were the easiest to use. High-priced personal blenders offer speed controls and pre-programmed settings, but we appreciate a no-frills user interface. Variable speed dials didn’t improve the user experience. In fact, having to choose a speed or program added an unnecessary step to what should be simple.</p><p>Since these are single-serving blenders, we wanted them to be small enough to leave on the counter because you’re more likely to use an appliance if it’s in sight and accessible. If you already have a regular blender and you’re looking for a second appliance to handle smaller jobs with less cleanup, a small footprint is even more important.</p><p>Cups that are comfortable to hold with secure travel lids that snap shut are an added bonus for commuters. Two of our picks have lids that seal tight and can be tossed into a backpack or tote. Although the openings in these travel lids are pretty small across the board, our smoothie drinkers in the test kitchen all agreed they would use a straw with extra thick smoothies. All of our picks should fit in most car cup holders.</p><p>To get an accurate read on the longevity of these machines, we sifted through the glut of online reviews to find patterns of wear and malfunction. We’re confident that our picks, when used responsibly and within their abilities, will last a long time.</p></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="how-we-tested"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="how-we-tested-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">How we tested<button class="_2786f782" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="how-we-tested-panel" class="_11cbb9b1" aria-labelledby="how-we-tested" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><figure id="attachment_11270" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Men making a smoothie in top pick personal blender." data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/personalblenders-lowres-5338.jpg" width="630" height="420" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e size-full wp-image-48558"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> Matt Shook of Juiceland blending a thick banana and berry smoothie in our top pick, the NutriBullet Pro.</figcaption></figure><p>To see how these blenders could handle a thick smoothie, we blended frozen bananas, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and juice for the recommended running time of each specific model. If any blender couldn’t make a puree in that amount of time (usually one minute) or the base began to get noticeably hot, it was disqualified.</p><p>For round two, we blended curly kale and water, then strained the mixture through a fine sieve. We evaluated the amount of solids and fibers as well as particle size. To see if these blenders could tackle tough fiber, we made a smoothies with ½-inch-thick pieces of ginger and frozen peaches (all the smoothies from this test had noticeable fibers). We also made a hearty shake from dates, banana, peanut butter, ice, and almond milk.

We also tried to drink thick smoothies from the opening in the lids.</p><p>We took decibel readings while the blenders were full and running since we read some complaints about the motors being too loud. All the blenders ran around the same noise level, between 92 and 98 decibels 5 inches away from the machine. (This is about the noise level of a garbage disposal.) There was only one exception: the Jamba Juice Quiet Blend, which has a large plastic muffler that decreased the noise by 10 decibels. Noise level didn’t account for pitch, though. One of our dismissals was so high-pitched, we winced every time we ran it.</p></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="our-pick-nutribullet-pro-900"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="our-pick-nutribullet-pro-900-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">Our pick: NutriBullet Pro 900<button class="_2786f782" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="our-pick-nutribullet-pro-900-panel" class="_11cbb9b1" aria-labelledby="our-pick-nutribullet-pro-900" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Top pick and to-go container on counter with ingredients." data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/personalblenders-lowres-6563.jpg" width="630" height="420" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e alignnone size-full wp-image-48560"/></figure><div class="d3ee5341 global-cob ef50707a c8f144ae" data-scp="callout"><h4 class="d7e24e56" data-scp="callout_label">Our pick</h4><div id="callout-chapter-1-1" class="_3f3b59fc" data-gtm-element="callout" data-scp="callout_item"><div class="_110e870a"><div class="f84ca110"><div class="_983cb06a"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59234?merchant=Nutribullet" class="_3f942d3a product-merchant-link-button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59234?merchant=Nutribullet" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_image" data-scp="callout_image"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="NutriBullet Pro 900" itemProp="image" data-src="https://d1b5h9psu9yexj.cloudfront.net/17375/NutriBullet-Pro-900-Series_20180621-192642_full.jpeg" width="570" height="380" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e"/></figure></a></div><div class="_58a86362"><h3 class="ecea350c"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59234?merchant=Nutribullet" class="product-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="NutriBullet Pro 900" data-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59234?merchant=Nutribullet" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_name" data-scp="callout_product">NutriBullet Pro 900</a></h3><h2 class="_13808af6"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59234?merchant=Nutribullet" class="product-merchant-link-button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The best personal blender for most people" data-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59234?merchant=Nutribullet" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_title" data-scp="callout_title">The best personal blender for most people</a></h2><p class="_100e05de" data-scp="callout_description">Powerful, easy to use, and convenient, this personal blender will save time in the morning so you can get on your way.</p><div data-scp="callout_sources"><h4 class="cb2f8e95">Buying Options</h4><div class="_61c45eaf product-pricebox-0" data-source-id-order="0" data-country-code="US"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59234?merchant=Nutribullet" class="c00a1861 product-merchant-link-button" data-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59234?merchant=Nutribullet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_button"><span>$90</span>*<!-- --> from <span>Nutribullet</span></a></div><div class="_61c45eaf product-pricebox-1" data-source-id-order="1" data-country-code="US"><a href="https://shop-links.co/1669687503926205275" class="c00a1861 product-merchant-link-button" data-store="Bed Bath &amp; Beyond" data-vars-store="Bed Bath &amp; Beyond" data-vars-outbound-link="https://shop-links.co/1669687503926205275" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_button"><span>$80</span> from <span>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</span></a></div><p class="f5ea3dab" data-scp="callout_disclaimer">*At the time of publishing, the price was <!-- -->$125<!-- -->.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Out of the models we tested, the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59216/?merchant=Nutribullet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17375/162800/4/59216/?merchant=Nutribullet">NutriBullet Pro 900</a> has the best balance of power, ease of use, and price. It blended everything we threw at it without straining. The Pro comes with a secure-fitting travel lid, and the large cup has a blending capacity of 24 ounces.

NutriBullet Pro comes with a limited one-year warranty, but a four-year extended warranty is available.</p><p>The NutriBullet Pro had no problem blending thick, spoonable smoothies. Our banana-berry smoothie came out lump-free. The kale puree wasn’t the finest blend we saw, but it wasn’t as fibrous as the kale from the Nutri Ninja. The NutriBullet blended dates well, leaving only a few small, pleasantly chewy pearls in the bottom of the cup that didn’t clog the straw. None of the personal blenders did an exceptional job on fresh ginger fiber, but that’s an extremely tough thing to break down. Matt Shook of Juiceland was impressed with the force and smooth results of the NutriBullet.</p><figure id="attachment_11273" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Thick date shake in container with no top" data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/personalblenders-lowres-6600.jpg" width="630" height="420" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e size-full wp-image-48561"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> The NutriBullet blends thick mixtures, like this date shake, without straining.</figcaption></figure><aside class="_5df8cec5"><p data-scp="pullquote">It blended everything we threw at it without straining.</p></aside><p>The travel lid on the NutriBullet screws on tight and a hinged plastic cap snaps over the opening to make it easy for commuters to travel without the risk of spilling all over themselves. We shook the sealed cup over the sink and saw no leakage. We will be testing the effectiveness of the travel lid long-term to see how it fares in a backpack or a tote on hectic commutes.</p><p>The “colossal” 32-ounce NutriBullet blending cup has 24 ounces (three cups) of blending capacity, which is plenty of room for a satisfying smoothie. Our runner-up pick, the Tribest PB-150, only allows for 300 ml, or just over 10 ounces (or 1¼ cups).</p><p>The NutriBullet Pro is intuitive and simple to use straight out of the box. There aren’t any dials or buttons to navigate. The motor is engaged when the blending cup is twisted onto the base, and it has one speed. Unlike some other models we tested, the same blade assembly works on all the different cup sizes included (depending on where you get it, there’s a variety of 32-ounce, 24-ounce, and “short” cups), so there’s no guesswork about what goes where.</p><p>At around $80, the NutriBullet Pro isn’t cheap, but it’s in the midrange of what you can pay for a personal blender. We tested models four times the price and found they don’t offer much more than speed variation and a die cast metal drive shaft (the part that turns the blade). The drive shaft on the NutriBullet is rubber and plastic. We also looked at blenders as inexpensive as $25, but these offered weak motors and leaky gaskets.</p><aside class="_5df8cec5"><p data-scp="pullquote">The NutriBullet Pro is intuitive and simple to use straight out of the box.</p></aside><p>We think the Pro is worth the price increase over the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/8953/162799/4/59219/?merchant=Nutribullet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-store="Nutribullet" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/8953/162799/4/59219/?merchant=Nutribullet">original NutriBullet</a> 600-watt model.

Later that year, after an initial investigation, the Consumer Product Safety Commission concluded that there was no reason for a recall. In September of 2016, Consumer Reports restored the NutriBullet Pro to their product rankings, giving it an overall score of “good.” We think a stress test of that magnitude is unrealistic. Personal blenders aren’t meant to crush large cubes of ice over and over again. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/nutribullet-pro-900/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CNET</a> conducted stress tests on the NutriBullet Pro and found no problems of breakage or malfunction.</p></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="runner-up-tribest-pb-150"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="runner-up-tribest-pb-150-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">Runner-up: Tribest PB-150<button class="_2786f782" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="runner-up-tribest-pb-150-panel" class="_11cbb9b1" aria-labelledby="runner-up-tribest-pb-150" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Runner-up pick on counter with ingredients" data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/personalblenders-lowres-6576.jpg" width="630" height="420" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e alignnone size-full wp-image-48562"/></figure><div class="d3ee5341 global-cob c8f144ae" data-scp="callout"><h4 class="d7e24e56" data-scp="callout_label">Runner-up</h4><div id="callout-chapter-2-1" class="_3f3b59fc" data-gtm-element="callout" data-scp="callout_item"><div class="_110e870a"><div class="f84ca110"><div class="_983cb06a"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17376/53728/4/59235?merchant=Amazon" class="_3f942d3a product-merchant-link-button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17376/53728/4/59235?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_image" data-scp="callout_image"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Tribest PB-150" itemProp="image" data-src="https://d1b5h9psu9yexj.cloudfront.net/17376/fullsize.jpg" width="570" height="380" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e"/></figure></a></div><div class="_58a86362"><h3 class="ecea350c"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17376/53728/4/59235?merchant=Amazon" class="product-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tribest PB-150" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17376/53728/4/59235?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_name" data-scp="callout_product">Tribest PB-150</a></h3><h2 class="_13808af6"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17376/53728/4/59235?merchant=Amazon" class="product-merchant-link-button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Great for small batches" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17376/53728/4/59235?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_title" data-scp="callout_title">Great for small batches</a></h2><p class="_100e05de" data-scp="callout_description">This helpful personal blender will act as a sous chef to your full-sized blender, tackling smaller jobs.</p><div data-scp="callout_sources"><h4 class="cb2f8e95">Buying Options</h4><div class="_61c45eaf product-pricebox-0" data-source-id-order="0" data-country-code="US"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17376/53728/4/59235?merchant=Amazon" class="c00a1861 product-merchant-link-button" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17376/53728/4/59235?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_button"><span>$60</span> from <span>Amazon</span></a></div><div class="_61c45eaf product-pricebox-1" data-source-id-order="1" data-country-code="US"><a href="https://shop-links.co/1669688264016484259" class="c00a1861 product-merchant-link-button" data-store="Bed Bath &amp;

While the S-55 blended thick ingredients into a super-smooth puree, the strong motor also caused the blender to turn and move across the counter in repeated tests using one small frozen banana, 4 ounces of frozen berries, and and 6 ounces of orange juice. We reached out to Vitamix for comment about this and their chef recommended using the less convenient 40-ounce container with tamper and using pre-sliced frozen items. Vitamix also suggested, “The movement could also have something to do with the surface you are blending on. If it is more of a granite top or a slicker surface, the machine may be more inclined to move.” However, this is still problematic as many people have smooth, granite countertops. We also had a difficult time figuring out the controls. Matt uses Vitamix blenders in his juice shops, and he couldn’t figure out the fussy, complicated interface in which you need to turn the dial and push it in. We disqualified the S-55 after the first round.</p><p>The <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17388/53788/4/59233/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/17388/53788/4/59233/?merchant=Amazon">Bella Rocket</a> leaked from the first test and was disqualified before the second round.</p></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="sources"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="sources-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">Sources<button class="_2786f782" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="sources-panel" class="_11cbb9b1 _5a4f94c3" aria-labelledby="sources" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><ol class="_0a22c981"><li class="dff58e0e" data-scp="sources_item"><p data-scp="sources_content">Julie Morris, <a href="http://www.juliemorris.net/" target="_blank" title="superfood chef">superfood chef</a>, interview</p></li><li class="dff58e0e" data-scp="sources_item"><p data-scp="sources_content"><a href="https://www.cookscountry.com/equipment_reviews/1642-personal-blenders?ref=new_search_experience_1&amp;extcode=MASKD00L0" target="_blank" title="Personal Blenders">Personal Blenders</a>, Cook&#x27;s Country (subscription required)<!-- -->, November 1, 2015</p></li><li class="dff58e0e" data-scp="sources_item"><p data-scp="sources_content"><a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/products/blender/ratings-overview/" target="_blank" title="Blenders">Blenders</a>, Consumer Reports (subscription required)</p></li></ol></div></section></div></div><div class="_1792b0f9" data-scp="author_bios"><a id="author-bios"></a><h2 class="_0e43a869" data-testid="author-bio-title">About your <!-- -->guide</h2><div><div class="a3d38f2d a849d5c8"><img class="_02020200 _965b8a3c" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/stockton-lesley.jpg" alt="Lesley Stockton" data-testid="author-image"/><div><p class="_1524b65a">Lesley Stockton</p><div class="d5778bcb " data-scp="social"><a href="mailto:notes@wirecutter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="a64f8c7e" data-gtm-trigger="contact_icon_email"><svg data-icon="email" class="_449e75e4" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 20 15" version="1.1"><g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g transform="translate(-47.000000, -357.000000)" fill="#999999" data-testid="email-fill-area"><g transform="translate(30.000000, 227.000000)"><g transform="translate(17.000000, 130.000000)"><path d="M18.523,3.316 L18.535,3.327 L10.679,9.761 C10.482,9.921 10.239,10.002 10,10.002 C9.76,10.002 9.517,9.921 9.32,9.761 L1.464,3.327 L1.476,3.316 C1.453,3.3 1.445,3.277 1.427,3.259 L1.427,1.784 L2.963,1.784 L10,7.545 L17.037,1.784 L18.572,1.784 L18.572,3.259 C18.554,3.277 18.546,3.3 18.523,3.316 L18.523,3.316 Z M0,15 L20,15 L20,0 L0,0 L0,15 Z"></path></g></g></g></g></svg></a></div></div></div><div class="_908e5a4e" data-testid="author-bio-text"><p>Lesley Stockton is a senior staff writer reporting on all things cooking and entertaining for Wirecutter.

We reached out to Vitamix for comment about this and their chef recommended using the less convenient 40-ounce container with tamper and using pre-sliced frozen items. Vitamix also suggested, “The movement could also have something to do with the surface you are blending on. If it is more of a granite top or a slicker surface, the machine may be more inclined to move.” However, this is still problematic as many people have smooth, granite countertops.
