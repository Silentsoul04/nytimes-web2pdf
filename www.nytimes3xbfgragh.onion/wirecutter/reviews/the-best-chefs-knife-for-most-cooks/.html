Thanks to Tojiro’s extremely sharp edge, super-hard steel, quality construction, and affordable price, this model is one of the best values in Japanese-made knives. The flat belly curve makes this chef’s knife ideal if you use a push-pull cutting motion, and it’s excellent for fine cuts and paper-thin slices of vegetables and meat. The Tojiro DP F-808 is thinner and more brittle than our top pick, so its edge is more vulnerable to microscopic chips when you use it on dense vegetables like butternut squash. Although we think the Tojiro DP F-808 is a great knife, it needs a little more TLC than the Mac MTH-80.</p><div class="d3ee5341 global-cob c8f144ae _0d728a80" data-scp="callout"><h4 class="d7e24e56" data-scp="callout_label">Also great</h4><div id="callout-intro-5-3" class="_3f3b59fc" data-gtm-element="callout" data-scp="callout_item"><div class="_110e870a"><div class="f84ca110"><div class="_983cb06a"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9613/27406/4/51653?merchant=Amazon" class="_3f942d3a product-merchant-link-button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9613/27406/4/51653?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_image" data-scp="callout_image"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Wüsthof Classic Ikon 4596/20" itemProp="image" data-src="https://d1b5h9psu9yexj.cloudfront.net/9613/W%C3%BCsthof-Classic-Ikon-459620_20170926-175702_fullsize.jpg" width="570" height="380" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e"/></figure></a></div><div class="_58a86362"><h3 class="ecea350c"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9613/27406/4/51653?merchant=Amazon" class="product-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wüsthof Classic Ikon 4596/20" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9613/27406/4/51653?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_name" data-scp="callout_product">Wüsthof Classic Ikon 4596/20</a></h3><h2 class="_13808af6"><a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9613/27406/4/51653?merchant=Amazon" class="product-merchant-link-button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="A classic German knife" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9613/27406/4/51653?merchant=Amazon" data-gtm-trigger="callout_product_link_title" data-scp="callout_title">A classic German knife</a></h2><p class="_100e05de" data-scp="callout_description">This classic German knife is best if you prefer a heftier model for heavy-duty tasks.

Compared with the other forged German knives we tested, the Classic Ikon’s thinner blade cut more smoothly through butternut squash and carrots. We liked how easily it maneuvered around curves when cutting away butternut squash skin and citrus rinds. The Classic Ikon 4596/20’s blade is made of softer steel than that of our top pick, the Mac MTH-80, which means it will dull faster. Like all the German knives we tested, this Wüsthof is also heavier than our top pick, weighing 9 ounces—2.5 ounces more than the Mac.</p></section><div class="_3b43c331" data-scp="sbs_callout"><h3

Of all the pieces in a cutlery set, the chef’s knife is the most versatile and gets the most use.</p><p>Most people already have knives in their kitchen. But if you have an old knife set or a hodge-podge of hand-me-downs that aren’t cutting it anymore, it’s probably time for an upgrade. Likewise, if your once-nice knife has been used and abused and never sharpened, or sharpened improperly, it’s time for a new one. Dull kitchen knives aren’t only a bummer to use, they’re also more dangerous than a razor-sharp edge. A sharp knife is more precise, and you run less of a chance of the blade slipping off your food and into your finger.</p><aside class="_5df8cec5"><p data-scp="pullquote">Of all the pieces in a cutlery set, the chef’s knife is the most versatile and gets the most use.</p></aside><p>Maybe you’re on a budget and outfitting your first kitchen. Since an 8-inch chef’s knife can tackle 90 percent of cutting jobs, you can sidestep the sticker shock of an entire knife set by getting one good chef’s knife to use until you generate more funds to build out your cutlery collection.</p><p>If you’ve only ever used a German-style stainless steel knife, you may want a model—like our main and runner-up picks—made in Japan from high-carbon steel that will stay sharp longer.</p><p>Most chef’s knives you’ll find come in two styles: German and Western-style, double-edged Japanese (also called <em>gyuto</em>).

The belly of the blade has a pronounced curve that tapers to a sharp tip, which is best if you prefer to cut using a <a href="#how-to-use-a-chefs-knife">rocking motion</a> (meaning the knife never leaves the cutting board, and you use the belly curve to slice through food). Wüsthof and Zwilling J.A. Henckels are the most popular German knife producers.</li><li>Most German knives have a bolster—a thick metal cuff—between the blade and handle. Unlike Japanese knives, some German knives have full bolsters that extend all the way to the blade edge. Full bolsters add weight to the knife and require a professional sharpening service to grind away the extra steel at the heel of the blade.</li><li>German knives generally weigh more and have thicker blades than their Japanese counterparts, making them great for tough jobs like breaking lobsters and splitting bone-in chicken breasts.</li><li>Their blades have an even bevel and are generally made of softer steel, so they tend to lose an edge quicker. But the softer steel makes German knives more resistant to chipping.</li></ul><p><strong>Western-style Japanese</strong> <strong>(gyuto)</strong></p><ul><li>Gyutos generally have thinner blades with flatter belly curves than German knives, and taper to a very sharp tip. The flat belly provides the most control if you cut using a <a href="#how-to-use-a-chefs-knife">push-pull motion</a> (meaning the blade leaves the board after each cut, and you push the knife forward and down, or pull it back and down, to slice through food).</li><li>Unlike with German knives, you’ll never find a gyuto with a full bolster that extends to the edge. The lack of extra steel lets you sharpen the knife yourself, because you can evenly grind the edge all the way to the heel on a home sharpener or whetstone.</li><li>Because gyutos are thinner and made of hard carbon steel, their edge takes a much more acute bevel angle, and they tend to stay sharper longer than German knives. This design makes gyutos great for paper-thin slices and precise cuts. But high-carbon steel can develop rust easier than stainless steel, so Japanese gyutos require more care than German knives. It’s important to wash and dry the knife thoroughly after use (especially after cutting acidic fruits and vegetables).</li></ul></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="how-we-picked"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="how-we-picked-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">How we picked<button class="_2786f782" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="how-we-picked-panel" class="_11cbb9b1" aria-labelledby="how-we-picked" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><figure id="attachment_16705" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="15 Knives lined up on a baking sheet.

For this update we looked at new releases since 2014, more knives from the producers of our top pick and runner-up pick, and the 8-inch chef’s knife from one of our <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-knife-set/#high-end-knife-set" rel="noopener" target="_blank">knife set recommendations</a>.</p><aside class="_5df8cec5"><p data-scp="pullquote">Determining the “ideal” knife for any one person is both objective and subjective.</p></aside><p>We immediately ruled out any small-batch blade crafters, since forging a knife by hand is time consuming, costly, and usually a custom-order affair. You also won’t see <em>santoku</em> knives in this guide; santokus have shorter blades, generally 6 or 7 inches, that limit their ability to cut through large vegetables with one cut. And since a chef’s knife is an essential piece of kitchen equipment, we wanted to keep our picks accessible for most budgets, so knives with price tags above $200 didn’t make the cut.</p><p>Determining the “ideal” knife for any one person is both objective and subjective. A chef’s knife is the main workhorse in your kitchen-cutlery arsenal, tackling 80 to 90 percent of cutting tasks. It’s an extension of your hand that can slice and dice most vegetables, chop a mound of herbs, and handle simple meat cuts like cubing beef or slicing chicken into strips. So factors such as sharpness, edge retention, durability, versatility, and easy maintenance are key to the performance of any good chef’s knife. But things like comfort, weight, balance, and price are mostly personal preference. As New York Times food editor Sam Sifton told us during testing, “[A good knife] is the balance of utility and the thing that moves your heart.”</p><p><strong>What to look for in a chef’s knife</strong><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="" width="630" height="420" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-anatomy-120x80.jpg" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e alignnone size-full wp-image-16708" data-sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-anatomy.jpg 630w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-anatomy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-anatomy-570x380.jpg 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-anatomy-330x220.jpg 330w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-anatomy-200x134.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-anatomy-120x80.jpg 120w"/></figure></p><p><strong>Sharpness</strong></p><p>A brand-new knife comes with what’s called a “factory edge,” which is usually very sharp. The edge should be keen enough to slice through paper straight out of the box. Your knife should remain sharp through moderate use for six to 12 months as long as you hone it regularly, wash and dry it by hand after each use, and store it so the edge doesn’t get dinged up. (For more on knife care, see our <a href="#how-to-keep-your-knife-like-a-pro">care and maintenance</a> discussion.) You don’t have as much control with a dull edge, which increases both your prep time and your chances of cutting yourself.</p><p><strong>Edge retention, steel hardness, and durability</strong></p><p>A crazy-sharp factory edge isn’t worth much if it dulls quickly. Good edge retention relies on a combination of steel composition and hardness, blade thickness, and bevel angle. (Also <a href="http://bladetest.infillplane.com/html/microstructure.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">microstructure</a>, but that’s super-technical stuff that we won’t get into here.) When a blade is thin and made from a hard steel, the edge can take and hold a tight angle. Read more in <a href="#about-blade-steel">About blade steel</a>.</p><p><strong>Length</strong></p><p>Chef’s knife blades range from 6 to 14 inches long. We think 8 inches is the perfect length for most people because it’s enough to halve large vegetables but still manageable for most home cooks. Brendan McDermott, chef instructor of knife skills at Kendall College, said, “I tend to always tell people to go bigger rather than smaller, but I think an 8-inch chef knife is a happy medium and perfect for almost anybody.”</p><p><strong>Bolster</strong></p><p>Bolsters are metal cuffs that can help balance knives with a heavy blade—such as the Wüsthof Classic Ikon—where you want more weight in the handle. A full bolster extends to the heel of the blade, while a half bolster doesn’t. For lighter knives such as gyutos, a bolster isn’t necessary. For this guide, we chose to exclude full-bolstered knives from our tests. Full bolsters make sharpening your knife more difficult, because eventually you’ll need to find a professional sharpening service to grind away the extra steel at the heel of the blade and maintain a flat edge.</p><p><strong>Forged or stamped blade</strong></p><p>Blades are either forged or stamped, and both methods can produce high- or low-quality knives.</p><p>Most mass-produced Western-forged knives are drop-forged, meaning the manufacturer heats a blank of steel to an extremely high temperature and then pounds it into the shape of a blade with a high-pressure hammer. Stamped blades, as the name suggests, are punched out of sheet metal before further refinement and sharpening. The quality of stamped blades varies widely, from the flimsy knives found at grocery stores to our top pick and runner-up. Knife makers like Mac and Tojiro heat-treat their blades to make them just as strong as forged steel.</p><p><strong>Balance</strong></p><aside class="_5df8cec5"><p data-scp="pullquote">&quot;An 8-inch chef knife is a happy medium and perfect for almost anybody.” —Brendan McDermott, Kendall College</p></aside><p>Knife balance means different things to different people. The blade, handle, and sometimes a bolster all contribute to a knife’s weight distribution. Some people want a blade-heavy knife, while others think the blade and the handle should be the same weight. A half-bolster or bolsterless knife will be more blade-heavy, whereas a full bolster throws more weight to the handle. Balance boils down to personal preference. If you’re not sure what kind of balance you prefer, go to a kitchen store and handle as many knives as possible to see what feels right.</p><p><strong>Comfort</strong></p><p>The best knives have handles that fit comfortably in the hand. The feel depends on the size and shape of your hand and the way you grip the knife. Try to get your hands on as many knives as possible to find a good fit. If you can, cut some vegetables to look for knuckle clearance—nothing is quite as annoying as banging your knuckles on the board while chopping. Just like balance, comfort is a personal thing.</p><figure id="attachment_16710" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="" data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-dialo-lowres-3516.jpg" width="630" height="420" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e size-full wp-image-56777"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> When holding a chef’s knife, you should have enough clearance between the handle and the cutting board to prevent your knuckles from hitting the board.<!-- --> <span class="wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit">Photo: Michael Hession</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What’s a tang and is it important?</strong></p><p>The tang is the piece of metal inside the handle. Many big knife makers claim that a full tang extending through the whole handle helps balance the knife. Brendan McDermott told us he agreed: “Having the full tang really helps balance the blade so the handle and the blade can remain at an even balance.”</p><p>Chad Ward argues in <em>An Edge in the Kitchen</em> that a full tang is unnecessary since knife balance is largely personal preference. That said, most of the chef’s knives we tested had full tangs with riveted handles. We think this design is so common because the full tang has stood as a benchmark of quality among both knife makers and cooks.</p><p><strong>What about dimpled blades?</strong></p><p>Some chef’s knives have oval dimples carved just above the edge. This granton edge, as it’s called, has long been a common feature on slicing and santoku knives. Knife makers claim the air pockets keep food from sticking to the blade. Even though our top pick has a granton edge, we don’t find dimples to be very effective at keeping food from clinging to a knife. But they certainly don’t hurt, either.</p><p>We couldn’t test all of the possible contenders that fit our criteria, so we focused on popular, widely available knives. For our 2017 update, we brought in seven new knives, plus four past contenders, to test against our top picks. In total over the years, we have tested 21 knives that all had an 8-inch blade, carried a price tag of $200 or less, lacked a full bolster, and came with recommendations from experts and trusted editorial sources.</p></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="how-we-tested"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="how-we-tested-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0"

It was the standout favorite for all our testers, regardless of their cutting style or the size of their hands. We found it had the best weight and balance; it felt more agile than the German models and more durable than the thin Japanese gyutos. The MTH-80’s blade shape strikes the perfect middle ground between German and Japanese chef’s knives, curved just enough for rocking but still straight enough for push-pull choppers. It’s the only knife we tested that I can safely recommend to most people without reservations.</p><p>Out of the box, this Mac model sliced straight through paper, which is something our previous pick, the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21661/118420/4/64650/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21661/118420/4/64650/?merchant=Amazon">Victorinox Fibrox Pro 8-Inch Chef’s Knife</a>, couldn’t manage.

The cut edges of basil stayed mostly green with very little oxidation, meaning the Mac’s razor-sharp edge broke very few of the herb’s cells. To be honest, all the Japanese knives did a superb job on our basil test, because they’re sharper and thinner, whereas the six budget knives we tested ($20 to $40 models) turned the basil black within five minutes. The drop-forged German knives fell somewhere in between, causing only a moderate amount of bruising and oxidation to the basil.</p><p>The daytime kitchen crew at Le Coucou used the MTH-80 for prep and during lunch service for a week and praised its outstanding performance on vegetables, herbs, and fish. Scott Markowitz, sous chef at Le Coucou, said, “[The Mac] was the favorite of all the cooks. We used it on shallots, herbs, and even slicing fluke for crudo. It was the best overall for basic <em>mise en place</em>.”</p><aside class="_5df8cec5"><p data-scp="pullquote">The MTH-80’s blade shape strikes the perfect middle ground between German and Japanese chef’s knives.</p></aside><p>Because the Mac’s stamped blade is made of very hard steel (it has a <a href="#about-blade-steel">Rockwell hardness of 59 to 61</a>), it will keep its sharp edge longer than softer blades, such as those of the Wüsthof Pro and Classic Ikon, which are hardened to 56 HRC. Adam Brach, sauté cook at Le Coucou, said, “I’m pretty sure [out of all the cooks] I do the most knife work in the morning as far as chopping shallots and onions and stuff. [The Mac MTH-80] held the best edge.”</p><p>Mac’s proprietary steel isn’t as brittle as the super-hard <a href="#about-blade-steel">Japanese VG-10 steel</a> manufacturers use for most gyuto knives. This means it’s less likely to chip, which the Tojiro knife did after we used it to cut hard butternut squash. And because the Mac model’s blade is slightly thinner than a German knife blade (measuring 0.0976 inch at the thickest part of the spine), maintaining its keen edge will be easier as you sharpen it throughout the years. In comparison, the Wüsthof Classic Ikon measures 0.1187 inch.</p><p>Across our 15 testers, everyone agreed that the Mac model was comfortable to hold and use. Most testers, including Sam Sifton, named the MTH-80 as their top choice of all the contenders. The blade geometry is unique in that the edge curve is more articulated than on a classic gyuto but not quite as extreme as on a German knife. It offers the best of both worlds. As one tester put it, “I really like this knife—Japanese design and German heft.”</p><p>Even testers with larger hands found that the handle gave plenty of knuckle clearance. By comparison, the Tojiro DP F-808 didn’t offer enough knuckle clearance for larger hands. Although the MTH-80’s handle is slightly short, most testers found it comfortable to grip.</p><figure id="attachment_16715" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Close up of the blade of the Mac MTH-80." data-src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chefsknives-lowres-5388.jpg" width="630" height="420" class="_612a0221 adccbe5e wp-image-56789 size-full"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> The Mac’s dimpled blade.<!-- --> <span class="wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit">Photo: Michael Hession</span></figcaption></figure><p>At 6.6 ounces, the Mac MTH-80 is lighter than a German drop-forged knife but heavier and sturdier-feeling than many gyutos. Part of that is due to the thickness of its spine: This Mac knife’s 0.0976-inch spine is relatively thicker than those of other gyutos we tested, which gives this knife some heft. In our tests, it didn’t feel as delicate when cutting through tough vegetables like butternut squash, but it still had the smooth slicing feel of a thin blade. By comparison, at their thickest parts, the Togiharu Molybdenum comes in at 0.0754 inch, the Tojiro DP F-808 at 0.0817 inch, and the Global G-2 at 0.0754 inch.</p><p>The Mac MTH-80 has dimples on both sides of the blade to reduce the chances of food sticking to the knife. We don’t think this feature is its biggest selling point. In our tests, the dimples were merely mildly effective, and we noticed the difference only when cutting butternut squash. Slices of squash stuck to the blades of every knife we tested, but removing them from the Mac’s blade was much easier.</p><p>Even though the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/7978/23481/4/51622?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/7978/23481/4/51622?merchant=Amazon">Mac MTH-80</a> tends to be on the pricier end of the knives we tested, we think its combination of performance and superior build will give you many years of happy use—much more than a budget knife.

Deputy editor Michael Zhao, who uses both the Mac and the Wusthof Classic Ikon regularly at home, said that the Mac is noticeably harder. He sharpens it “once a year or so,” whereas the Ikon needs sharpening every six months. His only complaint is that “the handle is a bit small in my hand, and I don’t have very large hands.” But as we’ve noted elsewhere in this guide, the feel of a knife in your hand has a lot to do with personal preference.</p></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="runner-up-tojiro-dp-f-808"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="runner-up-tojiro-dp-f-808-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">Runner-up: Tojiro DP F-808<button class="_2786f782" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="runner-up-tojiro-dp-f-808-panel" class="_11cbb9b1" aria-labelledby="runner-up-tojiro-dp-f-808" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><figure id="attachment_16717" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Knife on a cutter board with cut potatoes.

This classic gyuto has a flatter belly curve than our top pick, a design best for people who use a push-pull cutting style. In our tests, the thin, razor-sharp edge cut through vegetables with the precision of a scalpel. Thin strips of basil stayed green with little bruising or oxidation. Testers liked chopping vegetables with the Tojiro because of its sharpness, control, and easy handling. One colleague fell in love with the Tojiro DP F-808 and bought it immediately after the test. But it didn’t surpass the Mac MTH-80 for several reasons.</p><p>The Tojiro DP F-808 is shaped like a classic gyuto, with a straighter edge, no bolster, and a pointed tip. Its lack of a curve in the belly makes cutting with a rocking motion awkward. If that’s what you’re used to, we suggest adopting a <a href="#how-to-use-a-chefs-knife">push-pull cutting style</a>. We like this Tojiro model for slicing leeks, green onions, and herbs into fine julienne, but it’s also great for handling most fruit and vegetable prep, and slicing boneless meat filets.</p><aside class="_5df8cec5"><p data-scp="pullquote">The thin, razor-sharp edge cut through vegetables with the precision of a scalpel.</p></aside><p>Like the Mac MTH-80, the Tojiro DP F-808 has more heft than the lighter Global G-2 and Togiharu Molybdenum. The crew at Le Coucou noted that the Tojiro was heavier than they preferred (it’s only two-tenths of an ounce heavier than the Mac), but they rated its edge retention on a par with that of the more expensive Mac. Tojiro’s steel core is harder than the surface material; that hardness helps the blade hold a better edge, but it appears to be more brittle than Mac’s homogeneous construction. We found a tiny, almost microscopic nick in the Tojiro knife&#x27;s blade after cutting butternut squash. As it turns out, the <a href="http://www.tojiro-japan.com/faq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">company’s website</a> recommends the knife not be used for cutting pumpkin (or frozen foods), because the hard vegetable can chip your blade. But because this Tojiro knife’s core has the hardest steel of all our picks, its edge retention is exceptional for the price. We still believe this model is one of the best values in kitchen cutlery.</p><p>Testers with smaller hands found the Tojiro DP F-808’s handle comfortable and didn’t have any issues with their knuckles hitting the cutting board. But knuckle clearance was scarce for larger testers.</p><p>In <em>An Edge in the Kitchen, </em>Chad Ward cites Tojiro DP knives as “the bargain of the century.” He writes, “The quality of the handle fit can be variable, and the handles themselves are blocky, but the performance of these knives is outstanding, especially for the price.”</p><p>This Tojiro gyuto has been a popular knife in our test kitchen since 2015. We especially like its smooth slicing action and blade-heavy balance. Several Wirecutter staff members also have the Tojiro and love it. Kitchen writer Michael Sullivan has been using the Tojiro at home for about two years and said: “It continues to hold its razor-sharp edge with minimal sharpening.

Its factory edge is sharp, but not as keen as that of our top pick and runner-up. Compared with other German knives we tested, the Classic Ikon has a thinner blade, a more comfortable handle, and a more manageable belly curve for better leverage and control.</p><p>In our tests, the Wüsthof Classic Ikon cut smoothly through butternut squash and onions, although carrots did split slightly. Like the other drop-forged German knives, it caused moderate bruising to cut basil. Compared with the Mac model, this Wüsthof knife was less agile and sharp when peeling the skin from butternut squash.</p><p>The Classic Ikon 4596/20’s blade is thicker than the MTH-80’s, measuring 0.1187 inch at the spine. But it isn’t as thick as that of the Messermeister Meridian Elité (0.1461 inch) or the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Zwilling Pro (0.1298 inch). That thinner blade makes the Classic Ikon a tad lighter than other German knives and means it will be able to take a sharper edge than the thicker knives over the long run.</p><p>Many testers liked the Classic Ikon’s smooth, rounded handle, which fit nicely into the palm. It was much more comfortable than the Messermeister Meridian Elité’s handle, with its hard angles. The Classic Ikon’s gently curved blade also offered more control; the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Zwilling Pro and Wüsthof Classic Uber, by comparison, had such aggressively curved blades that they made simple cutting tasks feel awkward.</p><p>One advantage the Classic Ikon has over the Mac MTH-80 is that its stainless, softer steel blade is more durable. If you drop a Wüsthof into a sink or wait to clean it after cutting acidic foods, it shouldn’t stain or corrode. (But that kind of treatment will destroy the blade’s edge, so don’t do that to your knife.) On the other hand, that soft stainless steel also means that the edge of this Wüsthof model will dull faster and require more regular sharpening.</p><p>Wirecutter deputy editor Michael Zhao uses the Classic Ikon at home almost every day and loves it, though he said that he notices the difference between its softer steel and the harder Mac MTH-80. He has to sharpen the Ikon every six months or so, where the Mac can go at least a year between sharpenings. Wirecutter editor Jen Hunter also loves the Ikon, and said she’s used it for about 10 years. She likes the comfortable handle and appreciates the weight compared with lighter knives, which “often feel like they’re going to fly out of my hand.”</p><p>We also recommend Wüsthof&#x27;s Classic Ikon in our guide to <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-knife-set/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">knife sets</a>.

Simply hand wash and dry it thoroughly after each use. Never put any sharp blade in the dishwasher, as it’s not good for the edge to bump up against other things, such as glassware and ceramic—materials that are harder than the steel. Don’t use anything abrasive on the blade, such as a Brillo pad or a scouring sponge, which can make little scratches in the metal.</p><p>Never throw unprotected knives into a drawer, where they will dull quickly. Wall-mounted magnetic strips, such as the <a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/reviews/best-gear-for-small-apartments/#knifestorage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Benchcrafted Mag-Blok</a> we recommend in our guide to small-apartment gear, are better and safer. If you don’t want a magnetic strip mounted to your wall, buy a <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9593/27356/4/51627?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9593/27356/4/51627?merchant=Amazon">blade guard</a>. That way you can store your knife in a drawer and keep the edge protected.</p><p>Use your knife only on a wood, plastic, or rubber cutting board. Do not, by any means, let your edge hit glass, granite, marble, or ceramics—not even a quick slice on a dinner plate. Mastersmith Murray Carter explained, “Anything that has any degree of hardness that approaches metal, especially ceramic that’s 10 times harder than metal … as soon as it makes contact with the edge, it dulls it.”</p><p><strong>Honing and sharpening</strong></p><p>Keep a sharp cutting edge longer with a honing rod. Using this tool doesn’t actually sharpen the blade—its sole purpose is to realign the microscopic teeth on the edge that bend and get knocked out of alignment during the course of use. Although steel is a classic choice for honing rods, sometimes the material is softer than your knife, rendering it useless. A <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9594/27359/4/51628?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9594/27359/4/51628?merchant=Amazon">ceramic rod</a> is better because it’s harder than the hardest steel but has a smooth grit so it won’t chew up the edge of your knife while it realigns the edge. Hone your knife before each use, and you’ll be golden.</p><p>As you watch a chef whipping a knife down the rod toward their hand at lightning speed, it’s easy to see yourself taking a thumb off. But the task is not as difficult as it looks. You have two ways to effectively hone a knife.</p><figure id="attachment_16731" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Animated image of a chef whipping a knife down a rod.

If you’re starting out, it’s safer to place the tip of the honing rod on a cutting board, with the rod perpendicular to the board. Start with your knife toward the handle and then pull down from heel to tip. Repeat on the other side and continue for four or five reps.</p><figure id="attachment_16733" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_55d3ed1e global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="Animated image of a chef whipping a knife down a rod.

Depending on your use, that could mean every six months to a year. You’ll know it’s time when you have to work to get through skins of tomatoes or cucumbers. If you want to send your knives out for sharpening, it’s important that you look for a professional who knows what they’re doing. Unfortunately, that’s really hard to find. We suggest asking a local chef where they would send their own personal knives (not the cheap kitchen prep knives). Generally, chefs sharpen their own knives, but they usually know of a reputable knife person.</p><aside class="_5df8cec5"><p data-scp="pullquote">If you learn how to sharpen your own knives, you will have tools that are truly yours.</p></aside><p>If you learn how to sharpen your own knives, you will have tools that are truly yours. Murray Carter told us he highly recommended it. He said, “It’s a mentality perspective. Who in Western society ever thinks about sharpening their own knives?” Carter continued, “Once they have a new sharpening skill, it empowers them to have mastery over the cutlery they own.”</p><p>We like these <a href="http://www.korin.com/Knives/Medium-Nakato_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Japanese stones</a> and have used them for years.

After some education and a lot of practice, you’ll be able to sharpen any old knife to a pro-style edge.</p><p>In a previous version of this guide, we warned against knife sharpeners, but after doing research on sharpening and trying many such devices ourselves, we’ve found that not all knife sharpeners are created equal. If you’re investing in a quality, expensive knife like our main pick, we still believe that a whetstone used properly will provide the sharpest, smoothest edge.

In our tests we found that well-designed ones worked nicely, causing minimal wear to knives while creating a fine edge. And their convenience encourages people to use them regularly, which makes for safer chopping and a happier kitchen experience. However, make sure to avoid the cheapest knife sharpeners, which will quickly eat away too much of the blade’s metal.</p></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="about-blade-steel"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="about-blade-steel-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">About blade steel<button class="_2786f782" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="about-blade-steel-panel" class="_11cbb9b1" aria-labelledby="about-blade-steel" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><p>Steel hardness is measured on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_scale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rockwell C scale</a>. Decent high-carbon steel knives should register anywhere between 55 HRC and 64 HRC. Steel at the lower end of the scale is softer and more durable. Higher HRC ratings mean the steel is harder and more brittle.</p><p>Steel alloys for knives are formulated to increase stain resistance, machinability, and hardness; to improve grain structure; and to increase shock resistance. The composition of most German knives is X50CrMoV15, which roughly translates to 80 percent iron, 0.5 percent carbon, and 15 percent a combination of chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium. Chromium protects against corrosion and is what makes the knife stainless, while molybdenum and vanadium increase machinability and wear resistance, and refine the grain. This stainless steel is usually hardened to 56 HRC, softer than Japanese knives but capable of taking a beating well and withstanding up to a certain level of mistreatment.</p><p>Japanese steel generally has higher carbon content and, in addition to the ingredients in German steel, contains tungsten and cobalt, which improve hardness. VG-10, made by the Hitachi Corporation, is the most popular alloy and is what people think of when they think of Japanese steel. It creates hard blades that take and hold an edge very well but are also pretty brittle. This is why many gyutos are laminated with softer stainless steel to protect against shock and staining.</p><p>You will see knives made from American steel, and while some of it is fine for knives, a couple of formulas don’t perform as well. In <em>An Edge in the Kitchen, </em>Chad Ward writes, “I wouldn’t make garbage can lids out of 420J or 440A, but some manufacturers do use them for kitchen knives.” These types of steel are low carbon and highly corrosion resistant. They stay pretty but don’t hold much of an edge.</p><p>Quality stamped knives and drop-forged knives go through a heat-treating process, which gets the steel to the desired hardness. This process includes, but isn’t limited to, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_%28metallurgy%29" rel="noopener" target="_blank">annealing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenching" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quenching</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempering_%28metallurgy%29" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tempering</a>. In short, annealing relieves the steel of inner stress and prepares it for shaping and grain refinement. Quenching hardens the steel, and tempering relieves some of that hardness to make it more durable.</p></div></section><section class="ebe206b0" id="the-competition"><h2 class="_283d2745" aria-controls="the-competition-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">The competition<button class="_2786f782" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="the-competition-panel" class="_11cbb9b1" aria-labelledby="the-competition" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><p>We tested the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/29237/149087/4/82837/?merchant=Made%20In" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Made In" data-vars-store="Made In" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/29237/149087/4/82837/?merchant=Made%20In">Made In 8-inch Chef Knife</a> against our German knife pick, the Wüsthof Classic Ikon 8-inch, because they’re both Western-style kitchen knives.

The G-2 also comes highly rated by <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/129/Chefs-Knives-Rated" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cooking For Engineers</a>.</p><p>The <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/7977/23478/4/51631?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/7977/23478/4/51631?merchant=Amazon">Victorinox Fibrox Pro 8-Inch Chef’s Knife</a> was our previous pick and the favorite knife of<a href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/1433-chefs-knives?incode=MCSCZ00L0&amp;ref=search_results_1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> America’s Test Kitchen/Cook&#x27;s Illustrated</a> (subscription required) and several other food publications. It has an ergonomically shaped plastic handle that appeals to most people, including New York Times food editor Sam Sifton. In our tests, it was the only knife that failed to cut paper straight out of the box. The dull factory edge split carrots and couldn’t evenly halve a butternut squash. However, our testers preferred the Victorinox Fibrox handle over the Wüsthof Pro’s bulky grip.</p><p>The <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9604/27374/4/64651/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/9604/27374/4/64651/?merchant=Amazon">Mac TH-80</a> is similar to our top pick in both blade design and size. It lacks the weight and the smooth transition from blade to handle, though, and we found that it simply wasn’t as comfortable to use. The TH-80 isn’t made from the same cold-tempered steel as our top pick, so it probably won’t hold an edge as well as the MTH-80. However, at this writing, the TH-80 costs $50 less than our top pick.</p><p>Even though the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21645/118371/4/64652/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21645/118371/4/64652/?merchant=Amazon">Mac MBK-85</a> is an objectively good knife, our testers were pretty lukewarm about it. The edge was sharp and the knife itself was comfortable to hold, but the 8½-inch blade length was a little too much for home cooks. This model was one of the knives we gave to pro chefs to try, and no one mentioned it in any of our interviews as a favorite.</p><p>Like the Mac MBK-85, the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21646/118380/4/64653/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21646/118380/4/64653/?merchant=Amazon">Mac HB-85</a> garnered lukewarm reviews from our testing panel. The HB-85 offers a good price-to-quality ratio, but our testing panel overwhelmingly chose the Tojiro DP F-808 as the better chef’s knife for the price.</p><p>The <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21647/118385/4/64654/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21647/118385/4/64654/?merchant=Amazon">Tojiro DP Damascus F-655</a> gyuto is a higher-end version of the Tojiro DP F-808.

The slicing action was rough and the edge felt a little toothy. The Misen couldn’t make a straight cut down the middle of a butternut squash, and it split carrots instead of cleanly slicing through to the board.</p><p>Wüsthof designed its newest offering, the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21649/118389/4/64656/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21649/118389/4/64656/?merchant=Amazon">Classic Uber</a> line, to be a bolsterless version of the traditional Wüsthof Classic chef’s knife. But we saw one big problem with the 8-inch Classic Uber 4583-7/20: Its belly curve was much more articulated than those of other Wüsthof chef’s knives. Much as we did with the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Zwilling Pro, we found the Wüsthof Classic Uber awkward to use because of the extremely curved belly.</p><p>The <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21651/118393/4/64657/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21651/118393/4/64657/?merchant=Amazon">Mercer MX3 M16110</a> gyuto performed about as well as our runner-up from Tojiro, but it was considerably more expensive at the time of our tests.</p><p>In an attempt to find another budget knife to test for the 2017 update to this guide, we gave the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21654/118402/4/64658/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/wirecutter/out/link/21654/118402/4/64658/?merchant=Amazon">Mercer Genesis M21078</a> chef’s knife a try.

Another honorable dismissal, this knife is sharp and precise. Like the Tojiro DP F-808, it lacks knuckle clearance for large hands, but the Tojiro is a better value. This Togiharu model’s blade is thin, so we think it’ll be too delicate for hard vegetables.
